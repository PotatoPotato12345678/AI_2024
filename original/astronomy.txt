It is proposed that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double
neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological
distances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the
result of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger
differentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through
neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,
an optically thick fireball of size $\sles\ 100$ km is initially created, which
expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous
objections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted
that $\gamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational
radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.

The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars
by intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time
delays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the
gravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in
principle, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the
variation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\dot{G}$
which may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits
one may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\dot{G}$ today,
but unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort
to fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_0$ from lensing
observations.

The BATSE experiment on GRO has demonstrated the isotropic arrival directions
and flat $\log N$ {\it vs.} $\log S$ of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. These data are
best explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended
spherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius
is at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible
origins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars
recoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical
model leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole
anisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become
millisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of
gamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint. Quiescent counterparts
of gamma-ray bursts are predicted to be undetectably faint.

We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II
supernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are
explored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which
treat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux
dilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical
when their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type
II-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty
introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than
10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10
supernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN
1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide
range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing
the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101
and SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from
Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is
larger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness
fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher
method. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive
a value of $H_0 = 60 \pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to
errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved
by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II
supernovae.

We have calculated gamma-ray radiative transport in regions of high energy
density, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate,
discrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair
production and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The
radiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth
depends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical
divergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth
the high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly
universal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a
gamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit
for the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed. We discuss
more generally the problem of very luminous bursts, and implications of
Galactic halo distances for flare models.

Dust is observed to form in nova ejecta. The grain temperature is determined
by the diluted nova radiation field rather than the gas kinetic temperature,
making classical nucleation theory inapplicable. We used kinetic equations to
calculate the growth of carbon nuclei in these ejecta. For expected values of
the parameters too many clusters grew, despite the small sticking probability
of atoms to small clusters, and the clusters only reached radii of about
100\AA\ when the carbon vapor was depleted. We then included the effects of
cluster photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation from the nova. This
suppresses nucleation, but too well, and no grains form at all. Finally we
suggest that a few growing carbon nuclei may be protected from
photodissociation by a sacrificial surface layer of hydrogen.

We apply Perlick's (1990a) rigorous formulation of the Fermat principle in
arbitrary spacetimes to prove the correctness of the description of
gravitational lensing by gravitational waves, given in the literature using the
scalar and vector formalisms. We obtain an expression for the time delay due to
such nonstationary lenses; the advantage over previous papers is that Perlick's
formulation of the Fermat principle is very rigorous and more suitable for
practical calculations in some cases. It is also shown that ordinary moving
gravitational lenses must be considered as a stationary case.

The effect of the magnetic skew on the Parker instability is investigated by
means of the linear stability analysis for a gravitationally stratified gas
layer permeated by a horizontal magnetic field. When the magnetic field is
skewed (i.e., the field line direction is a function of the height), the
wavelength of the most unstable mode is $ \lambda \; \sim \; 10 H $ where $ H $
is the pressure scale height. The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is
greatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5
radian per scale height. Our results indicate that the Parker instability in a
skewed magnetic field preferentially forms large scale structures like giant
molecular clouds.

I present a model for acceleration of protons by the second-order Fermi
process acting on randomly scrambled magnetic flux arches above an accretion
disc. The accelerated protons collide with thermal protons in the disc,
producing degraded energetic protons, charged and neutral pions, and neutrons.
The pions produce gamma-rays by spontaneous decay of $\pi^0$ and by
bremsstrahlung and Compton processes following the decay of $\pi^\pm$ to
$e^\pm$.

We compare the spatial distributions of galaxy clusters in the northern and
southern galactic hemispheres, and the Abell and ACO clusters distributions. We
perform a statistical (correlation and cluster) analysis of a sample of Abell
and ACO galaxy clusters in the southern galactic hemisphere. We compare these
results with a symmetric sample at northern galactic latitude taken from
Postman et al. (1992). For the northern sample, we substantially confirm the
results of Postman et al. We find that the two-point spatial correlation
function of northern and southern clusters is comparable, with mean correlation
length 19.6 Mpc and slope -1.8 positive up to about 45 Mpc. Percolation
properties are remarkably similar in the northern and southern cluster samples.
We give also a catalog of superclusters. In the south galactic hemisphere the
main feature is a very rich, extended supercluster in the Horologium region at
a redshift 0.06, near to a large void.

A very weakly coupled scalar field with mass $m$ and initial vacuum
expectation value $V$ will provide enough mass to close the universe provided
$V\simeq (3\times 10^8\gev)(100\gev/m)^{1/4}$. We discuss possible models in
which such a field could arise.

The ability to now make measurements of Be and B as well as put constraints
on \lisix\ abundances in metal-poor stars has led to a detailed reexamination
of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in the $A\groughly6$ regime. The nuclear reaction
network has been significantly expanded with many new rates added. It is
demonstrated that although a number of $A>7$ reaction rates are poorly
determined, even with extreme values chosen, the standard homogeneous model is
unable to produce significant yields (Be/H and B/H $<10^{-17}$ when $A\le7$
abundances fit) above $A=7$ and the \liseven/\lisix\ ratio always exceeds 500.
We also preliminarily explore inhomogeneous models, such as those inspired by a
first order quark-hadron phase transition, where regions with high
neutron/proton ratios can allow some leakage up to $A>7$. However models that
fit the $A\le7$ abundances still seem to have difficulty in obtaining
significant $A>7$ yields.

In this paper we investigate the internal dynamics of the LMC cluster NGC
1978 through the use of Photometric (CCD images) and kinematic (stellar radial
velocities) data. We apply a variety of dynamical models to this data,
including multi-mass King-Michie models and rotating and non-rotating oblate
spheroid models. We discuss the cluster mass-to-light ratio and place
constraints on the cluster mass function.

In the standard inflationary scenario with inflaton potential
$V(\Phi)=M^4-{1\over4}\lambda\Phi^4$, the resulting density perturbations
$\delta\rho/\rho$ are proportional to $\lambda^{1/2}$. Upper bounds on
$\delta\rho/\rho$ require $\lambda < 10^{-13}$. Ratra has shown that an
alternative treatment of reheating results in $\delta\rho/\rho \propto
\lambda^{-1}$, so that an upper bound on $\delta\rho/\rho$ does not put an
obvious upper bound on $\lambda$. We verify that $\delta\rho/\rho \propto
\lambda^{-1}$ is indeed a possibility, but show that $\lambda < 10^{-13}$ is
still required.

Three colour photometry on CCD frames in the Special Area SpA23 provides a
deep probe of the galactic disc in a low absorption window towards the
anticenter. Magnitudes to better than 10% at V = 25 and B-V colour down to V =
23 have been obtained. These new data, used in combination with lower magnitude
photographic data in a wider field, give a strong evidence that the galactic
density scale length is rather short (2.5 kpc) and drops abruptly beyond 6 kpc.

Reanalysis of Einstein IPC data and new observations from the GINGA
  LAC indicate the presence of extended X-ray emission (10-50 kpc) around the
starburst galaxy M82. Here we model this emission by calculating numerical
hydrodynamic simulations of the starburst event to much later times and larger
scales than previously considered. For our models, we adopt a supernova rate of
0.1 ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, and an extended low-density static halo that is bound to
the galaxy. There are three stages to the evolution of the wind-blown bubble
and the propagation of the shock front: the bubble expands in an almost uniform
density disk gas, with a deceleration of the shock front ($t \alt $ 3.6 Myr);
breakout from the disk and the upward acceleration of the shock front (3.6
  Myr $\alt t \alt$ 18 Myr); propagation into the halo, leading to a more
spherical system and shock deceleration (18 Myr $\alt t$). For a halo density
of $10^{-3} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, the outflow reaches a distance of 40-50 kpc from
the center of the starburst galaxy in 50 Myr. We calculate the time evolution
of the X-ray luminosity and find that the extended starburst emits $3\times
10^{39}\lcgs$ to $10^{40}\lcgs$ in the
  GINGA LAC band and $\sim 10^{41}\lcgs$ in the Einstein or ROSAT
  HRI band. The degree of the ionization equilibrium in the outflow and its
effect on the iron K$\alpha$ line emission are discussed.

The tail problem for the propagation of a scalar field is considered in a
cosmological background, taking a Robertson-Walker spacetime as a specific
example. The explicit radial dependence of the general solution of the
Klein-Gordon equation with nonminimal coupling is derived, and the
inapplicability of the standard calculation of the reflection and transmission
coefficients to the study of scattering of waves by the cosmological curvature
is discussed.

As part of a stellar population sampling program, a series of photometric
probes at various field sizes and depths have been obtained in a low extinction
window in the galactic anticentre direction. Such data set strong constraints
on the radial structure of the disc. At the forefront of this "drilling"
program, very deep CCD frames probe the most external parts of the disc. Over
the whole effective magnitude range (18 to 25), all contributions in the
statistics which should be expected from old disc stars beyond 6 kpc vanish,
although such stars dominate by far at distances less than 5 kpc. This is the
signature of a sharp cut-off in the star density: the edge of the galactic disc
between 5.5 and 6 kpc. As a consequence, the galactic radius does not exceed 14
kpc (assuming $R/-/(//sun/)$=8.5). Colours of elliptical galaxies measured in
the field rule out the risk of being misled by undetected extinction.

The average flux decrement shortward the Ly$_{\alpha}$ emission, due to the
well-known ``forest'' of absorptions, has been measured in the spectra of 8
quasars. Quasi-simultaneous optical and IUE observations of the two low
redshift quasars PKS 0637--75 (z=0.654) and MC 1104+16 (z=0.632) have been
carried out, obtaining relatively high S/N, spectrophotometrically calibrated
data on their energy distribution from the rest frame H$_{\beta}$ to the Lyman
continuum. Six more quasars in the redshift range 2.5-3.4 have been observed in
the optical domain. For all the quasars the ``intrinsic'' continuum slope and
normalization have been estimated longward the Ly$_{\alpha}$ emission and
extrapolated towards the Lyman continuum to measure the average depressions,
which have been compared with the model statistics of the Ly$_{\alpha}$ clouds.
When all the known classes of absorbers are taken into account with plausible
values for their equivalent width distribution and evolution, a good agreement
is obtained with the observations. The results for the observed continuum
decrement at $z \sim 0.65$ are identical to those predicted by the evolution
with redshift of the number of Ly$_{\alpha}$ forest systems including the HST
data and within $2\sigma$ of the predicted value using the ``standard''
Ly$_{\alpha}$ evolution (as determined only at high z).

The suggestion has been made that the energy spectrum from point sources such
as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) and GBHC (Galactic Black Hole Candidates) is
universal, irrespective of the nature of the emitted particles. A comparison of
the energy spectrum for cosmic rays at the source and $\gamma$-rays from
quasars obtained recently by CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) indicates
that the prediction is in agreement with the data in the average sense. This
suggests that neutrinos from point sources should have a spectral index
identical to that of $\gamma$-rays for an individual point source. This
prediction is also consistent with the recent observation of neutrinos by
Kamiokande and IMB in which the ratio of $\nu_\mu/\nu_e$ is close to 1, instead
of 2 as expected from atmospheric neutrinos. For a further test of the model,
analysis of the time variation of $\gamma$-ray spectra from quasars is
suggested.

In this paper we have examined the age and internal dynamics of the young
binary LMC cluster NGC 1850 using BV CCD images and echelle spectra of 52
supergiants. Isochrone fits to a BV color-magnitude diagram revealed that the
primary cluster has an age of $\tau = 90 \pm 30$ Myr while the secondary member
has $\tau = 6 \pm 5$ Myr. BV surface brightness profiles were constructed out
to R $>$ 40 pc, and single-component King-Michie (KM) models were applied. The
total cluster luminosity varied from L$_B$ = 2.60 - 2.65 $\times 10^6$
L$_B$\sol\ and L$_V$ = 1.25 - 1.35 $\times 10^6$ as the anisotropy radius
varied from infinity to three times the scale radius with the isotropic models
providing the best agreement with the data. Of the 52 stars with echelle
spectra, a subset of 36 were used to study the cluster dynamics. The KM radial
velocity distributions were fitted to these velocities yielding total cluster
masses of 5.4 - 5.9 $\pm 2.4 \times 10^4$ M\sol\ corresponding to M/L$_B$ =
0.02 $\pm 0.01$ M\sol/L$_B$\sol\ or M/L$_V$ = 0.05 $\pm 0.02$ M\sol/L$_V$\sol.
A rotational signal in the radial velocities has been detected at the 93\%
confidence level implying a rotation axis at a position angle of 100\deg. A
variety of rotating models were fit to the velocity data assuming cluster
ellipticities of $\epsilon = 0.1 - 0.3$. These models provided slightly better
agreement with the radial velocity data than the KM models and had masses that
were systematically lower by a few percent. The preferred value for the slope
of a power-law IMF is a relatively shallow, $x = 0.29 \pmm{+0.3}{-0.8}$
assuming the B-band M/L or $x = 0.71 \pmm{+0.2}{-0.4}$ for the V-band.

We present a high S/N spectrum for the quasar PG 1138+222. We detect a very
broad HeII$\lambda$4686 emission line component with twice the FWHM of the
conventional broad line region (BLR) as evidenced by the Balmer lines. The
profile shape and centroid redshift also distinguish this HeII component from
the BLR features. The large ratio of HeII\l 4686 to any analogous H$\beta$
emission component is an indicator that it arises in a very high density region
($n_e \simgt 10^{11}-10^{13}$ \cm3). This Helium component is probably emitted
in a Very Broad Line Region (VBLR), where the radiation field is so strong that
the Str\"omgren depth becomes similar to the geometrical thickness of the
emitting clouds. The gas could therefore be optically thin to the Lyman
continuum.

The galactic magnetic field is commonly supposed to be due to a dynamo acting
on some large scale seed field. A major difficulty with this idea is that
estimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order
of $\sim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux
entrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of
a galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field
we find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to
maintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field
from all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than
previous seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic
activity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to
a dipole seed field of $\sim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a
seed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes
place in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic
clouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a
large scale $B_r\sim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller
scales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.

Self-consistent models of gamma-ray burst source regions at 100 Kpc distance
are possible if the radiating plasma is confined to very thin sheets, and I
estimate parameters. Energy sources might be elastic (by starquakes) or
magnetic (by reconnection), but mechanisms remain obscure. I discuss a very
speculative model involving collisions between comets in a hypothetical inner
Oort cloud.

The presence of brown dwarfs in the dark galactic halo could be detected
through their gravitational lensing effect and experiments under way monitor
about one million stars to observe a few lensing events per year. We show that
if the photon flux from a galaxy is measured with a good precision, it is not
necessary to resolve the stars and besides more events could be observed.

We present a multiphase model for the evolution of elliptical galaxies.
Diffuse gas, molecular clouds, stars and remnants are taken into account.
Cloud--cloud collisions and stimulated processes are the main causes of star
formation. The occurrence of winds driven by Supernovae is considered, and the
evolution of the system is computed also after the first wind, allowing for
further star formation from the restored gas. The evolution of the abundances
of 15 elements or isotopes is followed with detailed stellar nucleosynthesis.
Stellar lifetimes are taken into account and a new IMF has been adopted. The
gas removal due to the Supernovae explosions depends on the galactic mass and
the presence of dark matter; the subsequent wind episodes are crucial to the
intergalactic gas enrichment. Good agreement is obtained for current SNs rates,
Star Formation Rate and gas masses when compared to the available data.

Besides having some very interesting perturbatively unstable orbits, it seems
that for a Schwarzschild black hole, below $r=3M$, the force always increases
inward with increasing angular momentum. Here this previously known result is
derived with greater simplicity, and a similar analysis is performed for black
holes with angular momentum and charge.

Two families of hot stellar systems, named {\it `ordinary'\/} and {\it
'bright'\/}, are identified in the ($\log R_e, \mu_e$) plane built with a
luminosity--limited sample of ellipticals and bulges of S0s and spirals of the
Virgo and Fornax clusters. This finding, based on {\it ad hoc\/} new
observations, is confirmed by a much larger set of literature data for
$\sim1500$ galaxies. The {\it `ordinary'\/} family is biparametric: $L_T\propto
I_e\,R_e^2$; its members are fainter that $M_B\simeq-19.3$ and smaller than
$\re\simeq3$ kpc (whatever $M_B$ is). The {\it 'bright'\/} family is
uniparametric ($\mu_e$ depends on $R_e$ alone) and hosts brightest cluster
members and QSO parent galaxies. We show that the segregation in the ($\log
R_e, \mu_e$) plane has an important counterpart in the behavior of various
physical parameters, which is markedly different for galaxies smaller ({\it
`ordinary'\/} family) and larger ({\it 'bright'\/} family) than $R_e=3$ kpc.

If gamma ray burst sources are in the galactic halo they inevitably involve a
creation of an opaque pair plasma fireball, just like in cosmological sources.
We find that the typical physical conditions in a galactic halo fireball are:
optical depth $\ap 10^8$, thermal energy $\ap 100 KeV$, maximal relativstic
expansion $\G \ap 300 $ and a maximal baryonic load of $\ap 10^{-15} M_\odot$.
This does not rule out galctic halo models but it poses an addtional severe
constraint on all such sources. A comparison of these conditions with the
physical conditions at cosmological fireballs reveal that galactic halo
fireballs are less favorable than cosmological ones as sources of gamma ray
bursts.

$\gamma$-ray bursts have baffled theorists ever since their accidental
discovery at the sixties. We suggest that these bursts originate in merger of
neutron star binaries, taking place at cosmological distances. These mergers
release $\approx 10^{54}ergs$, in what are possibly the strongest explosions in
the Universe. If even a small fraction of this energy is channeled to an
electromagnetic signal it will be detected as a grbs. We examine the virtues
and limitations of this model and compare it with the recent Compton \g-ray
observatory results.

It is proved that the field of a gravitational lens induces no rotation in
the polarization vector of electromagnetic radiation, in agreement with the
previous literature, but with a different approach. The result is generalized
to the case of less conventional gravitational lenses (static cosmic strings
and gravitational waves).

By means of a general classification of the different kinds of matter of
nature form a chain from the world of the subatomic particles to the large
bodies of the universe, the galaxies. Then, it proposes a new baryonic force
for the universe that is the fifth force which has been proposed in the
literature. It explains the universal expansion itself and shows why the
expansion must be slowing down at present. This force depends on the ratio of
the number of neutrons to the number of protons. Its potential for the Universe
is a well. At the bottom of the well the potential is of the form $kx^2$, where
$x$ is the separation among the bodies under consideration. It is suggested
that Nature has six fundamental forces which are unified in pairs and,
therefore, reduced to three at $t=0$. The condition for having a closed
universe is found. This new force, called superweak force in this paper,
explains also the evolution of galaxies and shows how the arms of spiral
galaxies(including barred spirals) are formed. The variation of the Hubble
constant with time is shown. It is shown that quarks are formed of prequarks
which may be the true elementary particles. The paper also gives a physical
explanation for quark confinement. The energies of baryon states are calculated
in a simple manner. The paper proposes the existence of four more bosons, one
for the superweak interaction and three for the superstrong interaction. The
six figures will be sent by mail upon request.

Recent observations of Sgr A* give strong constraints for possible models of
the physical nature of Sgr A* and suggest the presence of a massive black~hole
with M<2 10^6 M_sun surrounded by an accretion disk which we estimate to
radiate at a luminosity of <7 10^5 L_sun. We therefore calculate the appearance
of a standard accretion disk around a Kerr hole in Sgr A* following from
general relativity and a few fundamental assumptions. Effective temperature and
luminosity of the disk spectra do not depend on the unknown viscosity mechanism
but instead are quite sensitive to variations of intrinsic parameters: the
mass, the accretion rate, the angular momentum of the accreting hole and the
inclination angle. A radiation field of L~7 10^4 - 7 10^5 L_sun and T_eff ~ 2-4
10^4 K can be ascribed to a rapidly rotating Kerr~hole (a>0.9) accreting
10^-8.5 - 10^-7 M_sun/yr at a black~hole mass of M=2 10^6 M_sunseen almost edge
on. A low mass black hole of M<10^3 M_sun seems to be very unlikely. We provide
a ``Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for black holes'' together with simple scaling
laws to provide an easy-to-handle test for the black hole model.

Could COBE DMR be detecting the imprint from a spectrum of gravitational
waves generated during inflation? The conventional inflationary prediction had
been that the cosmic microwave anisotropy is dominated by energy density
fluctuations generated during inflation and that the gravitational waves
contribute negligibly. In this paper, we report on recent work (in
collaboration with R. Davis, H. Hodges, and M. Turner) that has shown that the
conventional wisdom may be wrong; specifically, gravitational waves may
dominate the anisotropy in inflationary models where the spectrum of
perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance (e.g., extended and
power-law inflation models and extreme versions of chaotic inflation). If
gravitational waves do dominate at the large-angular scales measured by COBE
DMR, the expectation and interpretation of anisotropies on small-angular scales
is profoundly altered. Invited Paper for Proceedings of the Journees
Relativistes, Amsterdam, May 14-16, 1992

Extended inflation is a promising new approach to implementing the
inflationary universe scenario. This paper reviews recent advances including a
new, more robust mechanism for ending extended inflation, a new prediction for
the density fluctuation spectrum generated by extended inflation, and the
discovery that extended inflation can produce gravitational waves that can
significantly add to the cosmic background anisotropy. Invited Talk at the
Journees Relativistes, Amsterdam, May 14-16, 1992

Gamma-ray burst statistics are best explained by a source population at
cosmological distances, while spectroscopy and intensity histories of some
individual bursts imply an origin on Galactic neutron stars. To resolve this
inconsistency I suggest the presence of two populations, one at cosmological
distances and the other Galactic. I build on ideas of Shemi and Piran (1990)
and of M\'esz\'aros and Rees (1993) involving the interaction of fireball
debris with surrounding clouds to explain the observed intensity histories in
bursts at cosmological distances. The distances to the Galactic population are
undetermined because they are too few to affect the statistics of intensity and
direction; I explain them as resulting from magnetic reconnection in neutron
star magnetospheres.

We present spectrophotometric observations of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy OQ
208 (Mrk 668, 1404+286) obtained between 1985 and 1991. We show that the Balmer
line fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. The ratio of
intensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased
monotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components
of Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have
discovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement
and the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when
the line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not
compatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving
ballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a
system of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift
and luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems
that most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the
clouds. Theoretical line profiles suggest that the observed Hbeta profile is
best fit assuming the contribution of an ensemble which might be spherical or
confined in a thick disk in addition to a component emitted in a thin shell
contained in a cone of half opening angle 12 degrees seen along its axis.

The Seyfert galaxy NGC 6814 is known to show periodic variation of its X-ray
luminosity. We found that the sequences of peaks (variability patterns) in the
folded X-ray light curves constructed from the {\it Exosat} and {\it Ginga}
data are remarkably similar when one ignores amplitudes of the peaks and
considers only their phases. The stable pattern consists of five peaks which
are present in the both curves. The phases of the corresponding peaks coincide
with an accuracy of about 10 degrees. The probability that this coincidence
occurs by chance is less than about 1\% according to the most conservative
estimate. The observed stable pattern of peaks may be produced by a stable
distribution of ``bright spots'' on the accretion disk surface, {\it e.g.} by
strong vortices or magnetic flux tubes.

We examine analytically and numerically the evolution of a relativistic
fireball. We show that, after an early rearrangement phase, most of the matter
and energy in the fireball is concentrated within a narrow shell. The shell
propagates at nearly the speed of light, with a frozen radial profile and
according to a simple set of scaling laws. The spectrum of the escaping
radiation is harder at early times and softer later on. The results are
applicable to models of $\gamma$-ray bursts. Submitted to Monthly Notices of

Dynamical friction due to field stars and tidal disruption caused by a
central nucleus are crucial in determining the evolution of the globular
cluster system in an elliptical galaxy. In this paper I examine the possibility
that some of galactic nuclei have been formed by frictionally decayied globular
clusters moving in a triaxial potential. The initial rapid growth of the
nucleus, due mainly to massive clusters on box orbits falling in a short time
scale into the galactic centre, is found to be later slowed by tidal disruption
induced by the nucleus itself on less massive clusters in the way described by
Ostriker, Binney & Saha.
  The efficiency of dynamical friction is such to carry to the centre of the
galaxy enough globular cluster mass available to form a compact nucleus, but
the actual modes of its collisionless formation remains to be investigated.
  The mass of the resulting nucleus is determined by the mutual feedback of the
two mentioned processes, together with the knowlegde of the initial spatial,
velocity and mass distributions of the globular cluster family. Moreover, we
discuss the possibility that the globular cluster fall to the galactic centre
has been cause of primordial violent galactic activity.
  An application of the model to M31 is presented.

We calculate both analytically and numerically the evolution of a highly
relativistic fireball through the stages of free expansion and coasting, and
determine the dependence of the thermodynamic and radiation variables in the
comoving and laboratory frames. Magnetic fields may have been important in the
original impulsive event. We discuss their effect on the fireball dynamics, and
consider also their effects on the radiation emitted when the fireball runs
into an external medium and is decelerated. The inverse synchro-Compton
mechanism can then yield high radiative efficiency in the reverse shock,
producing a burst of non-thermal radiation mainly in the MeV to GeV range whose
total energy and duration agree with those of typical cosmic gamma ray bursts.

I develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum. The essential
assumption is that, due to fast convective motions, the free mean path
perpendicular to the magnetic field is independent of energy and has the scale
of the thickness of the shocked layer. I use the basic concept, that the
energetic Cosmic Ray particles are accelerated in a Supernova shock that
travels down a stellar wind. Discussion gives a knee energy expression, which
leads to a suggestion on the physical origin of the mechanical energy of
Supernova explosions, the gravitational potential energy mediated by the
angular momentum and the magnetic field. The spectrum below the knee is
$E^{-8/3}$. At the knee the particles segregate with particle energy according
to their charge. The spectrum beyond the knee is very close to $E^{-3}$. The
theory has been checked successfully against air shower data in two subsequent
papers (Stanev, Biermann, Gaisser, 1992 preprint; Rachen, Stanev, Biermann,
1992 preprint).

We mapped quiescent 807 GHz CO(7-6) emission from Orion along a strip in RA
extending from 0.7 pc west to 1.2 pc east of Ori theta 1C. The lines arise in
warm gas with T > 40 K. The line brightness temperature is > 160 K in the di-
rection of theta 1C, more than twice the dust temperature, and still exceeds 35
K more than a parsec east of theta 1C. The lines are narrow, with a max- imum
velocity width of 7 km s^-1 near theta 1C and decreasing to 1.5-3 km s^-1 at
the map boundaries. The density of the emitting gas is > 10^4 cm^-3 and the
column density exceeds 10^21 cm^-2. The correlation of the bright, narrow
CO(7-6) lines with 158 micron [C II] emission suggests that over the entire
region mapped, the narrow CO lines arise in warm photo-dissociation regions ex-
cited by UV photons from the Trapezium cluster. Although the Trapezium stars
lie in front of the Orion A molecular cloud, not all of the warm gas is at the
cloud surface. To the east of theta 1C the CO(7-6) lines split into two velo-
city components (also seen in 13CO(2-1) emission) which persist over several
arcminutes. Since only one of these components can be on the surface, the other
must arise from a dense, UV-illuminated clump or filament within the molecular
cloud. Comparison of the quiescent CO(7-6) emission to CO(7-6) ob- served in a
cross-map of the energetic Orion KL outflow shows that the lumino- sity of
shock-excited CO(7-6) emission in Orion is only a few percent of the luminosity
of the widespread quiescent CO(7-6) emission.

We consider the hot spots in FR-II galaxies as sites of first order Fermi
acceleration of protons to the highest energies observed in cosmic rays. We
estimate the attainable maximum energy in the hot spot region allowed by the
canonical physical conditions, which are found from radio-to-optical
observations (Meisenheimer et al. 1989, A&A). We calculate observable the
proton flux and spectrum from this sources, using all knowledge about source
distibution (Peacock 1985, MNRAS) and particle transport in the microwave
background (Berezinsky and Grigor'eva 1988, A&A). We get excellent agreement
with the cosmic ray data points at ultra high energies. THIS PAPER GIVES THE
FUNDAMENTAL MODEL FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THE NEW AIR SHOWER DATA OF THE PROTON
COMPONENT OF THE COSMIC RAY SPECTRUM BETWEEN 0.1 AND 1 EeV (Gaisser et al.
1992, Phys. Rev. D in press, Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted), which is
subject of a subsequent paper (part II, Rachen and Biermann 1992, A&A
submitted).

Aside from primordial gravitational instability of the cosmological fluid,
various mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure at
relatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phase
transitions. In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly
homogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly
sometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was
suggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving
relatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy.
In this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any
``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of
inhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity
involves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate
significant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that
the large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth
of inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same
inhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios
one can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic
fluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any
particular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but
only by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently
``pathological''.

The possibility of detecting proto-galaxies in the UV band is pointed out,
assuming that galaxy formation occured at z $\sim 5-6$. It is shown that the
diffuse gas in collapsing galaxy sized objects with temperatures $\sim
10^{6\pm0.5}$ K, and with a modest amount of metallicity, should copiously
produce emission lines from highly ionized Iron atoms. The expected luminosity
from models of galaxy formation is compared with the sensitivity of HST.

We review mechanisms for the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks
that are low mass, in the sense that the gravitational forces produced by the
material in these disks has a negligible effect on disk dynamics. There is no
established consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for
phenomenological reasons the traditional $\alpha$ model is probably not a good
description of real disks. We discuss models in which angular momentum
transport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter
is more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular
momentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as
competing mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible
dynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of
the internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large
radii drive an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo.

We present a short overview on the extragalactic background radiation from
radio to X-rays, with an eye to the relation to galaxy formation and
emphasizing on astrophysical backgrounds (as opposed to cosmological). As the
radio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable
estimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we
obtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux
contributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy
radio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs,
dominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction
of the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might
face problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify
the problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of
small scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests
that their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in
comparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains
considering two AGN populations: a "soft X-ray spectrum" population and a "hard
X-ray spectrum" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB
respectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection
dominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV.

We compare the expected contribution of FR-II hot spots to the ultra-high
energy cosmic ray spectrum (Rachen & Biermann 1993, A&A in press, BB paper
astro-ph/9301010) to improved experimental results. We introduce a "world data
set" of UHE cosmic rays by comparing the data of various experiments,
extracting relative systematic errors in the energy derivation and averaging
over energy bins. Since the contribution of FR-II hot spots is expected to be
dominated by protons, we can also compare it to the recent experimental results
for the proton component of cosmic rays between 0.1 and 1 EeV from both the
Fly's Eye and the Akeno airshower detector (Gaisser et al. 1993, Phys Rev D in
press, and Stanev et al. 1992, A&A submitted). The result is striking: Our
prediction for energies below 1 EeV fits very well to the data for the proton
component, while explaining the total flux at highest energies as well. The
result is consistent with the expectation of a galactic component, consisting
of heavy nuclei only, that has a slope of about -3.1 and cuts off at 5 EeV, as
predicted by Biermann 1993 (A&A in press, BB paper astro-ph/9301008)

Using Peebles' least action principle, we determine trajectories for the
galaxies in the Local Group and the more massive galaxies in the Local
Neighbourhood. We deduce the resulting angular momentum for the whole of the
Local Group and study the tidal force acting on the Local Group and its
galaxies. Although Andromeda and the Milky Way dominate the tidal force acting
on each other during the present epoch, we show that there is a transition time
at $z\approx 1$ before which the tidal force is dominated by galaxies outside
the Local Group in each case. This shows that the Local Group can not be
considered as an isolated system as far as the tidal forces are concerned. We
integrate the tidal torques acting on the Milky Way and Andromeda and derive
their spin angular momenta, obtaining results which are comparable with
observation.

Gamma ray burst sources are isotropically distributed. They could be located
at distances $\sim 1000$ AU. (Katz \cite{JK92}) GRB signals have many narrow
peaks that are unresolved at the millisecond time resolution of existing
observations. \cite{JK87} CETI could use stars as gravitational lenses for
interstellar gamma ray laser beam communication. Much better time resolution of
GRB signals could rule out (or confirm?) the speculative hypothesis that GRB =
CETI.

In the current paradigm there is a non-trivial bias expected in the process
of galaxy formation. Thus, the observed statistical properties of the galaxy
distribution do not necessarily extend to the underlying matter distribution.
Gravitational evolution of initially Gaussian seed fluctuations predicts that
the connected moments of the matter fluctuations exhibit a hierarchical
structure, at least in the limit of small dispersion. This same hierarchical
structure has been found in the galaxy distribution, but it is not clear to
what extent it reflects properties of the matter distribution or properties of
a galaxy formation bias. In this paper we consider the consequences of an
arbitrary, effectively local biasing transformation of a hierarchical
underlying matter distribution. We show that a general form of such a
transformation preserves the hierarchical properties and the shape of the
dispersion in the limit of small fluctuations, i.e. on large scales, although
the values of the

Arp 299C is a $5 \times 10^{10}$ \Lsun infrared source in the merging galaxy
system Arp 299. It is the most luminous object known that is not obviously
associated with a galaxy nucleus. Our data show that the 8--13 \mum spectrum of
Arp 299C has a strong \NeII emission line and emission features like those of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. These emission features are
characteristic of \HII regions associated with a burst of star formation. We
did not detect any high-excitation ionic lines characteristic of an active
galactic nucleus, nor a deep silicate absorption feature that might indicate a
hidden compact nucleus. We deduce that Arp 299C is powered by an intense burst
of star formation.

We generate artificial Lick maps using $N$--body simulations and compare the
angular correlation function, $w(\vartheta)$, measured from the simulations
with the APM correlation. For the Gaussian CDM model, neither the standard
biassed model nor a more evolved model (as suggested by the COBE data),
reproduce the correlations on large angular scales. We come to a similar
conclusion about CDM models with positively skewed initial fluctuation
distributions. In contrast, models with initially negatively skewed
fluctuations produce a $w(\vartheta)$ that declines much more gently on large
scales. Such models are therefore in principle capable of reconciling the lack
of large--scale power of the CDM spectrum with the observed clustering of APM
galaxies.

The information content of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of intensity
fluctuations of the X-ray background (XRB) is analyzed. The tight upper limits
set by ROSAT deep survey data on the ACF at arcmin scales imply strong
constraints on clustering properties of X-ray sources at cosmological distances
and on their contribution to the soft XRB. If quasars have a clustering radius
r_0=12-20 Mpc (H_0=50), and their two point correlation function, is constant
in comoving coordinates as indicated by optical data, they cannot make up more
40-50% of the soft XRB (the maximum contribution may reach 80% in the case of
stable clustering, epsilon=0). Active Star-forming (ASF) galaxies clustered
like normal galaxies, with r_0=10-12 Mpc can yield up to 20% or up to 40% of
the soft XRB for epsilon=-1.2 or epsilon=0, respectively. The ACF on degree
scales essentially reflects the clustering properties of local sources and is
proportional to their volume emissivity. The upper limits on scales of a few
degrees imply that hard X-ray selected AGNs have r_0<25 Mpc if epsilon=0 or
r_0<20 Mpc if epsilon=-1.2. No significant constraints are set on clustering of
ASF galaxies, due to their low local volume emissivity. The possible signal on
scales >6 deg, if real, may be due to AGNs with r_0=20 Mpc; the contribution
from clusters of galaxies with r_0~50 Mpc is a factor 2 lower.

We investigate the evolution of the skewness of the distribution of density
fluctuations in CDM models with both Gaussian and non--Gaussian initial
fluctuations. We show that the method proposed by Coles \& Frenk (1991), which
uses the skewness of galaxy counts to test the hypothesis of Gaussian
primordial density fluctuations, is a potentially powerful probe of initial
conditions. As expected, the mass distribution in models with initially
non--Gaussian fluctuations shows systematic departures from the Gaussian
behaviour on intermediate to large scales. We investigate the effect of
peculiar velocity distortions and normalisation upon the relationship between
skewness and variance. These effects are generally small for the models we
consider. Comparing our results to the QDOT measurements of the skewness, we
find that our initially positive--skew models are clearly excluded by this
analysis, but the available data do not rule out the negative--skew models.

We perform a detailed investigation of the statistical properties of the
projected distribution of galaxy clusters obtained in Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
models with both Gaussian and skewed primordial density fluctuations. We use
N-body simulations to construct a set artificial Lick maps. An objective
cluster--finding algorithm is used to identify clusters of different richness.
For Gaussian models, the overall number of clusters is too small in the
standard CDM case, but a model with higher normalisation fares much better;
non--Gaussian models with negative skewness also fit faily well. We apply
several statistical tests to compare real and simulated cluster samples, such
as the 2-point correlation function, the minimal spanning tree construction,
the multifractal analysis and the skewness of cell counts. The emerging picture
is that Gaussian models, even with a higher normalization, are in trouble.
Skew-positive models are also ruled out, while skew-negative models can
reproduce the observed clustering of galaxy clusters in the CDM framework.

We present new estimates of the observed rates of SNe determined with the
{\em control time} method applied to the files of observations of two long
term, photographic SN searches carried out at the Asiago and Sternberg
Observatories. Our calculations are applied to a galaxy sample extracted from
RC3, in which 65 SNe have been discovered. This relatively large number of SNe
has been redistributed in the different morphological classes of host galaxies
giving the respective SN rates. The magnitude of two biases, the overexposure
of the central part of galaxies and the inclination of the spiral parent
galaxies, have been estimated. We show that due to overexposure a increasing
fraction of SNe is lost in galaxies of increasing distances. Also, a reduced
number of SNe is discovered in inclined galaxies ($i>30\degr$): SNII and Ib are
more affected than Ia, as well as SNe in Sbc-Sd galaxies with respect to other
spirals. We strengthen previous findings that the SN rates is proportional to
the galaxy blue luminosity for all SN and Hubble types. Other sources of
errors, besides those due to the statistics of the events, have been
investigated. In particular those related to the adopted SN parameters
(Cappellaro et al. (\cite{paper1})) and correction factor for overexposure and
inclination. Moreover, we show that the frequencies of SNe per unit luminosity
vary if different sources for the parameters of the sample galaxies are
adopted, thus hampering the comparison of SN rates based on different galaxy
samples. The overall rates per unit blue luminosity are similar to the previous

We show that recent $\gamma$-ray observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud
with EGRET rule out a universal cosmic ray flux only at energies below $\approx
10$ GeV, while the observed diffuse X-ray and $\gamma$-ray background
radiations have already ruled out, by more than three orders of magnitude, a
universal extragalactic cosmic ray flux identical to that observed in the local
solar neighborhood at energies below $10^6$ GeV.

The measurement or constraint of the masses of neutron stars and their binary
companions tests theories of neutron star structure and of pulsar formation and
evolution. We have measured the rate of the general relativistic advance of the
longitude of periastron for the pulsar PSR B1802$-$07:
$\dot\omega=0\fdg060\pm0\fdg009\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, which implies a total system
mass, pulsar plus companion star, of $M=1.7\pm0.4\,\Msun$. We also present a
much improved measurement of the rate of periastron advance for PSR B2303+46:
$\dot\omega = 0\fdg0099\pm0\fdg0002\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, implying
$M=2.53\pm0.08\,\Msun$ for this system. We discuss the available constraints on
distribution of mass between the pulsars and their companions, and we compare
the pulsar masses with other determinations of neutron star masses.

The evolution of nonlinear density fluctuations around the Jeans mass shortly
after cosmological recombination is analyzed using a 3D
hydrodynamics/dark--matter code. The Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) exerts
Compton friction on free electrons due to peculiar velocities. The dynamics
therefore depends strongly on the gas ionization history. Under a variety of
ionization conditions and in systems with or without non-baryonic components,
the baryons lose angular momentum efficiently and collapse to form a compact
optically--thick object which would probably quickly evolve into a massive
black hole. Attention is concentrated on elucidating some of the novel physical
effects in early cosmological collapses, but ways in which more realistic
calculations might be made and in which the scenario could be incorporated into
a more complete cosmogonic model are discussed.

Using the concept developed in earlier papers, that the cosmic rays originate
in three different main sites, a) the normal supernova explosions into the
interstellar medium, b) the supernova explosions into a stellar wind, and c)
powerful radio galaxies, we demonstrate in this paper that the spectrum and
chemical abundances above $10^4$ GeV can be well understood. Using existing
data on the chemical composition of cosmic rays near TeV energies as a
constraint, we adjust the parameters of the model to fit the shower size data
from the Akeno experiment; this is necessary since the derivation of an all
particle spectrum involves an assumption about the chemical composition of the
cosmic rays and so we have to fit the shower size data first and then derive
the all particle spectrum. We present a successful fit to the shower size data
which allows us to draw three main conclusions: a) For most of the energy range
above $10^5$ GeV the wind explosions can account for both chemical composition
and spectrum including the knee feature, b) the highest particle energies
required from the stellar wind explosions imply a magnetic field in the
preexisting stellar wind of at least $3$ Gauss at a fiducial distance of
$10^{14}$ cm, c) the chemical abundances above $10^5$ GeV are dominated by
heavy nuclei such as Neon and higher. The bump observed in the all particle
spectrum below the knee gets weakened with the proper treatment of the energy
dependent chemical composition. For high energies we obtain an estimate of the
extragalactic proton flux.

Using a variety of parameters of local galaxy density, we have examined the
effects of the environmental density on the presence of bar structures in
spiral galaxies of various morphological types. For an extensive sample of
nearby galaxies, listed in the ``Nearby Galaxies Catalogue'' (Tully, 1988a), we
have found that the spirals characterized by a high local density tend to be
barred if they are early-type and early-type if they are barred (at the
significance level of $\sim$3 sigma), confirming some earlier suggestion of low
statistical significance. This fact, which is observed substantially in
low-luminosity spirals, indicates that galaxy interactions can stimulate the
formation of bars, primarily in early-type, low-luminosity spirals. This is in
partial, qualitative agreement with the most recent relevant N-body
simulations. On the other hand, no significant density segregation is observed
between pure S-shaped (S(s)) spirals and spirals with inner rings (S(r)), which
are often associated with bars. {\it Subject headings:} galaxies: general ---
galaxies: structure --- galaxies: interactions --- galaxies: clustering

We present images of the peculiar galaxy Arp~10 which reveal two rings of
concurrent star formation. Apart from a bright ring visible on early
photographs of the system, an even brighter inner ring of \ion{H}{2} regions is
found within the nuclear bulge of the galaxy. A very faint ring-arc of
\ion{H}{2} regions is also seen associated with a third outer ring or shell. An
investigation of the H$\alpha$ fluxes in the rings reveals an increase in the
emission where the ring surface density in the R-band light exceeds
21.3$\pm$0.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If the R-band light is dominated by old stars
in the underlying density wave, then the results suggest evidence for a Star
Formation law which exhibits a threshold dependence on the strength of the
density wave in the rings. Even if the R-band continuum in the ring is heavily
contaminated with red light from the underlying young stars then a smaller, but
still significant non-linear enhancement in the star formation rates (SFR) in
one segment of the second ring is required to explain the results. In either
case, strong trends in the SFR with azimuth around Ring~2 are in good agreement
with off-center collisional ring galaxy models.

This paper generalises King's models for tidally truncated star clusters by
including approximately the non-spherical symmetry of the tidal field and the
resulting non-spherical distortion of the cluster.

We investigate models of `intermediate' inflation, where the scale factor
$a(t)$ grows as $a(t) = \exp (A t^f)$, $0 < f < 1$, $A$ constant. These
solutions arise as exact analytic solutions for a given class of potentials for
the inflaton $\phi$. For a simpler class of potentials falling off as a power
of $\phi$ they arise as slow-roll solutions, and in particular they include,
for $f = 2/3$, the class of potentials which give the Harrison--Zel'dovich
spectrum. The perturbation spectral index $n$ can be greater than unity on
astrophysical scales. It is also possible to generate substantial gravitational
waves while keeping the scalar spectrum close to scale-invariance; this latter
possibility performs well when confronted with most observational data.

We develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum between 1 GeV and
10^4 GeV following the earlier papers of this series. We use the basic concept
that the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travels
through the interstellar medium. Physically important ingredients besides the
presence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic
cooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here
assumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result
is a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields
a spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then
leads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as
observed. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is
determined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of
electron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. Since
the highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, it
depends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher Z elements are predicted to
reach higher energies.

Pseudo-Goldstone bosons couple with photons through a P and T violating
interaction of the form ${\cal {L_I}}=g_{a\gamma \gamma}~ a F\tilde F$. Strong
magnetic fields in rotating compact stars induce a non-zero ${\vec E}\cdot{\vec
B}$ outside the stellar surface which acts as a source for the pseudo-scalar
field. Pulsar signals propagating through this pseudo-scalar `hair' suffer a
differential time lag between the left and the right circularly polarised modes
because of the P and T violating pseudoscalar boson-photon interaction.
Determination of this time lag upto a microsecond accuracy can lead to a
measurment of (or rule out) pseudo-Goldstone boson-photon coupling upto $g_{a
\gamma \gamma}\leq 4.6 \times 10^{-9}~GeV^{-1}$.

Techniques for the statistical analysis of the \Lya\ forest in high redshift
quasars are developed, and applied to the low resolution (25 \AA) spectra of 29
of the 33 quasars in the Schneider-Schmidt-Gunn (SSG) sample.We find that the
mean absorption increases with $z$ approximately as a power law
$(1+z)^{\gamma+1}$ with $\gamma = 2.46\pm 0.37$. The mean ratio of \Lya\ to
Lyman $\beta$ absorption in the clouds is $0.476\pm 0.054$. We also detect, and
obtain ratios, for Lyman $\beta$, $\gamma$, and possibly $\epsilon$. We are
also able to quantify the fluctuations of the absorption around its mean, and
find that these are comparable to, or perhaps slightly larger than, that
expected from an uncorrelated distribution of clouds. The techniques in this
paper, which include the use of bootstrap resampling of the quasar sample to
obtain estimated errors and error covariances, and a mathematical treatment of
absorption from a (possibly non-uniform) stochastic distribution of lines,
should be applicable to future, more extensive, data sets.

Curve of growth analysis, applied to the Lyman series absorption ratios
deduced in our previous paper, yields a measurement of the logarithmic slope of
distribution of \Lya\ clouds in column density $N$. The observed exponential
distribution of the clouds' equivalent widths $W$ is then shown to require a
broad distribution of velocity parameters $b$, extending up to 80 km s$^{-1}$.
We show how the exponential itself emerges in a natural way. An absolute
normalization for the differential distribution of cloud numbers in $z$, $N$,
and $b$ is obtained. By detailed analysis of absorption fluctuations along the
line of sight we are able to put upper limits on the cloud-cloud correlation
function $\xi$ on several megaparsec length scales. We show that observed $b$
values, if thermal, are incompatible, in several different ways, with the
hypothesis of equilibrium heating and ionization by a background UV flux.
Either a significant component of $b$ is due to bulk motion (which we argue
against on several grounds), or else the clouds are out of equilibrium, and
hotter than is implied by their ionization state, a situation which could be
indicative of recent adiabatic collapse.

A laser interferometric detector of gravitational waves is studied and a
complete solution (to first order in the metric perturbation) of the coupled
Einstein-Maxwell equations with appropriate boundary conditions for the light
beams is determined. The phase shift, the light deflection and the rotation of
the polarization axis induced by gravitational waves are computed. The results
are compared with previous literature, and are shown to hold also for detectors
which are large in comparison with the gravitational wavelength.

As long as there is no distance indicator to the sources of gamma-ray bursts
all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under
consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list. We use
the available data on the bursts' distribution of (the BATSE catalogue), and
the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate
whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the
angular distributions of bursts and comets' aphelia, assuming that the
distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true
variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the V/V_{max}
test to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\chi^2$
test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis),
including testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible
observational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two
distributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for
ruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo
simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$
it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.
Currently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large
disagreement found for the V/V_{max} parameter which makes the Oort cloud of
comets unlikely to be related to gamma-ray bursts.

We calculate reduced moments $\overline \xi_q$ of the matter density
fluctuations, up to order $q=5$, from counts in cells produced by
Particle--Mesh numerical simulations with scale--free Gaussian initial
conditions. We use power--law spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$ with indices
$n=-3,~-2,~-1,~0,~1$. Due to the supposed absence of characteristic times or
scales in our models, all quantities are expected to depend on a single scaling
variable. For each model, the moments at all times can be expressed in terms of
the variance $\overline \xi_2$, alone. We look for agreement with the
hierarchical scaling ansatz, according to which $\overline \xi_q \propto
\overline \xi_2^{~q-1}$. For $n\leq -2$ models we find strong deviations from
the hierarchy, which are mostly due to the presence of boundary problems in the
simulations. A small, residual signal of deviation from the hierarchical
scaling is however also found in $n \geq -1$ models. For the first time, due to
our large dynamic range and careful checks of scaling and shot--noise effects,
we are able to detect evolution away from the perturbation theory result.

Daily monitoring of PKS 2155-304 with the IUE satellite throughout November
1991 has revealed dramatic, large-amplitude, rapid variations in the
ultraviolet flux of this BL Lac object. Many smaller, rapid flares are
superimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period
when sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent
quasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and
long-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other,
and with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on
IUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the
sense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet
spectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between
spectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is
associated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1
day. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration
processes expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are
consistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for
quasi-periodic flaring. In contrast, currently proposed accretion disk models
are stronly ruled out by the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet variability.

As a first step of a program aimed to the detection of dark matter (or radial
variations of M/L) in early-type galaxies, we report deep spectroscopic
observations of the bulge-dominated edge-on S0 galaxy NGC 3115, made at ESO, La
Silla, using EFOSC at the 3.6m telescope and EMMI at NTT. Such observations
allow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii)
from the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \mu_B ~ 24 mag
arcsec**-2. The rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260
km/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range of
our observations. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has also been measured;
it decreases steeply from a rather high central value and flattens out
(<\sigma> ~ 100 km/s) within our observing range (a ~< 1.3 a_e). Models built
on these data and simple dynamical arguments show that the M/L of NGC 3115 must
thus be increasing from M/L = 6 (in solar units) in the inner regions (~ 1 a_e)
to at least M/L >= 10 in the outermost regions (~ 2 a_e).

We study the diffusion of helium and other heavy elements in the solar
interior by solving exactly the set of flow equations developed by Burgers for
a multi-component fluid, including the residual heat-flow terms. No
approximation is made concerning the relative concentrations and no restriction
is placed on the number of elements considered. We give improved diffusion
velocities for hydrogen, helium, oxygen and iron, in the analytic form derived
previously by Bahcall and Loeb. These expressions for the diffusion velocities
are simple to program in stellar evolution codes and are expected to be
accurate to $\sim 15\%$. Our complete treatment of element diffusion can be
directly incorporated in a standard stellar evolution code by means of an
exportable subroutine, but, for convenience, we also give simple analytical
fits to our numerical results.

We present optical and IR surface photometry of M51 (NGC~5194) at B~V~R~I~J~K
and CO$(2.3\mu )$. These data are used to establish whether K-band ($2.2\mu$)
images of spiral galaxies provide reliable maps of stellar surface mass density
features such as massive spiral arms or bars. The main distorting agents in the
mapping at shorter wavelengths are dust extinction and luminous young stars.
From modeling the color changes across the main dust lanes in M51, we find that
the K-band flux is attenuated by only $\ltorder 10\%$ even in the dust lanes.
From monitoring the gravity-sensitive CO$(2.3\mu )$ index across the spiral
arms we find that young, red supergiants do not distort significantly the
K-band image except in one small patch. On this basis, {\it we conclude that K
band images do trace the massive disk star population}. In M51 we find the
surface mass density contrast (arm/inter-arm) to range from 1.8 to 3,
comparable to results from N-body simulations of the galaxy's tidal encounter
with NGC~5195. The spiral arm amplitude in M51 also shows smooth, strong radial
variations, with a maximum at $\sim 130\asec$ and minima at $45\asec$ and
$170\asec$.

It is suggested that the nonorthodox model of a quasar as a neutrino ball
described in terms of the standard model extended by adding right-handed
neutrinos and the Majorana scalar field can be presented in order to explain a
quasar as a body of weak interacting neutrinos. Neutrino interaction with the
scalar Majorana field violates the lepton number and produces the mass
splitting of the neutrino due to the sea-saw mechanism. In this model a quasar
is an object which appears in the result of the first order cosmological phase
transition. In this interpretation a quasar may be regarded as a ball filled
with Dirac neutrinos and can be treated as a remnant of phase transition with
unbroken global lepton symmetry. In this paper we study the macroscopic
parameters of such a configuration. In the result the mass-radius curve M(R)
for the quasar is obtained.

The F0 V star 9 Aur A exhibits an irregular variability of amplitude $\approx
$0.1 magnitude at optical wavelengths. The variations are too slow for it to be
a $\delta$ Scuti-type star. There is no evidence for a close, interacting
companion or ring of dust, either from infrared, ultraviolet, or speckle data.
The photometric variability of 9 Aur A is similar to two other early F dwarf
stars: $\gamma$ Doradus and HD 96008. 9 Aur B appears to be an M dwarf, 9 Aur C
is an early- to mid-K dwarf star, and 9 Aur E, if it is a member of the system,
probably is a normal white dwarf. 9 Aur D is most likely an unrelated and
distant K giant. [See note added in press regarding a fourth member of this
class of ``variables without a cause", and short term variations of the radial
velocity of 9 Aur.]

We present the distribution of virial masses for nearby galaxy clusters, as
obtained from a data-set of 75 clusters, each having at least 20 galaxy members
with measured redshifts within 1 Abell radius. After having accounted for
problems of incompleteness of the data-set, we fitted a power-law to the
cluster mass distribution.

This paper contains all known errata in the book "Galactic Dynamics".

We present a study of the stellar content of the open cluster M67. We have
computed new evolutionary sequences of stellar models with solar abundance that
cover all phases of evolution from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to the bright end
of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). We examine the fit between the calculated
and the observed red giant branch (RGB) in particular, and discuss factors that
most influence its quality. The distinct color gap between the RGB and the
clump giants is compared with the temperature gap between the He-burning tracks
and the computed 5 Gyr isochrone. This purely differential approach strongly
indicates that the clump giants have M $\lta 0.70\msun\ $, implying an amount
of mass loss ($\approx 0.6$ \msun) well in excess of that found in globular
cluster stars. Observational constraints on mass loss processes favor the
interpretation that mass loss in cool low-mass giant stars increases with
metallicity.

We study scalar perturbations to a Robertson-Walker cosmological metric in
terms of a pseudo-Newtonian potential, which emerges naturally from the
solution of the field equations. This potential is given in terms of a Green
function for matter density fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude whose time and
spatial dependence are assumed known. The results obtained span both the
linearized and Newtonian limits, and do not explicitly depend on any kind of
averaging procedure, but make the valid assumption that the global expansion
rate is that of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model. In addition, we discuss the
similarity to diffusive processes in the evolution of the potential, and
possible applications.

If a substantial fraction of the observed gamma-ray bursts originates within
an extended Galactic halo then their spatial distribution should deviate
slightly from spherical symmetry in a very particular way which involves
features both in the bursts' angular and radial distributions.
  This conclusion is based on various reasons which are all related to the
presence and motion of the satellite galaxies around the Galaxy, and is
independent of the nature and origin of the sources.
  We analyze the spatial distribution of the bursts, according to the BATSE
catalog until March 1992, and argue that the expected signature of an extended
Galactic halo model is indicated by the data. The distance to the faintest
bursts in the halo is either $\sim130$ Kpc or $\sim270$ Kpc.
  Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is
very suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary
before regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence. If the increasing data
supports our results then gamma-ray bursts may be the first detected
manifestations of nearby intergalactic objects, either primordial or which have
escaped predominantely from our satellite galaxies.

Kouveliotou et al. (1993) recently confirmed that gamma-ray bursts are
bimodal in duration. In this paper we compute the statistical properties of the
short ($\le 2$~s) and long ($>2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis that
makes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the Galaxy
or at a cosmological distance. We find the 64 ms channel on BATSE to be more
sensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to long
bursts. We show that all the currently available data are consistent with the
simple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatial
distribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles.
The rate of short bursts is $\sim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. Although the
durations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitude
and the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typical
long burst by a factor of $\sim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of the
two kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\sim 2$.

Velocity dispersion $\sigma$, radius $R$ and luminosity $L$ of elliptical
galaxies are known to be related, leaving only two degrees of freedom and
defining the so-called ``fundamental plane". In this {\em Letter} we present
observational evidence that rich galaxy clusters exhibit a similar behaviour.
Assuming a relation $L \propto R^{\alpha}\sigma^{2 \beta}$, the best-fit values
of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are very close to those defined by galaxies. The
dispersion of this relation is lower than 10 percent, i.e. significantly
smaller than the dispersion observed in the $L-\sigma$ and $L-R$ relations. We
briefly suggest some possible implications on the spread of formation times of
objects and on peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters.

The nonlinear chiral extension of colour dielectric model has been used in
the present work to study the properties of quark stars. Assuming that the
square of meson fields develop nonzero expectation value, the thermodynamic
potential for charge neutral interacting two and three flavour quark matter, in
beta equilibrium, has been calculated up to second order in quark gluon
interaction term in the Lagrangian. The equation of state has been found to be
softer for higher quark masses and interaction strength. The quark stars
properties are found to be dependent on EOS. The mass, radius, moment of
inertia and gravitational red shift decrease as the equation of state becomes
more soft.

An exact numerical calculation of neutrino emissivity of two and three
flavour quark matter have been carried out. We find that the neutrino
emissivity obtained from the Iwamoto formula is in qualitative agreement with
our calculation for two flavour quark matter. For three flavour case, on the
other hand we find that the Iwamoto formula overestimates the numerical values
by $\sim$2 orders of magnitude or more for d decay and agrees with the s decay
results within a factor of 3-4. The dependence of the emissivity on
temperature, strong coupling constant and baryon density is also quite
different from the Iwamoto formula.

Typical nuclear equations of state and a quark bag model, surprisingly, allow
compact stars with alternate layers of neutrons and quarks. One can determine
on the basis of the Gibbs free energy which phase, nuclear or quark, is
energetically favorable. Using the nuclear equation of state of Wiringa, and a
quark equation of state given by Freedman and McLerran, the allowed quark
parameter space for such layer stars is searched. This paper differs from past
work in that configurations are found in which quark matter is located exterior
and interior to shells of nuclear matter, i.e., dependent on quark parameters,
a star may contain several alternating layers of quark and nuclear matter.
Given the uncertainty in the quark parameter space, one can estimate the
probability for finding pure neutron stars, pure quark stars (strange stars),
stars with a quark core and a nucleon exterior, or layer stars. Several layer
models are presented. The physical characteristics, stability, and results of a
thorough search of the quark parameter space are presented.

We develop a general method for power spectrum analysis of three dimensional
redshift surveys. We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical
uncertainty in the power and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting
scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that
the long wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. We apply the
formalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our
results to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the
Berkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify
the impression from e.g.\ counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on
large scales as compared to the standard CDM model with $\Omega h\simeq 0.5$.
We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with $\Omega h$ as a free
parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting
parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally,
we calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This
agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian
fluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal
no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.

If massive compact halo objects (\ms) are detected in ongoing searches, then
\tsmctlmc, the ratio of the optical depth toward the Small and Large Magellanic
Clouds, will be a robust indicator of the flattening of the Galactic dark
matter halo. For a spherical halo, \tsmctlmc\ is about 1.45, independent of
details of the shape of the Galactic rotation curve, the assumed mass of the
Galactic disk and spheroid, and the truncation distance (if any) of the dark
halo. For an E6 halo (axis ratio $c/a = 0.4$), the ratio of optical depths is
\tsmctlmc\ $\sim 0.95$, again independent of assumptions about Galactic
parameters. This ratio can be measured with a precision as good as $\sim 10\%$
depending on the typical mass of the MACHOs. If the halo is highly flattened
(\eg E6) and closely truncated (\eg at twice the solar galactocentric radius),
then the optical depth toward the LMC can be reduced by a factor of about two.
For these extreme parameters, and the assumption of a heavy Galactic disk and
spheroid, the upper limit of the \m\ mass range to which ongoing experiments
are sensitive is reduced from ${\cal O}(10^6)\,M_\odot$ to ${\cal
O}(10)\,M_\odot$.

We calculate the range of eigenfrequencies of radial pulsations of stable
strange quark stars, using the general relativistic pulsation equation and
adopting realistic equation of state for degenerate strange quark matter.

To detect brown dwarfs in the dark galactic halo through gravitational
lensing, experiments follow the luminosity of millions of stars to observe a
few lensing events par year. The luminosity of a star too faint to be
continuously followed can be temporarily increased above the detection limit by
a lensing. The detection of these invisible stars would increase the number of
events by a factor 2 to 7, and moreover their presence would confirm the
lensing interpretation of events due to continuously monitored stars.

There have been several recent suggestions that the Milky Way has rotating
bar-like features based on HI and star count data. In this paper, I show that
such features cause distinctive stellar kinematic signatures near OLR and ILR.
The effects of these resonances may be observable far from the peak density of
the pattern and relatively nearby the solar position. The details of the
kinematic signatures depend on the evolutionary history of the `bar' and
therefore velocity data, both systemic and velocity dispersion, may be used to
probe the evolutionary history as well as the present state of the Galaxy.
Kinematic models for a variety of simple scenarios are presented. Models with
evolving pattern speeds show significantly stronger dispersion signatures than
those with static pattern speeds, suggesting that useful observational
constraints are possible. The models are applied to the proposed rotating
spheroid and bar models; we find: 1) none of these models chosen to represent
the proposed large-scale rotating spheroid are consistent with the stellar
kinematics; and 2) a Galactic bar with semimajor axis of $3\kpc$ will cause a
large increase in velocity dispersion in the vicinity of OLR ($\sim5\kpc$) with
little change in the net radial motion and such a signature is suggested by
K-giant velocity data. Potential future observations and analyses are
discussed.

We study the importance of hydrodynamic effects on the evolution of
coalescing binary neutron stars. Using an approximate energy functional
constructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configurations, we
incorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay
driven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition
between the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and
the rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact. We show
that a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate
the coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close
binary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars.
Calculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, spins, and
effective polytropic indices. Typically, we find that the radial infall
velocity just prior to contact is about 10\% of the tangential orbital
velocity. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger
binary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also
consider the possibility of mass transfer from one neutron star to the other.
We show that stable mass transfer is impossible except when the mass of one of
the components is very small (less than about 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity
is high enough to maintain corotation.

Fragmentation of the planetesimals is found to play a role whose importance
is greater than previously believed and depends on the average characteristic
size of the primordial planetesimals but not on their mass distribution. In the
small size range the mass spectrum is strongly modified with the formation of a
small bodies tail but, on the other hand, the growth of the most massive
objects is significantly slowed down. The formation of planetary embryos much
more massive than the rest of the swarm is delayed; nevertheless the time-scale
problem for the growth of the outer planets is not revived.

We show that tidal interaction among galaxy clusters can account for their
observed alignments and very marked elongation and, consequently, that these
characteristics of clusters are actually consistent with them being formed in
hierarchical clustering. The well-established distribution of projected axial
ratios of clusters with richness class $R\ge 0$ is recovered very
satisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main
perturbers are relatively rich ($R\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of
clusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\ge 0$) located within a
distance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the
proposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects
involving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the
saturate regime (\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium
is reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all
clusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large
scale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when
estimating the virial mass of clusters.

The anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation
(CMBR) induced by the scalar and tensor metric perturbations are computed in
the long-wavelength limit. It is found that the large-scale polarization of
CMBR induced by the decaying tensor mode can reach a few percents. This is
different from the scalar or inflation-induced tensor mode, whereas the
polarization is at least two orders of magnitude lower. The effect of matter
re-ionization on CMBR is also considered. We conclude that measuring the
polarization of CMBR on large-angular scales can probe the ionization history
of the early Universe, and test different cosmological models.

Recent observations suggest appreciable star formation activity in early-type
galaxies down to redshift $z\sim 0.5$. If so, there is likely to be dust in
these galaxies. We consider the possibility that obscuration by dust can
reconcile the observed frequency of gravitational lensing of quasar images with
the considerably larger rate predicted in a low density cosmologically flat
universe dominated by a cosmological constant.

Based on 1) a conjecture about the mean free path for particle scattering in
perpendicular shock geometries, and 2) a model for Wolf Rayet star winds, we
argue that explosions of Wolf Rayet stars can lead through diffusive particle
acceleration to particle energies up to 3 10^9 GeV. As a test we first
demonstrate that the magnetic fields implied by this argument are compatible
with the dynamo limit applied to the convective interior of the main sequence
stars which are predecessors of Wolf Rayet stars; second we show that this
implies the same strength of the magnetic fields as is suggested by the
magnetically driven wind theory. Third, we use data from radio supernovae to
check the spectrum, luminosity and time dependence which suggest that the
magnetic fields again have to be as high as suggested by the magnetically
driven wind theory. This constitutes evidence for the magnetic field strengths
required to accelerate particles to 3 10^9 GeV. Fourth, we demonstrate that
within our picture the nonthermal radio emission from OB and Wolf Rayet stars
can reproduce the proper radio spectra, time variability and radio
luminosities. Fifth, the comparison of Wolf Rayet stars and radio supernovae
suggests that electron injection into the acceleration process is a step
function of efficiency with the shock speed as the independent parameter.

I present an extension of the thin layer approximation to non-axisymmetric
bow shocks. By choosing a suitable set of curvilinear coordinates that matches
the geometry of a generally distorted bow shock surface, I derive the fluid
equations for the flow. Analytical expansions are given for the matter flow
near the bow shock stagnation point. Numerical solutions are also obtained, by
using a revised Runge-Kutta method. This numerical method results to be
computationally stable and fast. When two winds interact, axisymmetric bow
shocks are expected to form only if both winds are spherically symmetric. But
stellar winds often present strong anisotropies: for all these cases a
non-axisymmetric model of bow shock is required.

We review recent progress in our understanding of the physics of energetic
particles in our Galaxy, in active galaxies such as starburst galaxies, in
active galactic nuclei and in the jets and radio hot spots of powerful radio
galaxies and radioloud quasars. We propose that cosmic rays originate mainly in
three sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the approximately homogeneous
interstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot
spots of powerful radio galaxies. The predictions based on this proposition
have been tested successfully against airshower data over the particle energy
range from 10 TeV to 100 EeV. The low energy cosmic ray particles carried out
by galactic winds to the intergalactic medium may ionize and heat this medium
consistent with all known constraints. Furthermore we propose that radioloud
quasars accelerate nuclei to high energies in shocks in the inner sections of
their jets, and thus initiate hadronic cascades which produce the $\gamma$-ray
emission observed with GRO. Radio observations of the Galactic center compact
source suggest that there is a jet similar to that in quasars, but very much
weaker in its emission; simple modelling suggests that the power carried by
this jet is of order similar to the accretion disk luminosity. By analogy we
speculate that also radioweak quasars have jets which carry a large proportion
of the accretion power, and which accelerate particles to high energy.

The burning of a neutron star by strange matter is analyzed using
relativistic combustion theory with a planar geometry. It is shown that such
burning is probably neither slow combustion nor simple detonation. Fast
combustion without detonation is possible under certain circumstances, but
would involve very efficient heat transfer mechanisms. It is found, however,
that the burning is most likely absolutely unstable with no well defined burn
front.

We analyze the statistical properties of bubble models for the large-scale
distribution of galaxies. To this aim, we realize static simulations, in which
galaxies are mostly randomly arranged in the regions surrounding bubbles. As a
first test, we realize simulations of the Lick map, by suitably projecting the
three-dimensional simulations. In this way, we are able to safely compare the
angular correlation function implied by a bubbly geometry to that of the APM
sample. We find that several bubble models provide an adequate amount of
large-scale correlation, which nicely fits that of APM galaxies. Further, we
apply the statistics of the count-in-cell moments to the three-dimensional
distribution and compare them with available observational data on variance,
skewness and kurtosis. Based on our purely geometrical constructions, we find
that a well defined hierarchical scaling of higher order moments up to scales
$\sim 70\hm$. The overall emerging picture is that the bubbly geometry is well
suited to reproduce several aspects of large-scale clustering.

We study the dynamical evolution of idealised stellar systems by averaging
results from many $N$-body simulations, each having modest numbers of stars.
For isolated systems with stars of uniform mass, we discuss aspects of
evolution up to the point of core collapse: relaxation and its $N$-dependence,
the evolution of the density profile, the development of the velocity
dispersion and anisotropy, and the rate of stellar escape.

One of the crucial aspects of density perturbations that are produced by the
standard inflation scenario is that they are Gaussian where seeds produced by
topological defects tend to be non-Gaussian. The three point correlation
function of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CBR) provides a sensitive test of this aspect of the primordial
density field. In this paper, this function is calculated in the general
context of various allowed non-Gaussian models. It is shown that by COBE and
the forthcoming South Pole and Balloon CBR anisotropy data may be able to test
provide a crucial test of Gaussianity.

We study the possibility of mixed dark matter obtained through the phase
space distribution of a single particle. An example is offered in the context
of SUSY models with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. Axinos in the 100 keV range can
naturally have both thermal and non-thermal components. The latter one arises
from the lightest neutralino decays and derelativizes at z ~ 10^4.

We report results from high-resolution particle-mesh (PM) N-body simulations
of structure formation in an $\Omega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of
Cold plus Hot Dark Matter (C+HDM) having $\Omega_{\rm cold}=0.6$,
$\Omega_\nu=0.3$, and $\Omega_{\rm baryon}=0.1$. We present analytic fits to
the C+HDM power spectra for both cold and hot ($\nu$) components, which provide
initial conditions for our nonlinear simulations. In order to sample the
neutrino velocities adequately, these simulations included six times as many
neutrino particles as cold particles. Our simulation boxes were 14, 50, and
200~Mpc cubes (with $H_0=50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$); we also did comparison
simulations for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in a 50~Mpc box. C+HDM with linear bias
factor $b=1.5$ is consistent both with the COBE data and with the galaxy
correlations we calculate. We find the number of halos as a function of mass
and redshift in our simulations; our results for both CDM and C+HDM are well
fit by a Press-Schechter model. The number density of galaxy-mass halos is
smaller than for CDM, especially at redshift $z>2$, but the numbers of
cluster-mass halos are comparable. We also find that on galaxy scales the
neutrino velocities and flatter power spectrum in C+HDM result in galaxy
pairwise velocities that are in good agreement with the data, and about 30\%
smaller than in CDM with the same biasing factor. On scales of several tens of
Mpc, the C+HDM streaming velocities are considerably larger than CDM. Thus
C+HDM looks promising as a model of structure formation.

We have obtained spectra of the reflection nebulosity illuminated by two
heavily embedded IRAS sources in the L1641 molecular cloud, Re 50 and IC 430
(V883 Ori). Examination of these spectra in combination with their other
properties indicates that these objects are FU Orionis objects. Our spectrum of
L1551 IRS 5 confirms the FU Ori classification made for this star by Mundt et
al. (1985).

We demonstrate that the accretion disk model for the Galactic Center region
by Linden et al (1993a) is applicable for at least one order of magnitude in
radius from the Galactic Center (10 ... 100 pc). The viscosity $\nu$ is shown
to be weakly dependent on the radius $s$: $\nu \sim s^{0.4}$. Finally, we
discuss the influence of the inner boundary on the structure of the inner disk
regions.

The possible conversion of neutron matter to strange matter and its relevance
to astrophysical problems are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the
{\it form} in which this hypothetical burning process should be propagated in
dense matter and to the {\it moment} when it should start.

Small number statistics may heavily affect the structure of the broadening
function in integrated spectra of galactic globular cluster centers. As a
consequence, it is a priori unknown how closely line broadening measure- ments
gauge the intrinsic velocity dispersions at the cores of these stel- lar
systems. We have tackled this general problem by means of Monte Carlo
simulations. An examination of the mode and the frequency distribution of the
measured values of the simulations indicates that the low value measured for
the velocity dispersion of M30 (Zaggia etal 1992) is likely a reliable estimate
of the velocity dispersion at the center of this cluster. The same methodology
applied to the case of M15 suggests that the steep inward rise of the velocity
dispersion found by Peterson, Seitzer and Cudworth (1989) is real, although
less pronounced. Large-aperture observa- tions are less sensitive to
statistical fluctuations, but are unable to detect strong variations in the
dispersion wich occur within the aperture itself.

We derive the volume-averaged 2, 3, 4, and 5-point correlation functions from
the moments of the Count probability distribution function of a redshift survey
of IRAS galaxies, and find them all to be reasonably well-described by power
laws. Weak systematic effects with the sample size provide evidence for
stronger clustering of galaxies of higher luminosity on small scales.
Nevertheless, remarkably tight relationships hold between the correlation
functions of different order. In particular, the ``normalized" skewness defined
by the ratio $S_3\equiv \bar{\xi_3} / \bar{\xi_2}^2$ varies at most weakly with
scale in the range $0.1 < \bar{\xi_2} < 10$. That is, $S_3$ is close to
constant ($=1.5\pm 0.5$) from weakly to strongly non-linear scales.
Furthermore, we find that the void probability function obeys a scaling
relation with density to great precision, in accord with the scale-invariance
hypothesis ($\bar{\xi_N}\propto\bar{\xi_2}^{N-1}$).

We suggest to use the common appearance of voids with a scale of $5000 \kms$
in the galaxy distribution to estimate the power spectrum on this scale. We use
a simple model for a gravitational formation of voids and we compare the
results with the matter fluctuations as constrained by the CMBR observations of
COBE. We find that a power spectrum $P(k)\propto k^n$ with $n \approx 1.25$ is
compatible both with COBE and with gravitational growth of large voids in an
$\Omega=1$ universe. A Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum, $n=1$, normalized to
produce the observed CMBR fluctuations, does not have enough power for
gravitational growth of voids with a diameter of $5000 \kms$ in an $\Omega=1$
Universe. Such a spectrum would be compatible if (i) void diameters are smaller
($3500 \kms$), the voids are shallower or if the voids are rare (we assume that
the universe is void filled); (ii) $\Omega < 1$ i.e. the Universe is open;
(iii) galaxies do not trace matter on very large scale or if (iv) the voids do
not grow gravitationally.

The hydrodynamic stability of deflagration and detonation bubbles for a first
order electroweak and QCD phase transition has been discussed recently with the
suggestion that detonations are stable. We examine here the case of a
detonation more carefully. We find that in front of the bubble wall
perturbations do not grow with time, but behind the wall modes exist which grow
exponentially. We briefly discuss the possible meaning of this instability.

Observations from the first flight of the Medium Scale Anisotropy Measurement
(MSAM) are analyzed to place limits on Gaussian fluctuations in the Cosmic
Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). This instrument chops a 30\arcmin\ beam
in a 3 position pattern with a throw of $\pm40\arcmin$; the resulting data is
analyzed in statistically independent single and double difference datasets. We
observe in four spectral channels at 5.6, 9.0, 16.5, and 22.5~\icm, allowing
the separation of interstellar dust emission from CMBR fluctuations. The dust
component is correlated with the \IRAS\ 100~\micron\ map. The CMBR component
has two regions where the signature of an unresolved source is seen. Rejecting
these two source regions, we obtain a detection of fluctuations which match
CMBR in our spectral bands of $0.6 \times 10^{-5} < \Delta T/T < 2.2 \times
10^{-5}$ (90\% CL interval) for total rms Gaussian fluctuations with
correlation angle 0\fdg5, using the single difference demodulation. For the
double difference demodulation, the result is $1.1 \times 10^{-5} < \Delta T/T
< 3.1 \times 10^{-5}$ (90\% CL interval) at a correlation angle of 0\fdg3.

Long slit spectra of the region around the Luminous Blue Variable AG Car
obtained in June 1990, just before the onset of its new brightening phase,
indicate that AG Car was in the hottest phase so far recorded. The spectrum
shows strong broad emissions of He II 468.6 nm, and [Fe III] 465.8-470.1 nm,
and He I, N II, Si III, Al III and Fe III with a P Cygni profile. We have also
identified weak lines of C II and O II. A faint continuum emission has been
detected within the whole ring nebula. We also find that the spectrum of some
regions is partially due to scattered star's light. This provides evidence of
the presence of dust grains, and indicates that even in present times dust is
condensing from AG Car wind. The sharp outer edge of the ring suggest the
presence of a shock front. We have also identified an extended low density H II
$halo$, which should be associated with the residual of the stellar wind of a
previous cooler evolutionary phase of AG Car. In the halo the H$\alpha$/[N II]
ratio is strengthened with respect to the ring nebula, possibly because of a
discontinuity in the N abundance. We suggest that part of the star's reddening
originates in the ring nebula and diffuse halo, which could alter the present
estimates of the star's distance. The extracted spectrograms are available as
computer files on request to rossi@astrom.astro.it. Article in press in A\&A.

We have found previously unreported observations of the galactic Luminous
Blue Variable $\eta ~Car$ covering the period 1860-1865. Contrary to the
current belief, these data suggest that the star reached the first magnitude in
1860-1862, with possible large luminosity fluctuations, followed by a steep
fading in 1865. A revised historical light curve of this most interesting
object is given. Paper in press in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

We present Lick Observatory slit spectra of 38 objects which were claimed to
have pronounced ultraviolet excess and emission lines by Zhan \& Chen. Most of
our spectra have FWHM spectral resolutions of about 4~\AA , and relatively high
S/N of about 10 -- 50, although some have FWHM $\simeq 15$~\AA ~or lower S/N.
We find eleven QSOs, four galaxies at $z \simeq 0.1$, twenty-two stars and one
unidentified object with a low S/N spectrum. Six of the QSOs show absorption
systems, including Q0000+027A with a relatively strong associated C~IV
absorption system, and Q0008+008 (V$\simeq 18.9$) with a damped Ly$\alpha $
system with an H~I column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The stars include a
wide variety of spectral types. There is one new DA4 white dwarf at 170~pc, one
sdB at 14~kpc, and three M stars. The rest are of types F, G and K. We have
measured the equivalent widths of the Ca~II~K line, the G-band and the Balmer
lines in ten stars with the best spectra, and we derive metallicities. Seven of
them are in the range $-2.5 \leq$~[Fe/H]~$\leq -1.7$, while the others are less
metal poor. If the stars are dwarfs, then they are at distances of 1 to 7~kpc,
but if they are giants, typical distances will be about 10~kpc.

We analyze the ultraviolet (UV) emission line and continuum properties of
five low-redshift active galactic nuclei (four luminous quasars:
PKS~0405$-$123, H1821+643, PG~0953+414, and 3C273, and one bright Seyfert 1
galaxy: Mrk~205). The HST spectra have higher signal-to-noise ratios (typically
$\sim 60$ per resolution element) and spectral resolution ($R = 1300$) than all
previously- published UV spectra used to study the emission characteristics of
active galactic nuclei. We include in the analysis ground-based optical spectra
covering \hb\ and the narrow [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 doublet. The
following new results are obtained: \lyb/\lya=0.03$-$0.12 for the four quasars,
which is the first accurate measurement of the long-predicted \lyb\ intensity
in QSOs. The cores of \lya\ and C~IV are symmetric to an accuracy of better
than
  2.5% within about 2000 km s$^{-1}$ of the line peak. This high degree of
symmetry of \lya\ argues against models in which the broad line cloud velocity
field has a significant radial component. The observed smoothness of the \lya\
and C~IV line profiles requires at least $\sim 10^4$ individual clouds if bulk
velocity is the only line-broadening mechanism. The overall similarity of the
\lya\ and C IV $\lambda$1549 profiles rules out models for the broad line
region (BLR) with a radial distribution of virialized....

Although delta Scorpii is a bright and well-studied star, the details of its
multiplicity have remained unclear. Here we present the first
diffraction-limited image of this 0.12 arcsec binary star, made using optical
interferometry, and resolve the confusion that has existed in the literature
over its multiplicity.
  Examining published speckle measurements, together with the present result,
reveals a periodicity of 10.5 yr and allows calculation of the orbital
parameters. The orbit has a high eccentricity (e=0.82) and large inclination
(i=70 degrees), making it a favourable target for radial velocity measurements
during the next periastron (in 2000).

This paper analyses the effects of random noise in determining errors and
confidence levels for galaxy redshifts obtained by cross-correlation
techniques. The main finding is that confidence levels have previously been
overestimated, and errors inaccurately calculated in certain applications. New
formul\ae\ are presented.

To examine how peculiar velocities can affect the 2-, 3-, and 4-point
redshift correlation functions, we evaluate volume-average correlations for
configurations that emphasize and minimize redshift distortions for four
different volume-limited samples from each of the CfA, SSRS, and IRAS redshift
catalogs. We find a characteristic distortion for the 2-point correlation,
$\xibar_2$: the slope $\gamma$ is flatter and the correlation length is larger
in redshift space than in real space; that is, redshift distortions ``move''
correlations from small to large scales. At the largest scales (up to $12
\Mpc$), the extra power in the redshift distribution is compatible with
$\Omega^{4/7}/b \approx 1$. We estimate $\Omega^{4/7}/b$ to be $0.53 \pm 0.15$,
$1.10 \pm 0.16$ and $0.84 \pm 0.45$ for the CfA, SSRS and IRAS catalogs. Higher
order correlations $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_4$ suffer similar redshift
distortions, but in such a way that, within the accuracy of our analysis, the
normalized amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are insensitive to this effect. The
hierarchical amplitudes $S_3$ and $S_4$ are constant as a function of scale
between 1--$12 \Mpc$ and have similar values in all samples and catalogues,
$S_3 \approx 2$ and $S_4 \approx 6$, despite the fact that $\xibar_2$,
$\xibar_3$, and $\xibar_4$ differ from one sample to another by large factors
(up to a factor of 4 in $\xibar_2$, 8 for $\xibar_3$, and 12 for $\xibar_4$).
The agreement between the independent estimations of $S_3$ and $S_4$

We compare the results for the dynamical evolution of star clusters derived
from anisotropic gaseous models with the data from N-body simulations of
isolated and one-component systems, each having modest number of stars. The
statistical quality of N-body data was improved by averaging results from many
N-body runs, each with the same initial parameters but with different sequences
of random numbers used to initialize positions and velocities of the particles.
We study the development of anisotropy, the spatial evolution and energy
generation by three-body binaries and its N-dependence. We estimate the
following free parameters of anisotropic gaseous models: the time scale for
collisional anisotropy decay and the coefficient in the formulae for energy
generation by three-body binaries. To achieve a fair agreement between N-body
and gaseous models for the core in pre- as well as in post-collapse only the
energy generation by binaries had to be varied by N. We find that anisotropy
has considerable influence on the spatial structure of the cluster particularly
for the intermediate and outer regions.

This preprint is based on two articles accepted by MNRAS and ApJ.
  Our aim is to study the evolution of the orbit of a star under the influence
of interactions with an accretion disc in an AGN. The model considered consists
of a low-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole and colliding
periodically with the accretion disc. Gravitational field of the nucleus is
described by the Kerr metric. The star is assumed to move along a geodesic arc
between successive interactions with an equatorial accretion disc. We study the
gravitomagnetic (Lense-Thirring) precession of the trajectory. We do not assume
any particular value for the eccentricity or inclination of the orbit or the
angular momentum of the black hole. We also discuss the periodicity related to
the relativistic shift of the pericenter.
  The model of star-disc interactions has been suggested to explain the X-ray
variability observed in the Seyfert galaxy NGC~6814. We briefly discuss on this
subject.

Gamma ray production in supernova remnants is discussed on the basis of
current ideas about cosmic ray acceleration.

The ionization history of the universe provides a major source of ambiguity
in constraining cosmological models using small angular scale microwave
background anisotropies. To clarify these issues, we consider a complete
treatment of Compton scattering to second order, an approach which may be
applicable to other astrophysical situations. We find that only the ${\cal O}
(v)$ Doppler effect, and the ${\cal O} (v\delta)$ Vishniac effect are important
for recent last scattering epochs; the ${\cal O} (v^2)$ Doppler effect is not
significant on any angular scale, and other higher-order effects are completely
negligible. However the ${\cal O}(v^2)$ effect does lead to \Cy\ distortions,
which although generally below current constraints, set an unavoidable minimum
level in reionization models. We consider the small-angle approximation for the
Vishniac effect in detail, and show several improvements over previous
treatments, particularly for low $\Omega_0$. For standard cold dark matter
models, the effect of reionization is to redistribute the anisotropies to
arcminute scales; late reionization leads to partially erased primary
fluctuations and a secondary contribution of comparable magnitude. Using recent
anisotropy limits from the ATCA experiment, we set new constraints on baryonic
dark matter models. Stronger constraints are imposed (in second order) upon
models with higher Hubble constant, steeper $n$, and higher density. These
limits depend on the specific ionization history assumed, but the factor gained
by lowering the ionization fraction is generally small, and may be tested by
currently-planned

We investigate the role of cosmic rays from young galaxies in heating and
ionizing the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift. Using the IRAS
observations at $60 \mu m$, we estimate the cosmic ray luminosity density at
the present epoch. We consider various forms of luminosity evolution in
redshift and calculate (a) the thresholds corresponding to the upper limits of
Gunn-Peterson optical depth, (b) the Compton $y$ parameter for an IGM heated by
cosmic rays and compare with the upper limits from COBE measurements and (c) an
estimated limit from the integral of metal enrichment. We show that certain
models, with rather strong evolution and early formation of galaxies, allow
reionization of the IGM, consistent with all known constraints.

We present explicit expressions for the calculation of cosmological look back
time, for zero cosmological constant and arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$,
which, in the limit as redshift becomes infinite, give the age of the universe.
The case for non-zero cosmological constant is most easily solved via numerical
integration. The most distant objects presently known (approaching redshift z =
5) have implied ages of $\approx$ 1-2 Gyr after the the Big Bang. The range of
such age is narrow, in spite of a variety of cosmological models one might
choose. We give a graphical representation of a variety of cosmological models
and show that a wide range of Hubble constants and values of the age and
density of the universe compatible with modern studies are consistent with
adoption of a positive cosmological constant.

Large-scale structures, observed today, are generally believed to have grown
from random, small-amplitude inhomogeneities, present in the early Universe. We
investigate how gravitational instability drives the distribution of these
fluctuations away from the initial state, assumed to be Gaussian. Using second
order perturbation theory, we calculate the skewness factor, $S_3 \equiv
\langle \delta^3 \rangle \, /\, \langle \delta^2 \rangle^2$. Here the brackets,
$\langle \ldots \rangle$, denote an ensemble average, and $\delta$ is the
density contrast field, smoothed with a low pass spatial filter. We show that
$S_3$ decreases with the slope of the fluctuation power spectrum; it depends
only weakly on $\Omega$, the cosmological density parameter. We compare
perturbative calculations with N-body experiments and find excellent agreement
over a wide dynamic range. If galaxies trace the mass, measurements of $S_3$
can be used to distinguish models with Gaussian initial conditions from their
non-Gaussian alternatives.

If massive black holes constitute the dark matter in the halo surrounding the
Milky Way, the existence of low mass globular clusters in the halo suggests an
upper limit to their mass, $M_{_{BH}}$. We use a combination of the impulse
approximation and numerical simulations to constrain $M_{_{BH}} \lsim
10^3M_\odot$, otherwise several of the halo globular clusters would be heated
to disruption within one half of their lifetime. Taken at face value, this
constraint is three orders of magnitude stronger than the previous limit
provided by disk heating arguments. However, since the initial mass function of
clusters is unknown, we argue that the real constraint is at most, an order of
magnitude weaker. Our results rule out cosmological scenarios, such as versions
of the Primordial Baryonic Isocurvature fluctuation model, which invoke the low
Jeans mass at early epochs to create a large population of black holes of mass
$\sim 10^6M_\odot$.

Recent measurements of gamma rays from the powerful quasar 3C273 by the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory show that a powerful cosmic accelerator must be
operating. In this paper the evidence for proton acceleration is collected with
the result that (i) the gamma ray spectrum should flatten slightly above a few
GeV and that (ii) high energy neutrinos from the decay of photomesons are
difficult to observe, although the power carried by these particles is as large
as the gamma ray power. However, the power is concentrated at energies in the
EeV range, whereas in the TeV-PeV range neutrinos from pp and p$\alpha$
collisions dominate due to their steeper spectrum. Consequently, the flux of
cosmic neutrinos from flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C273 in the energy
range relevant for proposed underwater or underice detectors could be much
lower than inferred from assuming the same spectrum for gamma rays and
neutrinos.

Using cosmological $N$-body simulations and the void probability function
(VPF), we investigate the statistical properties of voids within a wide range
of initially Gaussian models for the origin of large-scale structure. We pay
particular attention to the ability of the VPF to diagnose `biased galaxy
formation': the preferential formation of galaxies in regions of high
background density and corresponding suppression of galaxy formation in regions
of low background density. Biased models have systematically higher VPFs than
unbiased models, but for a given biasing scheme the VPF is relatively
insensitive to the value of the bias factor $b$. Thus, while the VPF can
distinguish unbiased models from some biased models, it is probably not a
useful way to constrain the bias factor; uncertainties in the appropriate
choice of biasing prescription overwhelm the mild dependence on $b$. We compare
the predictions of our models to the most extensive VPF observations published
to date. These data do {\it not} require strong biasing; Gaussian models in
which galaxies trace mass can reproduce the VPF data to within the errors
expected from the current finite volume fluctuations. Models with the moderate
biasing predicted by cosmological simulations with gas dynamics yield a
slightly better match to the data. Models in which galaxy formation is strongly
suppressed in low density regions produce an excess of large, empty voids.

Some bright cD galaxies in cluster cooling flows have Thomson optical depths
exceeding 0.01. A few percent of their luminosity is scattered and appears as
diffuse polarized emission. We calculate the scattering process for different
geometric combinations of luminosity sources and scattering media. We apply our
results to galaxies, with and without active nuclei, immersed in cooling flows.
We model observations of NGC 1275 and M87 (without active nuclei) in the
presence of sky and galactic background fluxes which hinder the measurement of
the scattered light at optical wavelengths. Current instruments are unable to
detect the scattered light from such objects. However, when a galaxy has an
active nucleus of roughly the same luminosity as the remainder of the galaxy in
V, both the total and polarized scattered intensity should observable on large
scales (5--30kpc), meaning intensity levels greater than 1% of the background
level. For typical AGN and galaxy spectral distributions, the scattering is
most easily detected at short (U) wavelengths. We point out that a number of
such cases will occur. We show that the radiation pattern from the central
nuclear region can be mapped using the scattering. We also show that the
scattered light can be used to measure inhomogeneities in the cooling flow.

Nearby starburst galaxies have consistently shown anomalous Ly-alpha/H-beta
ratios. By re-analysing the published IUE/optical observations, we show that
most starbursts present a normal Ly-alpha emission, consistent with case B
recombination theory, provided extinction laws appropriate to their
metallicities are used. This implies that extinction is more important than
multiple resonant scattering effects. The anomalous emission and absorption
lines present in a few remaining galaxies are simply explained if they are
observed in the post-burst phase, between about 10$^7$ and 10$^8$ yrs after the
start of the burst. We use updated stellar population synthesis models to show
that anomalous ratios are produced by the aging of stellar populations, since
the underlying stellar Ly-alpha line is important in the cooler massive stars.
The inferred low-duty cycle of massive star formation accounts naturally for
the failure to detect large numbers of Ly-alpha--emitting galaxies in deep
surveys and at high redshift. Some testable predictions of the proposed
scenario are also discussed.

We present a new method for extracting the true 3-d velocity and density
fields from the nonlinear redshift--space projected density field. The method
is based on the nonlinear, nonlocal transformation of the density field. We
assume a curl--free velocity field, although in the formulation presented here
this assumption can be dropped. Toy models with special symmetry are used to
test the intrinsic accuracy of the method compared to linear theory.
  Finding significant improvement we then test the method in more detail on
N--body simulations, considering the problems associated with sampling the
density field using sparse, magnitude--limited galaxy redshift surveys.
  A method of estimating the magnitude of shot--noise effects on the
deprojected velocity field is derived.
  We find there is a good correlation between the true and deprojected density
and velocity fields, even in the mildly nonlinear regime, provided that on
large scales galaxies trace the mass. An initial application is made to the
IRAS--QDOT all--sky redshift survey.

We have analyzed the 241 bursts for which peak counts $\C$ exist in the
publicly available Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalog.
Introducing peak counts in 1024 ms as a measure of burst brightness $\B$ and
the ratio of peak counts in 64 and 1024 ms as a measure of short timescale
variability $\V$, we find a statistically significant correlation between the
brightness and the short timescale variability of \g-ray bursts. The bursts
which are smoother on short timescales are both faint and bright, while the
bursts which are variable on short timescales are faint only, suggesting the
existence of two distinct morphological classes of bursts.

We have selected an all--sky sample of 893 galaxies from the IRAS FSC--2,
defined by a total (ADDSCAN) 12um flux limit of 0.22~Jy. Completeness is
verified to 0.30~Jy, below which we have quantified the incompleteness down to
0.22~Jy for our statistical analysis. \P The Seyfert subsample is the largest
unbiased sample of (118) Seyfert galaxies ever assembled and is complete not
only to 0.30~Jy at 12um, but also with respect to a bolometric flux limit of
$\sim2.0\times10^{-10}$~(cgs). The average $V/V_{max}$ for the full sample,
corrected for incompleteness at low fluxes, is $0.51\pm0.04$, while that for
Seyferts is $0.46\pm0.10$, suggesting that several Seyferts are yet to be
identified in our sample. The AGN luminosity functions (LFs) are more complete
than those of the optically selected CfA Seyfert galaxies for all luminosities
and AGN types. \P The 60um LF for a complete 60um--flux--limited (at 8.3~Jy)
subsample of 235 galaxies is in satisfactory agreement with those derived from
the bright galaxy sample (BGS) and the deep high--galactic latitude sample,
both selected at 60um. Over the high lum. range where our sample and the BGS
overlap, however, our space densities are systematically lower by a factor of
$\sim 1.5$, whereas at low lum. our space densities are higher by about the
same amount. Comparable results are obtained when comparing the far--IR LF of
our entire sample with the one derived from the BGS. This is not unexpected,
because of the bias towards high-luminosity spirals caused by selection at
60um.

This review concentrates almost entirely on globular star clusters. It
emphasises the increasing realisation that few of the traditional problems of
star cluster astronomy can be studied in isolation: the influence of the Galaxy
affects dynamical evolution deep in the core, and the spectrum of stellar
masses; in turn the evolution of the core determines the highest stellar
densities, and the rate of encounters. In this way external tidal effects
indirectly influence the formation and evolution of blue stragglers, binary
pulsars, X-ray sources, etc. More controversially, the stellar density appears
to influence the relative distribution of normal stars. In the opposite sense,
the evolution of individual stars governs much of the early dynamics of a
globular cluster, and the existence of large numbers of primordial binary stars
has changed important details of our picture of the dynamical evolution. New
computational tools which will become available in the next few years will help
dynamical theorists to address these questions.

Highly dynamic magnetospheric perturbations in neutron star environments can
naturally account for the features observed in Gamma-ray Burst spectra. The
source distribution, however, appears to be extragalactic. Although
noncatastrophic isotropic emission mechanisms may be ruled out on energetic and
timing arguments, MHD processes can produce strongly anisotropic gamma-rays
with an observable flux out to distances of around 1-2 Gpc. Here we show that
sheared Alfven waves propagating along open magnetospheric field lines at the
poles of magnetized neutron stars transfer their energy dissipationally to the
current sustaining the field misalignment and thereby focus their power into a
spatial region around 1000 times smaller than that of the crustal disturbance.
This produces a strong (observable) flux enhancement along certain directions.
We apply this model to a source population of ``turned-off'' pulsars that have
nonetheless retained their strong magnetic fields and have achieved alignment
at a period of greater than 5 seconds.

We analyze the consequences of models of structure formation for higher-order
($n$-point) galaxy correlation functions in the mildly non-linear regime.
Several variations of the standard $\Omega=1$ cold dark matter model with
scale-invariant primordial perturbations have recently been introduced to
obtain more power on large scales, 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, e.g., low-matter-density
(non-zero cosmological constant) models, `tilted' primordial spectra, and
scenarios with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter. They also include models
with an effective scale-dependent bias, such as the cooperative galaxy
formation scenario of Bower, etal. (1993). We show that higher-order galaxy
correlation functions can provide a useful test of such models and can
discriminate between models with true large-scale power in the density field
and those where the galaxy power arises from scale-dependent bias: a bias with
rapid scale-dependence leads to a dramatic decrease of the hierarchical
amplitudes at large scales. Current observational constraints on the
three-point amplitudes $Q_3$ and $S_3$ can place limits on the bias
parameter(s) and appear to disfavor, but not yet rule out, the hypothesis that
scale-dependent bias is responsible for the extra power observed on large
scales.

A perturber may excite a coherent mode in a star cluster or galaxy. If the
stellar system is stable, it is commonly assumed that such a mode will be
strongly damped and therefore of little practical consequence other than
redistributing momentum and energy deposited by the perturber. This paper
demonstrates that this assumption is false; weakly damped modes exist and may
persist long enough to have observable consequences. To do this, a method for
investigating the dispersion relation for spherical stellar systems and for
locating weakly damped modes in particular is developed and applied to King
models of varying concentration. This leads to the following remarkable result:
King models exhibit {\it very} weakly damped $m=1$ modes over a wide range of
concentration ($0.67\le c\le1.5$ have been examined). The predicted damping
time is tens to hundreds of crossing times. This mode causes the peak density
to shift from and slowly revolve about the initial center. The existence of the
mode is supported by n-body simulation. Higher order modes and possible
astronomical consequences are discussed. Weakly damped modes, for example, may
provide a natural explanation for observed discrepancies between density and
kinematic centers in galaxies, the location of velocity cusps due to massive
black holes, and $m=1$ disturbances of disks embedded in massive halos.
Gravitational shocking may excite the $m=1$ mode in globular clusters, which
could modify their subsequent evolution and displace the positions of exotic
remnants.

A model is presented in which supernova-driven winds from early galaxies
reionize the intergalactic medium by z=5. This scenario can explain the
observed absence of a Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectra of high-redshift
quasars providing that the bulk of these early galaxies are quite small, no
more massive than about 10^8 solar masses. It also predicts that most of the
IGM was enriched to at least 10% of current metal content by z=5 and perhaps as
early as z=15. The existence of such early mini-galaxies violates no spectral
constraints and is consistent with a pure CDM model with b<2. Since the final
radius of a typical ionized bubble is only around 100 kpc, the induced
modification of the galaxy autocorrelation function is negligible, as is the
induced angular smoothing of the CMBR. Some of the gas swept up by shells may
be observable as pressure-supported Lyman-alpha forest clouds.

We model farinfrared (FIR) spectra of radioweak quasars with the assumption
that the emission is from heated dust, and that the heating is due to the
central engine via energetic particles. These energetic particles are diffusing
from a postulated source near the central engine through a tenuous galactic
halo to arrive at the dust which is taken to be in molecular clouds in a disk
configuration. This picture does not depend on a particular geometry of the
disk such as warps. This concept can readily reproduce the range of observed
mm/submm/FIR/IR spectra.

In this paper we have examined the internal dynamics of the globular cluster
NGC 362. A V band surface brightness profile (SBP) was constructed from CCD
images, and, after it was determined that the cluster is not post
core-collapse, fit with single- and multi-mass King-Michie (KM) models. The
total cluster luminosity is 1.70 $\pm 0.1 \times 10^5$ L$_V$\sol. A total of
285 stellar spectra were obtained of 215 stars for radial velocity
determinations. Four stars showed strong evidence for radial velocity
variations and are probably members of binary systems. The true cluster binary
fraction was determined from simulations to be 0.15 for circular orbits or 0.27
for orbits with a distribution function $f(e) = e$ ($e$ is eccentricity). This
relatively high binary detection frequency may indicate that NGC 362 is
overabundant in binaries compared to other clusters. The 208 remaining stars
showed no sign of rotation. The best agreement with both the kinematic data and
the SBP were for shallow mass functions $x = 0.0 - 0.5$ and intermediate
amounts of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor. The cluster mass is M
= $2.5 - 3.5 \times 10^5$ M\sol\ for a global mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_V$ =
1.5 - 2.0 M\sol/L$_V$\sol. This low value for $x$ is in disagreement with the
correlation between $x$ and the height above the Galactic disk seen for a
sample of other clusters. The results are also different from the sharp turn-up
in the low mass end of mass functions derived from some deep luminosity
functions of three other globular clusters.

(substantial changes to section 3.2, otherwise minor) We present an analysis
of the hydrodynamic stability of a cold slab bounded by two accretion shocks.
Previous numerical work has shown that when the Mach number of the shock is
large the slab is unstable. Here we show that to linear order both the bending
and breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will
tend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab
displacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear
instability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for
small bending angles, is $\sim c_sk (k\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\eta$ is the slab
displacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local
vorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss
the implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs.
Finally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock
and a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case
is stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a
nonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock
bounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce
substructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the
sound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab
thickness.

The presence of protostellar disks can greatly increase the dissipation
during close stellar encounters, leading to the formation of a significant
population of binaries during the initial collapse and virialization of a
cluster. We have used N-body simulations of collapsing globular clusters to
find the major factors that determine the efficiency of binary formation
through star-disk captures. This work serves the dual purpose of verifying the
results of earlier analytic work as well as examining parameters not testable
by that work. As in the earlier work, typical binary fractions of a few percent
are found. For the parameters studied, the results are found to depend
remarkably little upon disk evolution, the mass distribution of the stars, or
their spatial distribution, though distributions in which the stars are highly
clumped yield binary fractions larger by a factor of a few. The direct N-body
integrations limit the models to relatively small values of N. Semiempirical
relations are derived, however, which allow the results to be extrapolated to
values of N appropriate to globular clusters.

Gravitational collapse of the cylindrical elongated cloud is studied by
numerical magnetohydrodynamical simulations. In the infinitely long cloud in
hydrostatic configuration, small perturbations grow by the gravitational
instability. The most unstable mode indicated by a linear perturbation theory
grows selectively even from a white noise. The growth rate agrees with that
calculated by the linear theory. First, the density-enhanced region has an
elongated shape, i.e., prolate spheroidal shape. As the collapse proceeds, the
high-density fragment begins to contract mainly along the symmetry axis.
Finally, a spherical core is formed in the non-magnetized cloud. In contrast,
an oblate spheroidal dense disk is formed in a cloud in which the magnetic
pressure is nearly equal to the thermal one. The radial size of the disk
becomes proportional to the initial characteristic density scale-height in the
r-direction. As the collapse proceeds, a slowly contracting dense part is
formed (approximately < 10% in mass) inside of the fast contracting disk. And
this is separated from other part of the disk whose inflow velocity is
accelerated as reaching the center of the core. From arguments on the Jeans
mass and the magnetic critical mass, it is concluded that the fragments formed
in a cylindrical elongated cloud can not be supported against the self- gravity
and it will eventually collapse.

We present analyses of the two-point correlation function derived from an
all-sky redshift survey of 5313 galaxies extracted from the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) database. The redshift space correlation function
\xi(s) is well described by a power law, $\xi(s) = (s/4.53h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc})^{-1.28}$, on scales \simlt 20\mpc; on larger scales \xi(s) drops below
the extension of this power law. We examine the effect of redshift space
distortions on the correlation function and compute the full two dimensional
correlation function \xi(r_p,\pi). From this, we derive the real space
correlation function, which is well described by $\xi(r) = (r/3.76h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc})^{-1.66}$ on scales \simlt 20\mpc. The derived correlation functions are
found to be consistent with previous determinations in the literature, and seem
to show more power on large scales than predicted by the standard Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) model. Comparison of the derived \xi(r) with the correlation
function of optical galaxies implies an optical to IRAS bias ratio of $b_O/b_I
= 1.38\pm 0.12$ on a scale of $\sim 8$\mpc . The variances in cubical cells
inferred from \xi(s) appear discrepant with the previously reported results of
Efstathiou et al. (1990).

We present new ground-based data following up on the HST discovery of
low-redshift Lya absorption in the sight-line to the quasar 3C273. Narrow-band
filter observations show that there are no H II regions within a 12 kpc radius
of the line-of-sight to the quasar, at the velocities of three of the
absorbers. Broad-band imaging shows that there are no dwarf galaxies at Virgo
distances with absolute magnitude above MB~-13.5 and within a radius of 40 kpc.
We present fiber spectroscopy of galaxies within a radius of 1 deg, down to an
apparent magnitude of B~19. We show that the absorbers are definitely not
distributed at random with respect to the galaxies, but also that the
absorber-galaxy correlation function is not as strong as the galaxy-galaxy
correlation function on large scales. Our data are consistent with the
hypothesis that all galaxies more luminous than 1/10 L* have effective
cross-sections (for association with absorbers with Log(NH)>13.0), of between
0.5 and 1 Mpc. We also show a clear case of a Lya absorber which has no galaxy
brighter than MB=-18 within a projected distance of 4.8 Mpc, and discuss the
possibility that Lya absorbers are destroyed in a rich galaxy environment.

We have examined the effect of the environmental density on the arm
classification of an extensive sample of spiral galaxies included in the Nearby
Galaxy Catalog (Tully, 1988a). We have also explored the dependence of the arm
class of a galaxy on other factors, such as its blue absolute magnitude and its
disk-to-total mass ratio, inferred in the literature either from the gradient
of a good galaxy rotation curve or from a photometric mass decomposition
method. We have found that the arm class is strongly related to the absolute
magnitude in the mid-type spirals (in the sense that grand design galaxies are,
on average, more luminous than flocculent objects), whilst this relation is
considerably weaker in the early and late types. In general the influence of
the local density on the arm structure appears to be much weaker than that of
the absolute magnitude. The local density acts essentially in strengthening the
arm class--absolute magnitude relation for the mid types, whereas no
environmental density effects are observed in the early and late types. Using
the most recent estimates of the disk-to-total mass ratio, we do not confirm
this ratio to be a significant factor which affects the arm class;
nevertheless, owing to poor statistics and large uncertanties, the issue
remains open. Neither a local density effect nor an unambiguous bar effect on
the disk-to-total mass ratio is detectable; the latter finding may challenge
some theoretical viewpoints on the formation of bar structures.

CBS is a new program for binary system light curve analysis, it generates
synthetic light curves for a binary system, accounting for eclipses, tidal
distortion, limb darkening, gravity darkening and reflection; it is also
possible to compute the light contribution and eclipses of an accretion disk.
The bolometric light curve is generated, as well as curves for the U,B,V,R,I
colour bands. In the following we give a brief description of the first version
of the program and show some preliminary results.

3C275.1 and \NGC4651 make a particularly interesting quasar/galaxy pairing
because of the alignment of such a strong radio emitter behind the outer H\I
disk of a relatively undisturbed spiral galaxy. This provides an opportunity to
study the spin-temperature characteristics of atomic hydrogen at low column
densities, in an apparently star-free environment. We previously reported a
tentative detection of absorption against the quasar based on VLA C--array
observations; we have now made more sensitive maps of the H\I emission from
\NGC4651 with the VLA D--array, and we have attempted to confirm the weak H\I
absorption against the quasar at higher spatial and spectral resolution in VLA
B--array. The possible absorption feature against this quasar appears to be
weaker than we previously suspected, even though it seems fairly clear that H\I
emission is present close to the line of sight to the quasar.The weakness of
the possible absorption seems also to confirm, conversely, the trend found in
previous observations that where strong absorption lines are seen, the galaxies
show evidence of disturbance. The possible detection of (or limits on)
absorption suggest that the neutral gas in the outer disk is quite warm. We use
the absorption and emission measurements to set lower limits on the combination
of heating inputs outside the star-forming regions of a disk galaxy and/or the
intensity of the cosmic background radiation around 100 eV.

ABSRACT:We show how to use 21-cm emission and absorption studies to estimate
the heat inputs to the neutral gas in low pressure environments, such as in
outer disks of spiral galaxies, in galactic halos or in intergalactic space.
For a range of model parameters we calculate the gas kinetic and spin
temperatures ($T_K$ and $T_S$) and the relation between $T_S$ and the heat
input to the gas. We outline the conditions for a ``two phase medium'' to
exist. We find that although $T_S$ can be much smaller than $T_K$, $T_S$ is
always $ \gg 3$ K for column densities greater that $5 \times 10^{18}$
cm$^{-2}$. This excludes the possibility that relevant HI masses at the
periphery of galaxies are invisible at 21-cm in emission. The outermost
interstellar gas in a disk galaxy is more directly affected by external
processes and in this paper we estimate the intensity of the extragalactic
background at energies close to 0.1 keV by comparing our theoretical results
with HI emission/absorption studies. We take into account the possibility that
some energy produced in the inner regions affects the energy balance in outer
regions. We find that in the absence of any other local heat source QSO
dominated background models are still compatible with the spin temperature
limits derived for the two best documented HI emission/absorption studies in
outer regions.

Observations indicate that some extended outer disks have a sharp cut off in
the surface density of neutral hydrogen when this approaches the value of $\sim
2\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this paper we model these HI edges as places
where the ratio of neutral to ionized hydrogen drops rapidly due to ionizing
radiation. We use two different models for the vertical distribution of gas
above the outer galactic plane: in the first model we derive the density from
the ideal gas law while in the second model we insert a macroscopic pressure
term and derive the density as for an isothermal slab. We consider two
different sources of ionizing photons: external fluxes of different intensity
and spectral index due to quasars, and a monochromatic UV flux due to neutrino
decays. We find that galaxies which have a smaller gas scale height should show
outer HI disks to a lower column density and smoother HI edges. The sharpness
of the HI-HII transition and the total column density at which the medium is
50$\%$ ionized, are strongly correlated. We present several model fits to the
HI sharp edge observed in M33. If today's UV background is dominated by
attenuated quasar light, which gives $\sim 10^{-14}$ H ionizations s$^{-1}$, a
large gas scale height or equivalently a nearly spherical halo is preferred. If
ionizing photons from decaying neutrinos are responsible for the sharp edge, a
flat dark matter halo, is required.

Extremely high velocity (EHV) wings, with full widths of 72 to 140 km/s, are
seen on the CO J=3-2 lines toward W3 IRS 5, GL 490, NGC 2071, W28 A2, GL 2591,
S140, and Cepheus A.
  The results of our survey suggest that EHV wings are common around infrared
sources of moderate to high luminosity (500 to 4x10^5 Lsun) in dense regions.
Line ratios imply that the EHV gas is usually optically thin and warm.
Characteristic velocities range from 20 to 40 km/s, yielding timescales of
1600-4200 yr. Since most sources in this study are producing some ionizing
photons, these short timescales suggest that neutral winds coexist with
ionizing photons.
  We examined two possible sources for the EHV CO emission: a neutral stellar
wind; and swept-up or entrained molecular gas. Neither can be ruled out. If the
high-velocity (HV) gas is swept up by a momentum-conserving stellar wind traced
by the extremely high velocity CO emission, most of the C in the winds from
luminous objects cannot be in CO. If the EHV and HV forces are equal, the
fraction of C in a form other than CO increases with source luminosity and with
the production rate of ionizing photons.

We present a solution for the relative positions and orientations of the four
CCD chips on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Planetary Camera (PC). An
accurate solution is required when matching HST images with ground-based images
or with one another. The solution is accurate to about 1/4 PC pixel or about
$0{.\hskip-2pt ''} 01$, a 30-fold improvement over the best previous solution.
The CCDs are rotated relative to one another by up to $1^\circ$. The solution
is based on images taken between December 1990 and June 1992 and is stable over
that entire period. We find that the pixel size is $0{.\hskip-2pt ''}04373\pm
0{.\hskip-2pt ''}00004$ based on comparison with HST Guide Stars, in good
agreement with previous Guide-Star based calibrations but $\sim 1\%$ smaller
than a globular-cluster based calibration.

Physics beyond the simplest version of the standard electroweak model is
required to reconcile the results of the chlorine and the Kamiokande solar
neutrino experiments. None of the 1000 solar models in a full Monte Carlo
simulation is consistent with the results of the chlorine or the Kamiokande
experiments. Even if the solar models are forced articficially to have a ${}^8
B$ neutrino flux in agreement with the Kamiokande experiment, none of the
fudged models agrees with the chlorine observations. This comparison shows that
consistency of the chlorine and Kamiokande experiments requires some physical
process that changes the shape of the ${}^8 B$ neutrino energy spectrum. The
GALLEX and SAGE experiments, which currently have large statistical
uncertainties, differ from the predictions of the standard solar model by $2
\sigma$ and $3 \sigma$, respectively. The possibility that the neutrino
experiments are incorrect is briefly discussed.

We investigate the angular distribution of the $\gamma$-ray bursts in the
publicly available BATSE catalogue, using the measures of burst brightness $B$
and short time scale ($\simless$ 0.3 s) variability $V$ which we introduced
earlier. We show that the 54 type I ($\log V \le -0.8$) bursts lying in the
middle brightness range 490 counts $\le B \le$ 1250 counts (corresponding to
1/3 of all type I bursts) exhibit a Galactic dipole moment of $\langle \cos
\theta \rangle = 0.204 \pm 0.079$ {\it and} a deviation of the Galactic
quadrupole moment from 1/3 of $\langle \sin^2 b \rangle - 1/3 = -0.104 \pm
0.041$. Using Monte Carlo simulations which include the BATSE sky exposure map
and taking into account division of the type I bursts into three equal samples,
we find that the probability by chance of an isotropic distribution of 54
bursts exhibiting values of $\langle \cos \theta \rangle$ {\it and} the
negative of $\langle \sin^2 b \rangle - 1/3$ which equal or exceed the observed
values is $6.6 \times 10^{-5}$. We conclude that $\gamma$-ray bursts are
Galactic in origin.

We investigate clustering in the angular distribution of the 260 $\gamma$-ray
bursts in the publicly available BATSE catalogue, using a nearest neighbour
analysis and the measures of burst brightness $B$ and short time scale
variability $V$ which we introduced earlier. We find that while all 260 bursts
are only modestly clustered (Q-value = $1.8 \times 10^{-2}$), the 202 bursts in
this sample for which the statistical error in their locations is $<9^\circ$
are significantly clustered on an angular scale $\approx 5^\circ$ (Q-value =
$2.5 \times 10^{-4}$, taking into acoount having chosen the cutoff in the
statistical error). We also find a significant correlation between bright type
I bursts and faint type I and type II bursts on an angular scale $\approx
5^\circ$ (Q-value = $4.0 \times 10^{-3}$). This angular scale is smaller than
the typical (statistical plus systematic) error in burst locations of
$6.8^\circ$, suggesting multiple recurrences from individual sources. We
conclude that ``classical'' $\gamma$-ray burst sources repeat on a time scale
of months, and that many faint type I and II bursts come from the sources of
bright type I bursts.

Early photoionization of the intergalactic medium is discussed in a nearly
model-independent way, in order to investigate whether early structures
corresponding to rare Gaussian peaks in a CDM model can photoionize the
intergalactic medium sufficiently early to appreciably smooth out the microwave
background fluctuations. We conclude that this is indeed possible for a broad
range of CDM normalizations and is almost inevitable for unbiased CDM, provided
that the bulk of these early structures are quite small, no more massive than
about 10^8 solar masses. Typical parameter values predict that reionization
occurs around z=50, thereby suppressing fluctuations on degree scales while
leaving the larger angular scales probed by COBE reasonably unaffected.
However, for non-standard CDM, incorporating mixed dark matter, vacuum density
or a tilted primordial power spectrum, early reionization plays no significant
role.

One still cannot conclusively assert that the universe underwent a neutral
phase, despite the new COBE FIRAS limit y<0.000025 on Compton y-distortions of
the cosmic microwave background. Although scenarios where the very early
(z=1000) ionization is thermal, caused by IGM temperatures exceeding 10000K,
are clearly ruled out, there is a significant loophole for cosmologies with
typical CDM parameters if the dominant ionization mechanism is photoionization.
If the ionizing radiation has a typical quasar spectrum, then the y-constraint
implies roughly h^{3/2}\Omega_b Omega_0^{-1/4}<0.1 for fully ionized models.
This means that BDM models with Omega_0 around 0.15 and reionization at about
z=1000 are strongly constrained even in this very conservative case, and can
survive the y test only if most of the baryons form BDM around the reionization
epoch.

The majority of this paper is devoted to discrete radio sources, and their
consequences for cosmology. Three main issues are considered: (i) what makes a
galaxy radio loud?; (ii) what do we know about how the population of radio-loud
galaxies has changed with epoch?; and (iii) what can observations of
high-redshift radio galaxies tell us about general questions of galaxy
formation and evolution? The main conclusion is that radio galaxies are
remarkably ordinary massive ellipticals. The high-redshift examples are
generally old and red and do not make good candidates for primaeval galaxies.

We present new magnitudes derived from 1.65 micron images for 23 galaxies in
the Ursa Major cluster. Magnitudes now exist for all but one spiral meeting our
criteria for cluster membership and having HI velocity width greater than 187
km/s and inclination greater than 45 deg. These spirals fit a Tully-Fisher
relation with dispersion in intrinsic magnitudes (after known observational
uncertainties and the effect of cluster depth are removed) of 0.36 and a slope
of 10.2 +/- 0.6. The magnitude dispersion is smaller than found in the Virgo
cluster but still significantly larger than claimed by some authors. We find a
hint that the Tully-Fisher relation may turn over at the bright end. Adding the
central surface brightness of the disk as a third parameter flattens the slope
of the Tully- Fisher relation and may give a distance estimate with slightly
less dispersion, but the significance of the decrease must be tested on an
independent sample.

We present results from a large area (552\,\sqamin) imaging $K$-band survey
to a 5$\sigma$ limit of $K\simeq 17.3$. We have optical-infrared colours of
almost all the objects in the sample. Star-galaxy discrimination is performed
and the results used to derive the infrared star and galaxy counts. $K$-band
``no-evolution'' galaxy-count models are constructed and compared with the
observed data. In the infrared, there is no counterpart for the large excess of
faint galaxies over the no-evolution model seen in optical counts. However, we
show that the $K$ counts can be remarkably insensitive to evolution under
certain reasonable assumptions. Finally, model predictions for $K$-selected
redshift surveys are derived.

The mass formulae for finite lumps of strange quark matter with $u$, $d$ and
$s$ quarks, and non-strange quark matter consisting of $u$ and $d$ quarks are
derived in a non-relativistic potential model. The finite-size effects
comprising the surface, curvature and even, the Gauss curvature were
consistently obtained, which shows a converging trend. It is found that there
is a possibility for the formation of metastable strangelets of large mass. The
model predicts low charge to mass ratio as the characteristic signature of
strange matter in agreement with the relativistic studies. This study also
yields an independent estimate for the bag energy density $B$, which is in
agreement with the M.I.T bag model value.

The rapid time variability of gamma-ray bursts implies the sources are very
compact, and the peak luminosities are so high that some matter must be ejected
at ultra-relativistic speeds. The very large Lorentz factors of the bulk flow
are also indicated by the very broad and hard spectra. It is natural to expect
that when the relativistic ejecta interact with the interstellar matter a
strong synchrotron radio emission is generated, as is the case with supernova
remnants and radio galaxies. We estimate that the strongest gamma-ray bursts
may be followed by radio transients with peak fluxes as high as 0.1 Jy. The
time of peak radio emission depends on the distance scale; it is less than a
minute if the bursts are in the galactic halo, and about a week if the bursts
are at cosmological distances.

Model surface brightness profiles based on Fokker-Planck simulations have
been used to assess the high resolution surface brightness profile of the
globular cluster NGC 6397 of Lauzeral et al. (1992). The profile is well fitted
by the model in the maximum-expansion phase of a gravothermal oscillation with
a core radius of 0.06 pc (6''), but an unresolved core cannot be ruled out. A
core this size is also expected in highly evolved clusters including
significant numbers of primordial binaries. A more massive cluster will provide
better statistics, as would star counts. The greater distance of the other
globular clusters and the requirements of star counting will demand very high
resolution observations to definitively resolve cores this size.

We discuss in detail the effect of neutrino oscillations in Big Bang
nucleosynthesis, between active and sterile neutrinos, as well as between
active and active neutrinos. We calculate the constraints on mixings between
active and sterile neutrinos from the present observation of the primordial
helium abundance and discuss the potential implications on various
astrophysical and cosmological problems of such oscillations. In particular, we
show that large angle sterile neutrino mixing seems to be excluded as a MSW
solution to the solar neutrino situation or a solution to the atmospheric
neutrino mixing hinted at in some underground experiments. We show how with
this constraint, the next generation of solar neutrino experiments should be
able to determine the resolution of the solar neutrino problem. It is also
shown how sterile neutrinos remain a viable dark matter candidate.

We have applied a new restoration technique to archival [O~I], H$\alpha$, and
continuum HST images of DG~Tau. The restored [O~I] and H$\alpha$ images show
that DG~Tau has a jet with a projected length of 25~AU and width $\leq$10~AU,
and is already collimated at a projected distance of $\sim$~40~AU (0\farcs25)
from the star. Such a narrow width and short collimation distance for a stellar
jet places important constraints on theoretical models of jet formation.

We adopt a new approach to explore the puzzling nature of faint blue field
galaxies. Instead of assuming that the local luminosity function is well
defined, we first determine whether any non-evolving set of luminosity
functions for different spectral types of galaxies is compatible with the
observed marginal distributions in optical and near-infrared counts, B - R
colors, and redshifts. Exploiting a non-negative least squares method, we
derive a new no-evolution model that is found to fit all the observations
surprisingly well. We conclude that models more exotic than mild luminosity
evolution, such as those requiring rapid evolution in star formation rates,
disappearing dwarf galaxy populations, high values of the cosmological
constant, rapid mergers, or substantial non-conservation of galaxy numbers with
time, are no longer as compelling.

We discuss the fragmentation of a filamentary cloud on the basis of a
1-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a self-gravitating gas cloud. The
simulation shows that dense cores are produced with a semi-regular interval in
space and time from one edge to the other. At the initial stage the gas near
one of the edges is attracted inwards by gravity and the accumulation of the
gas makes a dense core near the edge. When the dense core grows in mass up to a
certain amount, it gathers gas from the other direction. Accordingly the dense
core becomes isolated from the main cloud and the parent filamentary cloud has
a new edge. This cycle repeats and the fragmentation process propagates towards
the other edge. The propagation speed is a few tens of percent larger than the
sound speed. According to the theory, the age difference for the northwest-most
and southeast-most cores in TMC-1 is estimated to be 0.68~pc/0.6~km~s$^{-1}$ =
$ 10 ^6 $~y. The estimated age difference is consistent with that obtained from
the chemical chronology.

We present a new analytic study of the equilibrium and stability properties
of close binary systems containing polytropic components. Our method is based
on the use of ellipsoidal trial functions in an energy variational principle.
We consider both synchronized and nonsynchronized systems, constructing the
compressible generalizations of the classical Darwin and Darwin-Riemann
configurations. Our method can be applied to a wide variety of binary models
where the stellar masses, radii, spins, entropies, and polytropic indices are
all allowed to vary over wide ranges and independently for each component. We
find that both secular and dynamical instabilities can develop before a Roche
limit or contact is reached along a sequence of models with decreasing binary
separation. High incompressibility always makes a given binary system more
susceptible to these instabilities, but the dependence on the mass ratio is
more complicated. As simple applications, we construct models of double
degenerate systems and of low-mass main-sequence-star binaries. We also discuss
the orbital evolution of close binary systems under the combined influence of
fluid viscosity and secular angular momentum losses from processes like
gravitational radiation. We show that the existence of global fluid
instabilities can have a profound effect on the terminal evolution of
coalescing binaries. The validity of our analytic solutions is examined by
means of detailed comparisons with the results of recent numerical fluid
calculations in three dimensions.

We investigate the evolution of interfaces among phases of the interstellar
medium with different temperature. It is found that, for some initial
conditions, the dynamical effects related to conductive fronts are very
important even if radiation losses, which tend to decelerate the front
propagation, are taken into account. We have also explored the consequences of
the inclusion of shear and bulk viscosity, and we have allowed for saturation
of the kinetic effects. Numerical simulations of a cloud immersed in a hot
medium have been performed; depending on the ratio of conductive to dynamical
time, the density is increased by a huge factor and the cloud may become
optically thick. Clouds that are highly compressed are able to stop the
evaporation process even if their initial size is smaller than the Field
length. In addition to the numerical approach, the time dependent evolution has
been studied also analytically. Simple techniques have been applied to the
problem in order to study the transition stages to a stationary state. The
global properties of the solution for static and steady fronts and useful
relations among the various physical variables are derived; a mechanical
analogy is often used to clarify the physics of the results. It is demonstrated
that a class of soliton-like solutions are admitted by the hydrodynamical
equations appropriate to describe the conduction/cooling fronts (in the
inviscid case) that do not require a heat flux at the boundaries. Some
astrophysical consequences are indicated along with some possible applications
to the structure of the Galactic ISM and to extragalactic objects.

We present a study of the ionization and thermal structure of neutral
hydrogen clouds located in the Galactic halo, immersed in the extragalactic
background radiation field, and supposed to be in pressure equilibrium with the
surrounding (presumably) hot medium. The problem is solved numerically, but an
useful analytical approximation has been derived as well. We discuss the two
main parameters of the problem, \ie the radiation field and the halo pressure,
in the framework of the current models for the halo/disk interaction. We find a
well defined relation between a critical column density at which the cloud
starts to develop a cold central core with the cloud linear size. Making use of
this relation, we suggest a straightforward method to derive the distance to
the cloud. We discuss the possible sources of error in this determination and
it is found that the method is particularly suitable for those clouds which are
subsonic with respect to the surrounding medium, while for the supersonic ones,
the method can only give a lower limit to the distance. The H$\alpha$ emission
from the partially ionized edge of the cloud is calculated and compared with
the available observations; this measure is a powerful indicator of the
possible presence of a shock in the cloud.

We recover the one-point probability distribution function of the {\it
initial} density fluctuations (\ipdf) from the quasi-linear galaxy density
field of the 1.2 Jy \iras\ redshift survey smoothed by $10\hmpc$. The recovery,
using the laminar, Eulerian, Zel'dovich approximation of Nusser and Dekel, is
independent of $\Omega$ and is relatively insensitive to linear galaxy biasing
in the range $0.5 \leq b \leq 2$. Errors due to discrete sampling, the limited
survey volume, and the method of recovering the \ipdf\ are evaluated by
comparing the \ipdf\ determined from the \iras\ data with Monte-Carlo
\iras-like catalogs ``observed" from $N$-body simulations of CDM models with
Gaussian initial conditions. Eight sensitive statistical tests used in this
comparison find the \iras\ \ipdf\ to be consistent with Gaussian. We provide
observational constraints on possible deviations from Gaussianity, which should
be obeyed by any theoretical model.

If gamma-ray bursts originate at cosmological distances then their angular
distribution should exhibit a dipole in the direction of the solar motion
relative to the cosmic microwave background. This is due to the combined
effects of abberation, an anisotropic shift of the burst event rate, and an
angular variation in the distance out to which bursts can be detected.
  We derive the amplitude of the expected dipole for an open and flat
cosmological model, and for various possible evolution rates of the burst
population. Although our dimensionless velocity with respect to the CMB rest
frame is of order $10^{-3}$, the dipole amplitude is of order $10^{-2}$, an
order of magnitude larger. The results depend very weakly on the value of
$\Omega_0$, but are sensitive to the spectral index of the bursts' photon
spectra, and to the rate of evolution of the burst population. There is no
dependence on the value of the Hubble constant.
  A clear detection of the dipole will require a larger sample of bursts than
currently available (of order $10^4$). Future statistical analyses of the
hypothesis that bursts originate at cosmological distances should take this
effect into account, rather than assuming a perfectly isotropic distribution,
for obtaining the correct statistical significance of their results.

We analyze stability conditions of "Maclaurin flows" (self-gravitating,
barotropic, two dimensional, stationary streams moving in closed loops around a
point) by minimizing their energy, subject to fixing all the constants of the
motion including mass and circulations. Necessary and sufficient conditions of
stability are obtained when gyroscopic terms in the perturbed Lagrangian are
zero. To illustrate and check the properties of this new energy principle, we
have calculated the stability limits of an ordinary Maclaurin disk whose
dynamical stability limits are known. Perturbations are in the plane of the
disk. We find all necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for single
mode symmetrical or antisymmetrical perturbations. The limits of stability are
identical with those given by a dynamical analysis. Regarding mixed types of
perturbations the maximally constrained energy principle give for some the
necessary and sufficient condition of stability, for others only sufficient
conditions of stability. The application of the new energy principle to
Maclaurin disks shows the method to be as powerful as the method of dynamical
perturbations.

We discuss the non--linear growth of the excess kurtosis parameter of the
smoothed density fluctuation field $\delta$,
$S_4\equiv[\lan\delta^{\,4}\ran-3\lan\delta^{\,2}\ran^2]/
\lan\delta^{\,2}\ran^3$ in an Einstein--de Sitter universe. We assume Gaussian
primordial density fluctuations with scale--free power spectrum $P(k)\propto
k^{\,n}$ and analyze the dependence of $S_4$ on primordial spectral index $n$,
after smoothing with a Gaussian filter. As already known for the skewness ratio
$S_3$, the kurtosis parameter is a {\it decreasing function} of $n$, both in
exact perturbative theory and in the Zel'dovich approximation. The parameter
$S_4$ provides a powerful statistics to test different cosmological scenarios.

The peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the pattern of galaxy clustering
in redshift space, making the redshift space power spectrum anisotropic. In the
linear regime, the strength of this distortion depends only on the ratio $\beta
\equiv f(\Omega)/b \approx \Omega^{0.6}/b$, where $\Omega$ is the cosmological
density parameter and $b$ is the bias parameter. We derive a linear theory
estimator for $\beta$ based on the harmonic moments of the redshift space power
spectrum. Using N-body simulations, we examine the impact of non-linear
gravitational clustering on the power spectrum anisotropy and on our
$\beta$-estimator. Non-linear effects can be important out to wavelengths
$\lambda \sim 50$Mpc/h or larger; in most cases, they lower the quadrupole
moment of the power spectrum and thereby depress the estimate of $\beta$ below
the true value. With a sufficiently large redshift survey, the scaling of
non-linear effects may allow separate determinations of $\Omega$ and $b$.
  We describe a practical technique for measuring the anisotropy of the power
spectrum from galaxy redshift surveys, and we test the technique on mock
catalogues drawn from the N-body simulations. Preliminary application of our
methods to the 1.2 Jy IRAS galaxy survey yields $\beta_{est} \sim 0.3-0.4 $ at
wavelengths $\lambda \sim 30-40$Mpc/h . Non-linear effects remain important at
these scales, so this estimate of $\beta$ is probably lower than the true
value.

Flat and open universe models are considered, containing a mixture of cold
matter (dust) and radiation interacting only through gravity, with the aim of
studying their stability with respect to linear scalar perturbations. To this
end the perturbed universe is considered as a dynamical system, described by
coupled differential equations for a gauge\hs invariant perturbation variable
and a relevant background variable. The phase\hs space analysis of this
dynamical system shows that flat dust\hs radiation models are unstable, and
open models structurally unstable, with respect to adiabatic perturbations. It
is shown that there are perturbations which decay even if their wavelength at
equidensity is larger than the corresponding Jeans scale. Metric and curvature
perturbations are also briefly discussed. We believe that this analysis gives a
clearer idea of the stability properties of realistic universe models than the
standard one based on the Jeans scale, despite our simplifying assumptions.

In this paper we discuss four early F-type variable stars whose periods are
an order of magnitude slower than known pulsators of comparable luminosity.
They cannot be stars undergoing simple radial pulsations. For one or more of
these stars we can discount the possibility that the variability is due to
rotational modulation of star spots, interactions with (or tidal distortions
by) a close companion, or obscuration by a rotating lumpy ring of dust orbiting
the star. They are certainly not eclipsing binaries. The only possibility left
seems to be non-radial pulsations, though this explanation involves
difficulties of its own. If they are indeed pulsating stars exhibiting non-
radial gravity modes, they would be the first stars on the cool side of the
Cepheid instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to be so
identified.

This paper presents a general-relativistic N-body technique for evolving the
phase space distribution of massive neutrinos in linear perturbation theory.
The method provides a much more accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space
for the HDM initial conditions of N-body simulations in a cold+hot dark matter
universe than previous work. Instead of directly sampling the phase space at
the end of the linear era, we first compute the evolution of the metric
perturbations by numerically integrating the coupled, linearized Einstein,
Boltzmann, and fluid equations for all particle species. We then sample the
phase space shortly after neutrino decoupling at redshift z=10^9 when the
distribution is Fermi-Dirac. To follow the trajectory of each neutrino, we
subsequently integrate the geodesic equations for each neutrino in the
perturbed background spacetime from z=10^9 to z=13.55, using the linearized
metric found in the previous calculation to eliminate discreteness noise. The
positions and momenta resulting from this integration represent a fair sample
of the full neutrino phase space and can be used as HDM initial conditions for
N-body simulations of nonlinear structure evolution in this model. A total of
21 million neutrino particles are used in a 100 Mpc box, with Omega_cdm=0.65,
Omega_hdm=0.30, Omega_baryon=0.05, and Hubble constant H_0=50. We find that
correlations develop in the neutrino densities and momenta which are absent
when only the zeroth-order Fermi-Dirac distribution is considered.

Following the discovery by Quashnock and Lamb (1993) of an apparent excess of
$\gamma$-ray burst pairs with small angular separations, we reanalyze the
angular distribution of the bursts in the BATSE catalogue. We find that in
addition to an excess of close pairs, there is also a comparable excess of
antipodal bursts, i.e pairs of bursts separated by about 180 degrees in the
sky. Both excesses have only modest statistical significance. We reject the
hypothesis put forward by Quashnock and Lamb that burst sources are repeaters,
since it is obvious that this hypothesis does not predict an excess of
antipodal coincidences. Lacking any physical model of bursts that can explain
the antipodal pairs, we suggest that the two excesses seen in the data are
either due to an unusual statistical fluctuation or caused by some unknown
selection effect.

We investigate the accuracy of the frozen--flow approximation (FFA), recently
proposed by Matarrese \etal (1992), for following the nonlinear evolution of
cosmological density fluctuations under gravitational instability. We compare a
number of statistics between results of the FFA and nbody simulations,
including those used by Melott, Pellman \& Shandarin (1993) to test the
Zel'dovich approximation. The FFA performs reasonably well in a statistical
sense, e.g. in reproducing the counts--in--cell distribution, at small scales,
but it does poorly in the crosscorrelation with nbody which means it is
generally not moving mass to the right place, especially in models with high
small--scale power.

We demonstrate that our Galactic Center, despite little evidence for the
presence of a currently active nucleus, provides insight into the feeding of
AGN: The observed velocity field of molecular clouds can be interpreted as
tracing out the spiralling inwards of gas in a large accretion flow towards the
Galactic Center (Linden et al. 1993, Biermann et al. 1993) in the radial
distance range from a few parsec to a few hundred pc. The required effective
viscosity corresponds well to the observed turbulent velocities and
characteristic length scales. The implied mass influx provides indeed all the
material needed to maintain the presently observed star formation rate at
distances closer than about $100$ pc. We argue that the energy input from
supernova explosions due to the high rate of star formation can feed the
turbulence of the interstellar medium. This then keeps the effective viscosity
high as required to feed the star formation. We suggest that this process leads
to limit cycles in star formation, and as a consequence also to limit cycles in
the feeding of any activity at the very center.

We compute a semi-empirical atmospheric model for the dMe star AD Leo, which
constitutes the first model computed to match the continuum observations, as
well as a wide set of chromospheric spectral lines. We find good agreement
between the computed and observed spectral features, with the exception of the
Ca II K line.

Orbits in triaxial ellipsoidal potentials precess about either the major or
minor axis of the ellipsoid. In standard perturbation theory it can be shown
that a circular orbit will precess about the minor axis if its angular momentum
vector lies in a region bounded by two great circles which pass through the
intermediate axis and which are inclined with minimum separation $i_T$ from the
minor axis. We test the accuracy of the standard formula for $i_T$ by
performing orbit integrations to determine $i_S$, the simulated turnover angle
corresponding to $i_T$. We reach two principal conclusions: (i) $i_S$ is
usually greater than $i_T$, by as much as 12 degrees even for moderate
triaxialities, $A/1.2<B<C/0.8$. This reduces the expected frequency of polar
rings. (ii) $i_S$ is not a single, well-defined number but can vary by a few
degrees depending upon the initial phase of the orbit. This means that there is
a reasonable probability for capture of gas onto orbits which precess about
both axes. Interactions can then lead to substantial loss of angular momentum
and subsequent infall to the galactic centre.

We calculate the cosmological evolution of the 1-point probability
distribution function (PDF), using an analytic approximation that combines
gravitational perturbation theory with the Edgeworth expansion of the PDF. Our
method applies directly to a smoothed mass density field or to the divergence
of a smoothed peculiar velocity field, provided that rms fluctuations are small
compared to unity on the smoothing scale, and that the primordial fluctuations
that seed the growth of structure are Gaussian. We use this `Edgeworth
approximation' to compute the evolution of $<\delta|\delta|>$ and $<|delta|>$;
these measures are similar to the skewness and kurtosis of the density field,
but they are less sensitive to tails of the probability distribution, so they
may be more accurately estimated from surveys of limited volume. We compare our
analytic calculations to cosmological N-body simulations in order to assess
their range of validity. When $\sigma \ll 1$, the numerical simulations and
perturbation theory agree precisely, demonstrating that the N-body method can
yield accurate results in the regime of weakly non-linear clustering. We show
analytically that `biased' galaxy formation preserves the relation $<\delta^3>
\propto <\delta^2>^2$ predicted by second-order perturbation theory, provided
that the galaxy density is a local function of the underlying mass density.

We examine the effect of redshift space distortions on the galaxy two-point
correlation function $\xi(r_p,\pi)$ as a function of separations parallel
($r_p$) and perpendicular ($\pi$) to the line of sight. We find that the
relative velocity dispersion of pairs of IRAS galaxies is $\sigma(r)=
317^{+40}_{-49}$ \kms at $r=1 \mpc$, consistent with previous estimates derived
from optically selected galaxy catalogues. Unfortunately, the use of this
result to estimate $\Omega$ via the Cosmic Virial Theorem is thwarted by large
systematic uncertainties. We also fit for the mean relative streaming velocity
of pairs, $v_{12}(r)$, which describes the growth of fluctuations on both
linear and nonlinear scales. We find that $v_{12}(r) = 167^{+99}_{-67}$ \kms at
$r=4$\mpc, so that on average, approximately half the Hubble expansion velocity
of pairs at this separation is canceled by infall. At $r=10$\mpc, the amplitude
of the streaming is lower and $v_{12}(r) = 109^{+64}_{-47} \kms$. Linear
perturbation theory then implies that $\Omega^{0.6}/b =0.45^{+0.27}_{-0.18}$ on
scales $\sim 10-15 \mpc$. The amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ is sensitive to the
assumed shape of $\sigma(r)$; if the latter deviates substantially from a
virialized form on small scale, our best fit amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ can
deviate by a factor of two.

We present an observational mass function ranging from galaxies to massive
galaxy clusters, derived from direct dynamical mass estimates. Our mass
function shows, in the low-mass range of galaxies and groups, a behaviour in
agreement with that of standard CDM (n=-2), while in the high-mass range
(clusters) our mass function is shallower (and thus contains more power) than
standard CDM; it also results shallower than the recent mass function by
Bahcall & Cen (1993, ApJ 407, L49).

Recent work on the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks suggests
that the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, in which a large scale magnetic
field generates small scale eddys in a shearing environment, may be ultimately
responsible for this process. Although there is considerable controversy about
the origin and maintenance of this field in accretion disks, it turns out that
it is possible to argue, quite generally, using scaling arguments, that this
process is sensitive to the total pressure in an AGN disk, rather than the
pressure contributed by gas alone. We conclude that the resolution of the
conceptual difficulties implied by the presence of strong thermal and viscous
instabilities in radiation pressure and electron scattering dominated does not
lie in models that couple the total dissipation rate to the gas pressure alone,
or to some weighted mean of the gas and radiation pressures.

Using numerical simulations, we investigate the large-scale gravitational
clustering in a flat universe dominated by cold plus hot dark matter (i.e.,
$\Omega_0=\ocdm+\ohdm+\obaryon=1$). Primordial density fluctuation spectrum is
taken to have the Zel'dovich-Harrison form. Three models are studied, with
Model I having $\ocdm=0.69$, $\obaryon=0.01$, and $\ohdm=0.30$ in one flavor of
neutrinos; Model II having $\ocdm=0.60$, $\obaryon=0.10$, and $\ohdm=0.30$ in
one flavor of neutrinos; Model III having $\ocdm=0.69$, $\obaryon=0.01$, and
$\ohdm=0.30$ in three flavors of neutrinos. The initial density spectra are
normalized by the COBE quadrupole measurement, and galaxies are identified from
the peaks of initial density fields above a certain threshold chosen, to match
the observed two-point correlation on scales $\ls 10\mpc$. Thus the clustering
properties of both the mass and the galaxies are completely specified. The
biasing parameter (for the `galaxies') determined in this way is $b_g\approx
1.2$ for Model I, 1.5 for Model II and 1.6 for Model III. The clustering and
motions of the simulated `galaxies' are compared with recent observations. The
spatial distributions of galaxies in the hybrid models are very frothy;
filaments, sheets, voids etc. of sizes 10 -- 50$\mpc$ are frequently seen in
the simulations.

Early reionization changes the pattern of anisotropies expected in the cosmic
microwave background. To explore these changes, we derive from first principles
the equations governing anisotropies, focusing on the interactions of photons
with electrons. Vishniac (1987) claimed that second order terms can be large in
a re-ionized Universe, so we derive equations correct to second order in the
perturbations. There are many more second order terms than were considered by
Vishniac. To understand the basic physics involved, we present a simple
analytic approximation to the first order equation. Then turning to the sec-
ond order equation, we show that the Vishniac term is indeed the only important
one. We also present numerical results for a variety of ionization histories
[in a standard cold dark matter Universe] and show quantitatively how the sig-
nal in several experiments depends on the ionization history. The most
pronounced indication of a re-ionized Universe would be seen in very small
scale experiments; the expected signal in the Owens Valley experiment is
smaller by a factor of order ten if the last scattering surface is at a
redshift $z\simeq100$ as it would be if the Universe were re-ionized very
early. On slightly larger scales, the expected signal in a re-ionized Universe
{\it is} smaller than it would be with standard recombination, but only by a
factor of two or so.

We discuss the optical polarization properties of X-ray selected BL Lacertae
objects (XSBLs) as determined from three years of monitoring 37 BL Lac objects
and candidates. The observed objects include a complete X-ray flux limited
sample drawn from the EMS Survey. The majority of the XSBLs classi- fied solely
on the appearance of their spectra are members of the class of BL~Lacs since
they possess intrinsically polarized and variable continua. The duty cycle of
polarized emission from XSBLs is 40\%. The majority of XSBLs ($\approx 85$\%)
have preferred polarization position angles on time scales as long as three
years. This reflects stability in the geometry of the region emitting the
polarized optical emission. We discuss the observed spectral dependence of the
degree of polarization and some of the possible mechanisms for producing the
observed characteristics. While dilution of the polarized emission by the host
galaxy starlight is present in some objects, we demon- strate that the average
polarization properties derived from our observations are not drastically
affected by this effect. The objects in our monitored sample did not display
the larger than one magnitude variations generally used to characterize the
optical variability of blazars in general.

If the dark matter in galactic halos is made up of compact, macroscopic
objects (MO), such as black holes with $M_\MO >>M_{stars}$, gravitational
scattering will lead to kinematic heating of the stars. Observational
constraints on the amount of heating in the disk of the Milky Way put upper
limits on $M_\MO \ltorder 10^{6.3}\msun $. We find limits that are three orders
of magnitude more stringent by examining the heating limits in low mass stellar
systems, where higher densities of dark matter and lower relative velocities
disperse the stars in less than a billion years. Specifically, the structure
and kinematics of the Local Group member GR8 yield a limit of $M_\MO \ltorder
6\times 10^{3}\msun$. If the properties of the dark matter are universal these
results preclude the dominance of dark matter constituents in the
cosmologically interesting mass range $\sim 10^6\msun$ and limit them to $M_\MO
\ltorder 10^{3.7}\msun$. These results also rule out massive compact halo
objects as significant contributors to the kinematic heating of the Galactic
disk.

We present the results of a neutral hydrogen survey conducted with the Green
Bank 140-foot radio telescope of 47 northern objects in the polar-ring galaxy
atlas of Whitmore \etal\ (1990). We detected 39 of these above our detection
limit of 1.7 \hbox{Jy\CDOT\KMS}; the average measured flux of 21 Jy\CDOT\KMS\
corresponds to an average neutral hydrogen mass of $\rm 5.3 \times 10^9$ \MSUN
for a Hubble constant of $\rm H_0 = 75$ \KMS \ Mpc$^{-1}$. For the polar-ring
galaxies in our sample that have also been observed with radio arrays, we find
that the 21\AMIN\ (FWHM) Green Bank beam often includes much more flux than
found by the synthesis instruments for the polar rings alone; some of these
galaxies are known to have gas-rich companions. We compare the neutral hydrogen
content of the sample to the blue luminosity and IRAS fluxes. The \HI-to-blue-
light ratios of the confirmed and probable polar rings are around unity in
solar units, indicating that polar ring galaxies (or their environments) are as
gas-rich as typical irregular galaxies. For their blue luminosity, the
confirmed polar rings are underluminous in the far-infrared, as compared with
the rest of the sample. They are also FIR-underluminous for their \HI\ masses,
which suggests that most of the gas in the ring may be in stable orbits, rather
than flowing inward to trigger star formation in the central galaxy. The more
disordered class of `related objects,' which includes a number of obvious
mergers, is highly luminous in the far-infrared.

We propose that the prevalence of bipolarity in Young Stellar Objects is due
to the fine tuning that is required for spherical accretion of an ambient
medium onto a central node.It is shown that there are two steady modes that are
more likely than radial accretion, each of which is associated with a
hyperbolic central point in the meridional stream lines, and consequently with
either an equatorial inflow and an axial ejection or vice versa. In each case
the stream lines pass through a thick accretion torus, which is better thought
of as a standing pressure wave rather than as a relatively inert Keplerian
structure.We base our arguments on a simple analytic example,which is topologi
cally generic,wherein each bipolarmode is created by the rebound of accreting
matter under the action of the thermal,magnetic,turbulent and centrifugal
pressures created in the flow. In both bipolar modes the presence of non-zero
angular momentum implies axial regions wherein the pressure is first reduced
below the value at infinity and then becomes negative, where the solution fails
because rotating material can not enter this region without suction.The model
thus has empty stems where the activity of the central source must dominate.So
the basic engine of the bipolar flow discussed here is simply the rebound of
freely falling material from a thick pressure disc into an axial low pressure
region.The low mass,high velocity outflow must be produced in this region by an
additional mechanism. This is reminiscent of the cored apple structure observed
recently in the very young bipolar source VLA 1623.

I have noted a number of errors, most of them quite minor, in the {\em
Encyclopedia of Cosmology} (New York and London: Garland), 1993, Norriss S.
Hetherington, ed. The majority occur in my mathematically verbose article,
``Fundamental cosmological parameters". Some errata were passed on to me by
Prof. Ralph Alpher. In the interests of accuracy, I feel that the corrections
should be publicized, since no book review will mention more than a couple of
them. Also, the incorrectly typeset equations could lead to serious confusion
in the minds of readers seeing such material for the first time.

The large-scale bulk flow implied by the measurements of distances to
brightest cluster members within 15,000 km/s by Lauer and Postman has the
potential to put strong constraints on, or to even rule out, various models of
large-scale structure. Using PM simulations 400$h^{-1}$ Mpc on a side of five
cosmological models (Standard CDM, Tilted CDM, HDM, $\Omega = 0.3$ CDM, and
PBI), we present detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the peculiar velocity
data, which we use to assess the probability that any given model can explain
the data. These models are ruled out at confidence levels ranging from 94\%
(HDM) to 97\% (PBI). However, these results may be affected by the finite size
of the simulation volume. If the observed bulk flow remains unchanged when
calculated using a refined distance indicator with smaller scatter, all these
models will be ruled out at high confidence levels.

All direct measurements of peculiar velocities of glaxies assume the Hubble
law at low redshifts. However, it has been suggested by Segal et al (1993) that
the correlation of redshifts and fluxes in a complete sample of IRAS galaxies
is inconsistent with the Hubble law, and instead implies that redshifts are
proportional to the square of distance at small redshift. The essence of the
argument is that the luminosity function of galaxies itself can be used as a
distance indicator. We examine this possibility critically using a variety of
statistical tests, and conclude that the data do indeed support the Hubble law,
although the strongest arguments require the assumption of small density
contrasts on large scales. We identify several possible pitfalls in such an
analysis which could lead one to an erroneous conclusion.

We propose a method for deriving a dynamical lower bound on $\Omega$ from
diverging flows in low-density regions, based on the fact that large outflows
are not expected in a low-$\Omega$ universe. The velocities are assumed to be
induced by gravity from small initial fluctuations, but no assumptions are made
regarding their exact Gaussian nature, galaxy biasing, or $\Lambda$. The
derivatives of a diverging velocity field infer a nonlinear approximation to
the mass density, which is an overestimate when the true value of $\Omega$ is
assumed. This inferred density can become ridiculously negative when the
assumed $\Omega$ is too low, thus bounding $\Omega$. Observed radial peculiar
velocities of galaxies allow the \pot\ procedure to recover the required
velocity field, Gaussian smoothed at $1200\kms$. The density and the associated
errors are then inferred for different values of $\Omega$, searching for a void
which shows negative inferred density with high confidence. A preliminary
application to data in a southern void indicates that $\Omega\leq 0.3$ can be
ruled out at the $2.4$-sigma level. A detailed study of possible systematic
errors is under way.

The Galactic Center shows evidence for the presence of three important AGN
ingredients: a Black Hole ($M_\bullet\sim10^6M_\odot$), an accretion disk
($10^{-8.5} - 10^{-7} M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) and a powerful jet (jet power $\ge$
10\% disk luminosity). However, the degree of activity is very low and can
barely account for the energetics of the whole central region. Neverthelss, in
the very inner arsecond the central engine becomes dominant and provides an
interesting laboratory for the physics of central engines (Black Holes) in
galactic nuclei. We therefore give an overall picture of the central arcsecond
where we link the radio emission and the heating of the ambient medium to a
weakly accreting disk surrounding a massive Black Hole. <<<To appear in the
conference proceedings "Mass Transfer Induced Activity in Galaxies", Lexington
93, I. Shlosman (ed.)>>>

Recent observations of the radio and NIR source Sgr A* reinforce the
interpretation of the Galactic Center as a scaled down version of an AGN. The
discovery of an elongated structure at 43 GHz and increasing evidence for the
presence of an accretion disk surrounding a Black Hole lead us to assume that
both, an accretion disk and a jet, are present in the Galactic Center and are
physically linked. We model the radio emission of Sgr A* successfully with a
Blandford & K"onigl type jet and analyze the energetics of the coupled jet-disk
system in Sgr A* where jet and disk are parametrized in terms of the accretion
power. With this method we are able to confirm independently the lower limit of
the Sgr A* accretion rate \dot M >> 10^-8.5 M_sun found previously. Moreover,
using the limits imposed by observational data, we show that within such a
jet-disk model, the total jet power Q_jet is of comparable order as the
radiated disk luminosity L_disk. A jet model together with the assumption of an
10^6 M_sun Black Hole also qualitatively explains the submm excess and the lack
of non-thermal IR radiation. The small size of the visible part of the jet (< 1
mas) is due to the low accretion rate of Sgr A*. <<<A&A Letters, in press>>>

The different dynamical processes (relaxation, dynamical friction, tides and
mergers) operating in groups and clusters are reviewed. The small-scale
substructure observed in clusters is argued to be the remnants of the cores of
rich clusters that merged together, rather than large groups falling into the
cluster. The {\sl ROSAT\/} X-ray observations of two groups of galaxies are
discussed, and, contrary to a previous claim, the baryon fraction is high,
relative to the constraints from baryonic nucleosynthesis. A general theory of
the fundamental surface of groups is presented, allowing one to determine with
reasonable confidence the precise cosmo-dynamical state of a given group of
galaxies. The data from groups is then consistent with a universal true $M/L$
of $440\,h$, roughly 4 times larger than previous estimates, the discrepancy
occurring because most groups are still relatively near cosmological
turnaround. This high $M/L$ and the young cosmo-dynamical state of groups
suggests a density parameter $\Omega > 0.3$. Hickson's compact groups are
explained as a mixture of virialized groups, loose groups near full collapse,
and chance alignments from collapsing loose groups. Finally, the level of
projection effects contaminating samples of binary galaxies within groups is
shown to be important.

The idea that Fanaroff-Riley Class~I Radio Galaxies contain core jets with
Lorentz factors of the order of a few and are the parent population for BL~Lac
Objects is examined, with particular reference to the data on two FRI Radio
Galaxies, NGC~315 and NGC~6251. Conservation laws for an entraining
relativistic jet are derived and are used to determine a relationship between
Mach number and velocity for initially relativistic jets. One immediate
consequence of this relationship is that, if an initially relativistic jet is
decelerated to a transonic Mach number between, say 0.5 and 1.5, then its
velocity at this point is between 0.3 and 0.7 times the speed of light.
Analysis of the milliarcsecond and arcsecond data on NGC~315 and NGC~6251 shows
that the Lorentz factors of the core jets in these galaxies can be as high as
2-4 provided that the jet pressures are not much more than an order of
magnitude higher than the minimum pressures. Such Lorentz factors are more
plausible if the jets are inclined at $\sim 30$ degrees to the line of sight,
although larger angles would also be possible. For core Lorentz factors in the
range 2-4, the jets are mildly relativistic on the large scale and their
velocities are consistent with the jet brightness asymmetries being caused by
Doppler beaming. The Lorentz factors required for significant beaming of core
jets may be reconciled with subluminal motions of knots in the core if these
are reverse shocks advected by the jet. Moderate jet Lorentz factors are
possible if the shocks are normal and higher Lorentz factors are possible if
the shocks are oblique. This paper provides support for the idea that the
transition from two-sided to one-sided jets across the FRI/II break is due to
the transition from

This paper focuses on two aspects of the Physics of Radio Galaxies in which
it has been proposed that relativistic beaming of radiation is necessary to
account for the observations. Physical arguments are presented which show that
it is quite plausible that the jets in FRI radio galaxies are relativistic on
the parsec scale and decelerate to subrelativistic flow on the kiloparsec
scale. On the other hand it is shown that beaming of the optical continuum from
the core of Centaurus~A is not necessary to account for the excitation of the
emission line filaments in the ISM of this galaxy. Models involving
autoionizing shocks produced by the interaction between a low Mach number jet
and dense clouds along its path are capable of explaining the morphology of the
filaments and the simultaneous high excitation and low excitation lines in
their spectra.

In this paper, we have derived the the effects of strong magnetic fields
${\bf \vec B}$ on nucleon and particle reaction rates of astrophysical
significance. We have explored the sensitivity to the presence of arbitrary
degeneracy and polarization. The possible astrophysical applications of our
results are discussed.

We detected \co-line emission from a complex of dark cloud located at about
250 pc from M 31's center, which is the most conspicuous extinction feature
within the central few hund red pc as observed in $B,V,R,I$-band CCD imaging.
The darkest cloud has a 30-pc size, and the virial mass is estimated to be
$\sim 8.7\time s 10^5\Msun$, which is the most massive molecular cloud in the
bulge of M31. The conversion factor from CO intensity to \htwo column mass is
found to be by an order of magnitude greater than that for galactic molecular
clouds. The hydrogen mass-to-color excess ratio is also found to be anomalously
large.

The central region of the barred spiral galaxy M83 reveals a polar-nucleus
dust lane, wh ich extends from the NE molecular bar and crosses the central
bulge. Its SW counterpart is not visible, being hidden behind the bulge. This
asymmetry, in spite of the galaxy's face-on orientation and the symmetric bar
struct ure in the CO-line emission, indicates that the dark lane is an
off-plane structure. Such a ``polar-nucleus'' structure can be formed by a
non-coplanar, three-dimensional acc retion in a warped disk.

As a basic step for establishing the CO-line Tully-Fisher relation for
distant galaxies, we made a comparative study of HI versus CO line profiles.
Total line profiles of the CO line emission from 32 galaxies have been compared
with the corresponding HI emission. We found a good correlation between the
profiles of CO and HI. This strongly supports the thesis that CO can be used in
the Tully-Fisher relation for distant galaxies where HI observations cannot
reach. We also argue that CO can be used as an alternative to HI for
un-isolated galaxies such as those in dense cluster of galaxies. Using the
B-magnitudes and a recent calibration of the HI Tully-Fisher relation, we give
the distances for the galaxies derived from the CO-line Tully-Fisher relation
and compare them with the corresponding HI distances.

The presented results are part of a feasibility study of a Super- heated
Superconducting Granule (SSG) device for weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs) detection. The sensitivity of SSG to nuclear recoils has been explored
irradiating SSG detectors with a 70Me$\!$V neutron beam proving that energy
thresholds of $\sim$1ke$\!$V can be reached in 30$\mu$m Zn and 17$\mu$m Sn
granules. The successful irradiation experiments with neutrons encouraged us to
plan a prototype SSG dark matter detector. The status of the project will be
presented and the expected counting rate for spin-indepen- dent WIMP
interactions in SSG detectors will be discussed.

It has been recently discovered that the angular autocorrelation function of
gamma-ray bursts exhibits sharp peaks at angular separations of $\lesssim
4\deg$ (Quashnock and Lamb 1993), and at $\gtrsim 176\deg$ (Narayan and Piran
1993). While an excess of very close pairs of bursts can naturally arise from
burst repetition or from a spatial correlation of the burst sources, a physical
explanation for an angular correlation on a scale of $\simeq 180\deg$ seems
inconceivable.
  We show that both sharp peaks in the correlation function can be explained by
a possible bias in the determination of the burst positions. A generic way is
described in which the suggested bias can be introduced into the burst
localization procedure, either through instrumental imperfection or through the
software analyses. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to show that the observed
correlation function can be reproduced by the suggested effect. We demonstrate
that the results can nicely agree with the observations even if only a fraction
of the bursts are subject to the bias.
  We emphasis that the only motivation for suggesting the existence of this
bias are the features found in the angular autocorrelation function. It does
not rule out the possibility that bursts repeat. The natural way in which such
bias, if it exists, explains both sharp peaks, and the various conceivable
causes for the origin of this bias, make the bias hypothesis worth considering.

The effects of magnetic fields on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis(BBN) have been
calculated, and the impact on the abundances of the light elements have been
investigated numerically. An upper limit on the strength of primordial magnetic
fields compatible with observations of light element abundances has been thus
obtained. In the framework of standard BBN theory, the maximum strength of the
primordial magnetic fields, on scales greater than $10^4$cm but smaller than
the event horizon at the BBN epoch ($\sim 1$ min., $\sim 2\times 10^{12}$cm),
is $\le 10^{11}$ Gauss. This limit is shown to allow magnetic fields at the
time of recombination no stronger than $\sim 0.1$ gauss on scales $\ge
10^{11}{\rm cm}$. Our results also strongly indicate that, at the BBN epoch,
and for field strengths $B\le10^{13}$gauss, the effects of magnetic fields on
the primordial abundances of light elements are dominated by effects from
reaction rates in the presense of primeval magnetic fields rather than by
magnetic density effects on the expansion rate.

We investigate the effects of dynamical Comptonization on the emergent
radiation spectrum produced by near critical accretion onto a neutron star. The
flow dynamics and the transfer of radiation are self--consistently solved in
the case of a spherically symmetric, ``cold'', pure scattering flow, including
general relativity. A sequence of models, each characterized by the value of
the total observed luminosity, was obtained assuming that the spectrum at the
star surface is black body in shape. It is found that when the luminosity
approaches the Eddington limit dynamical effects become important shifting the
spectrum to the blue and producing a power--law, high--energy tail. The
relevance of these results in connection with the observed spectral properties
of LMXBs, and of Cyg X--2 in particular, are discussed.

The edge-on galaxy NGC 4565 has been observed in the 12CO(J=1-0)-line
emission using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope with an angular resolution of 15".
We obtained a scan along the major axis for +/-5' (+/- 15 kpc) about the
galactic center, and some scans perpendicular to the galactic plane. The radial
density distribution shows a dense molecular gas ring of 5 kpc radius, which is
associated with an HI ring. The molecular disk comprises two components: an
unresolved thin and dense disk, and a thick disk (or a halo) extending to a
height greater than 1.4 kpc. The position-velocity diagram shows that the
general rotation of the entire galaxy is circular with a flat rotation curve.
However, the radial distribution of molecular gas is asymmetric with respect to
the galaxy center in the sense that the molecular gas is much richer in the NW
side. We derived a radial variation of \htwo-to-(HI+ \htwo) density ratio, and
found that int erstellar gas in the central 4 kpc region is almost entirely H2,
while HI is dominant beyond 10 kpc. A similar HI-vs-\htwo\ behavior was found
in the edge-on galaxy NGC 891.

This paper describes the numerical evolution of an $N$-body system with a
slight ``temperature inversion''; i.e. the maximum velocity dispersion occurs
not at the centre but further out. Fluid models predict that the core of such a
system expands on a time-scale of thousands of central relaxation times, and
here this behaviour is qualitatively confirmed for an $N$-body system of over
3000 bodies. With certain qualifications, this demonstrates the existence in
N-body systems of one of the fundamental mechanisms which, in fluid models,
drive the gravothermal oscillations discovered by Bettwieser & Sugimoto.

We derive lithium abundances in 53 T Tauri stars (TTS), concentrating on
weak-line TTS. Our study gives the following results: 1)At luminosities $\ge
0.9 L\sun$ the Li abundances are remarkably uniform, with a mean value,
log~N(Li)=3.1, equal to the "cosmic" lithium abundance. 2)Significant Li
depletion appears below 0.5~L$\sun$ in the mass range 0.9-0.2 M$\sun$ and
increases towards lower luminosities. At the lower mass end (0.4-0.2 M$\sun$),
the observed luminosity of the Li burning turning point is about a factor 4
higher than predicted by the models. At masses 1.2-1.0 M$\sun$ the observations
imply less PMS Li burning than theoretically expected. Moreover we show that:
1)Low Li abundances appear only among stars with low $v\sin{i}$. Fast rotators
with masses around 0.8~M$\sun$ do not show evidence for strong Li depletion
towards lower luminosities as slow rotators do. 2)In a sample restricted to
only K5-K7 stars we find that the angular momentum spread before Li burning
begins is larger than a factor 10. Lithium depletion associated to angular
momentum loss during PMS evolution is not required to explain the observed
abundances. The efficiency of PMS Li burning in the mass range 0.9-0.7~M$\sun$
is reduced in the presence of rapid rotation.

The observed spatial distribution of $\gamma-$ray bursts indicates that they
probably originate at cosmological distances. At this distance scale their
variability timescale and flux above MeV imply an initial optical-depth to pair
production $> 10^{10}$. This appears to be in conflict with their highly
non-thermal spectra. We show that this difficulty can be removed if axion
bursts from supernovae are converted to $\gamma-$rays over cosmological
distances. Nonthermal bursts with the relevant flux, duration, variability and
spectra are obtained just for the range of axion masses of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}{\rm
eV}$ that accounts for the cold dark matter in the universe. The observed rate
of $\gamma-$ray bursts implies that axions should be converted efficiently to
photons in only one out of $\sim 10^{4}$ supernovae.

The dissipative infall of gas during the formation of a galaxy modifies the
density profile and shape of the dark halo. Gas dissipates energy radiatively
and sinks to the center of the dark halo forming the luminous part of a galaxy.
The resulting central density enhancement can alter the halo's orbital
distribution. We simulate dissipative infall inside of an initially triaxial
N-body dark halo by slowly growing a potential in the center of the particle
distribution. The dark halo transforms from a prolate-triaxial halo ($T \sim
0.8$) to an oblate-triaxial halo ($T \sim 0.5$) while approximately preserving
the flattening ($c/a \sim 0.5$). The main implication is that dark halos are
rounder and more oblate than previous predictions of purely collisionless
simulations with the new constraint that $b/a \gapp 0.7$. At the same time, the
distribution of intrinsic flattenings of dark halos ($\langle c/a \rangle =
0.5$, $\langle (c/a)^2 \rangle ^{1/2} = 0.15$) is preserved during the period
of baryonic infall. The oval distortions of disk galaxies should therefore be
slightly less than original predictions from collisionless dark halos. The
predicted distribution of shapes for dark halos from cosmological N-body
simulations is in better agreement with distribution of ellipticities of
elliptical galaxies if we assume all halos and galaxies become oblate-triaxial
in response to baryonic dissipation. The observed distribution of kinematic
misalignment angles is also consistent with this shape distribution if

It is well known that Gamma-ray Burst spectra often display a break at
energies $\simless 400$ keV, with some exceptions extending to several MeV.\ \
Modeling of a cosmological source population is thus non-trivial when comparing
the catalogs from instruments with different energy windows since this spectral
structure is redshifted across the trigger channels at varying levels of
sensitivity. We here include this important effect in an attempt to reconcile
all the available data sets and show that a model in which bursts have a
``standard'' spectral break at $300$ keV and occur in a population uniformly
distributed in a \qo $=1/2$ universe with no evolution can account very well
for the combined set of observations. We show that the source population cannot
be truncated at a minimum redshift $z_{min}$ beyond $\sim 0.1$, and suggest
that a simple follow-on instrument to BATSE, with the same trigger window, no
directionality and 18 times better sensitivity might be able to distinguish
between a \qo$=0.1$ and a \qo$=0.5$ universe in $3$ years of full sky coverage,
provided the source population has no luminosity evolution.

We have used maximum-likelihood estimation to determine the quadrupole
amplitude $Q_{\rm rms-PS}$ and the spectral index $n$ of the density
fluctuation power spectrum at recombination from the \cobe\ DMR data. We find a
strong correlation between the two parameters of the form $Q_{\rm
rms-PS}=(15.7\pm 2.6)\exp[0.46(1-n)]\mk$ for fixed $n$. Our result is slightly
smaller than and has a smaller statistical uncertainty than the 1992 estimate
of Smoot et al.

The formation of galaxies in a CDM cosmogony is investigated by following the
evolution of dark and baryonic matter and of the frequency- dependent spatially
averaged radiation field. The gas is allowed to form stars which are
independently treated as a fourth collisionless component. By supernovae,
energy and metal enriched gas is returned to the interstellar medium. Two
extreme cases, the formation of an isolated field galaxy and the merging of two
gas rich proto spirals are considered the latter being used as a model for
galaxy formation in a cluster. The isolated galaxy is assumed to interact with
the surrounding matter via tidal fields only, resulting in a rotation with a
spin parameter of about 0.08. The forming field galaxy shows the main
properties of spiral galaxies: A metal rich, rotatianally flattened bulge, a
metal poor anisotrope stellar halo and a exponetial disk of nearly solar
composition. The spiral is embedded in a triaxial halo of dark matter. The
stars of the bulge form from gas which is initially located in the largest
maxima of the primordial density fluctuations, whereas the halo stars originate
from gas accumulated in less pronounced maxima. Merging proto spirals evolve to
objects which can be interpreted as luminous ellipticals . The metal rich
anisotrope elliptical rotates only slowly. Depending on the geometry of the
merger event sometimes counter rotating gas is observed.

I-band CCD images of a large area of the nearby globular cluster NGC~6397
have been used to construct a surface density profile and two luminosity and
mass functions. The surface density profile extends out to 14\arcm from the
cluster center and shows no sign of a tidal cutoff. The inner profile is a
power-law with slope -0.8 steepening to -1.7 outside of 1\arcm. The mass
functions are for fields at 4\arcm\ and 11\arcm from the cluster center and
confirm the upturn in the mass function for stars less massive than about 0.4
M\solar. There appears to be an excess of low-mass stars over higher-mass stars
in the outer field with respect to the inner, in qualitative agreement with
expectations for mass segregation.

Brown dwarfs, stars with insufficient mass to burn hydrogen, could contribute
to the dark matter in the Galactic disk, galactic halos or even a background
critical density. We consider the detectability of such brown dwarfs in various
scenarios, extending previous work by allowing for the possibility that they
may have an extended mass spectrum or be clumped into dark clusters. We
investigate the constraints placed on such scenarios by the \iras survey.
Whilst an extrapolation of the mass function of visible disk stars makes it
unlikely that brown dwarfs comprise all of the proposed disk dark matter, \iras
does not exclude brown dwarfs providing the dark matter in our own halo or a
cosmological background. Neither does it improve on existing dynamical
constraints on the mass and radius of brown dwarf clusters in our halo. Future
satellites such as \iso and \sirtf will either detect brown dwarfs or brown
dwarf clusters or else severely constrain their contribution to the dark
matter.

Sub-arcsecond imagery (HRCAM, 0".35 - 0".57 FWHM) and two-dimensional
spectrography (TIGER, 0".9 FWHM) of the central nucleus of M31 have been
obtained at CFHT. The photometric data clearly show the double-peaked nucleus,
in excellent agreement with a recent HST image by Lauer et al. 1993. We built
deconvolved surface brightness models, using the multi-Gaussian expansion
method. We then perform a detailed morphological analysis of the three central
photometric components (bulge, nucleus and bright secondary peak) and derive
various spatial luminosity models (oblate and triaxial). Stellar velocity and
velocity dispersion fields were derived from the TIGER data: the former
displays an extremely rapid rotation around the true center of the galaxy,
while the latter exhibits a peaked structure offset in the opposite direction
of the brightest light peak. Neglecting these offsets,both extended versions of
the virial theorem and detailed hydrodynamical models confirm the classical
strong central mass concentration, perhaps a supermassive black hole of about
7.10**7 Msun, as well as a large excess of circular motions. These offsets,
however, suggest that the nucleus presently undergoes a strong stellar
oscillation, with non-stationary, non-axisymmetric dynamics. This too reopens
the case for a strong central mass concentration.

We present a new method for recovering the underlying velocity field from an
observed distribution of galaxies in redshift space. The method is based on a
kinematic Zel'dovich relation between the velocity and density fields in
redshift space. This relation is expressed in a differential equation slightly
modified from the usual Poisson equation, and which depends non-trivially on
$\beta \equiv \Omega^{0.6}/b$. The linear equation can be readily solved by
standard techniques of separation of variables by means of spherical harmonics.
One can also include a term describing the ``rocket effect" discussed by Kaiser
(1987). From this redshift space information alone, one can generate a
prediction of the peculiar velocity field for each harmonic ($l,m$) as a
function of distance. We note that for the quadrupole and higher order moments,
the equation is a boundary value problem with solutions dependent on both the
interior and exterior mass distribution. However, for a shell at distance $r$,
the dipole, as well as the monopole, of the velocity field in the Local Group
frame is fully determined by the interior mass distribution. This implies that
the shear of the measured velocity field, when fit to a dipole distortion,
should be aligned and consistent with the gravity field inferred from the well
determined local galaxy distribution. As a preliminary application we compute
the velocity dipole of distant shells as predicted from the 1.2Jy IRAS survey
compared to the measured velocity dipole on shells, as inferred from a recent
POTENT analysis. The coherence between the two fields is good, yielding a best
estimate of $\beta= 0.6 \pm 0.2$.

Fluids suspended in expanding laboratory systems cavitate into Voronoi foams
that degenerate through secondary cavitation of the foam walls. This robust
morphological mechanism results from a virtual competition for space between
the cavities. In cosmology, Voronoi foams are known to explain important
features of the large scale structure, but the physical mechanism for the
formation of such foams is unknown. We here present a scenario for the
formation of large scale structure: Cavitation initiates at the abrupt
reduction of radiation pressure on matter at decoupling and results in the cold
flow of matter into a single, void-dominated structure with a scale determined
by the Hubble sphere at decoupling. This mechanism does not impose restrictions
on the smoothness of the last scattering surface at decoupling and conserves
the entropy of matter during the self-organization of a single cavitation foam
spanning the observable universe.

In almost any scenario for 'cosmological' gamma-ray bursts (and in many
models where they originate in our own Galaxy), the initial energy density is
so large that the resulting relativistic plasma expands with $v\sim c$
producing a blast wave ahead of it and a reverse shock moving into the ejecta,
as it ploughs into the external medium. We evaluate the radiation expected from
these shocks,for both cosmological and galactic bursts, for various assumptions
about the strength of the magnetic field and the particle acceleration
mechanisms in the shocks. The spectra are evaluated over the whole range from
the IR to $>$ GeV, and are compared with the variety of spectral behavior
reported by BATSE, and with the X-ray and optical constraints. For bursts of
duration $\simg 1\s$ acceptable $\gamma$-ray spectra and $L_x/L_\gamma$ ratios
are readily obtained for 'cosmological' models. Blast waves in galactic models
can produce bursts of similar gamma-ray fluence and duration, but they violate
the X-ray paucity constraint, except for the shorter bursts ($\siml 1\s$). We
discuss the prospects for using O/UV and X-ray observations to discriminate
among alternative models.

If gamma-ray bursts originate in our Galaxy, they probably involve violent
disturbances in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. Any event of this kind is
likely to trigger the sudden expulsion of magnetic flux and plasma at
relativistic speed. We show that such ejecta would be braked by the
interstellar medium (ISM), and that a gamma-ray flash with duration $\sim 0.1 -
100 $ s may result from this interaction. We suggest that the
stronger,``smooth"class of bursts, recently identified from analyses of BATSE
data, could result from the deceleration of such a blast wave by the ISM. The
radiative efficiency,and hence the detectability, of such bursts would depend
on the density of the circumstellar ISM. Therefore, even if the neutron star
``triggers" were uniformly distributed in space (at least within 1--2 kpc of
the Sun), the bserved locations of bursts would correlate with regions of
above-average ISM density.

We have obtained the best fit to the light profiles of a luminosity limited
sample of elliptical and S0 galaxies with a power law \rn, letting the exponent
remain free rather than keeping it fixed at $1/n=1/4$ as in the well known \GV
formula. The introduction of a free parameter in the fitting formula (ranging
from $n=0.5$ for $<\re>=0.3$ kpc to $n=16$ for $<\re>=25$ kpc) is justified by
the existence of a good correlation between $n$ and the global galaxian
parameters, such as total luminosity and scale-radius. This result seems to be
in line with the segregation of properties between the `ordinary' and `bright'
families of early-type galaxies, and has consequence for the claimed
independence of the shape of galaxy profiles with respect to the Fundamental
Plane parameters.

On the basis of Braaten and Segel's representation of the electromagnetic
dispersion relations in a QED plasma we check the numerical accuracy of several
published analytic approximations to the plasma neutrino emission rates. As we
find none of them satisfactory we derive a new analytic approximation which is
accurate to within 4\%\ where the plasma process dominates. The correct
emission rates in the parameter regime relevant for the red giant branch in
globular clusters are larger by about $10-20$\% than those of previous stellar
evolution calculations. Therefore, the core mass of red giants at the He flash
is larger by about $0.005\M_\odot$ or 1\% than previously thought. Our bounds
on neutrino magnetic dipole moments remain virtually unchanged.

A new, fully dynamic and self-consistent radiation hydrodynamics code,
suitable for the calculation of supernovae light curves and continuum spectra,
is described. It is a multigroup (frequency-dependent) code and includes all
important $O(v/c)$ effects. It is applied to the model W7 of Nomoto,
Thielemann, \& Yokoi (1984) for supernovae of type Ia. Radioactive energy
deposition is incorporated through use of tables based upon Monte Carlo
results. Effects of line opacity (both static or line blanketing and expansion
or line blocking) are neglected, although these may prove to be important. At
maximum light, models based upon different treatments of the opacity lead to
values for $M_{B,max}$ in the range of -19.0 to -19.4. This range falls between
the values for observed supernova claimed by Leibundgut \& Tammann (1990) and
by Pierce, Ressler, \& Shure (1992).

We present a radiative-transfer calculation which reproduces the infrared
spectrum of the planetary nebula BD+30$^{\circ}$3639, fitting both the spectral
energy distribution and the spatial extent at infrared wavelengths. We obtain
an acceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the infrared bands. The
fit requires a distance of $\ge 2 \kpc$, which implies that BD+30$^\circ$3639
has evolved from a massive progenitor of several solar masses. Two surprising
results are (1) a very low dust-to-gas ratio, (2) an absence of the smallest
PAH molecules. Extrapolating back in time, we calculate the previous infrared
evolution of BD+30$^\circ$3639.

We consider the evolution of the light elements ($Li, Be$ and $B$)
incorporating the effects of their production by both neutrino process and
cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. We test the viability of the neutrino process to
resolve the long standing problem of the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B isotopic ratio which
amounts to 4 at the time of the formation of the solar system. This hypothesis
may be ultimately constrained by the $B/Be$ ratio observed in halo stars.
Though we are able to obtain a solar isotopic ratio $^{11}B/^{10}B \simeq 4$,
the current paucity of data at low metallicity prevents us from making a
definitive conclusion regarding the resolution of this problem. We show
however, that neutrino process nucleosynthesis leads to a relatively model
independent prediction that the $B/Be$ elemental ratio is large ($>$ 50) at low
metallicities ($[Fe/H] < -3.0$), if $Be$ is produced as a secondary element (as
is the case in the conventional scenario of galactic cosmic-ray
nucleosynthesis).

We estimate J-point galaxy averaged correlation functions $\wbar_J(\theta)$
for $J=2,...,9$, in a sample of the APM Galaxy Survey with more than $1.3
\times 10^6$ galaxies and a depth $ \calD \sim 400 \Mpc$. The hierarchical
amplitudes $s_J=\wbar_J/\wbar_2^{J-1}$ are roughly constant, up to $J=9$,
between $0.5 \Mpc$ and $2 \Mpc$ and decrease slowly for larger scales. At
scales larger than $7 \Mpc$ we find strong similarities between the statistical
properties of the galaxy fluctuations and the theoretical properties of matter
fluctuations evolving under the influence of gravity in an expanding universe
on assumption that the initial fluctuations are small and Gaussian. This is
most easily explained if at large scales there is no significant biasing
between matter and galaxy fluctuations. The comparison of the skewness in the
CfA and SSRS catalogues with comparable sub-samples of the APM indicates that
the volume of a ``fair sample'' has to be much larger that the one in the
combined CfA/SSRS catalogues.

We have obtained H$\alpha$ CCD images of 21 compact planetary nebulae in the
galactic bulge. All objects are resolved and, after deconvolving the seeing
disk, we find diameters of 1--2$''$ with typical uncertainties of 20\%. The
values are generally in good agreement with radio measurements but are smaller
than older optical measurements. Based on the new values, we find that the
Shklovsky method for distance determination greatly overestimates the actual
distance for all of our objects.

Velocity bias is a reduction of the velocity dispersion of tracer galaxies in
comparison to the velocity dispersion of the underlying mass field. There are
two distinct forms of velocity bias. The single particle velocity reduction,
$b_v(1)$, is the result of energy loss of a tracer population, and in
virialized regions, such as galaxy clusters, is intimately associated with mass
segregation which together lead to cluster mass underestimates. The pairwise
velocity bias, $b_v(2)$, has an additional statistical reduction if the total
mass per galaxy rises with velocity dispersion of the virialized cluster.
Values of the velocity bias are estimated from n-body simulations, finding
$b_v(1)\simeq 0.85\pm0.1$ and $b_v(2)\simeq 0.6\pm0.2$. The value of $b_v(1)$
is relatively secure and predicts that the virial radius of the cluster light
is about 20\% of the cluster mass, which can be tested with observations of
cluster mass profiles beyond the apparent virial radius. The value of $b_v(2)$
is sensitive to the formation efficiency of galaxies over environments ranging
from voids to rich clusters, the latter of which are not yet well resolved in
simulations. An $n=1$, $\Omega=1$, COBE normalized CDM spectrum requires
$b_v(2)\simeq0.20(15\mu K/Q)(\sigma_{12}/317 \kms)$ which is well below the
measured range of $b_v(2)$. The pairwise velocities at 1 \hmpc\ allow
$\Omega=1$ for a galaxy clustering bias near unity if $b_v(2)\simeq0.6$.

We follow a formalism presented by Kaiser to calculate the variance of bulk
flows in large scale surveys. We apply the formalism to a mock survey of Abell
clusters \'a la Lauer \& Postman and find the variance in the expected bulk
velocities in a universe with CDM, MDM and IRAS--QDOT power spectra. We
calculate the velocity variance as a function of the 1--D velocity dispersion
of the clusters and the size of the survey.

This paper reviews the essential physics of gravitational instability in a
Robertson-Walker background spacetime. Three approaches are presented in a
pedagogical manner, based on (1) the Eulerian fluid equations, (2) the
Lagrangian description of trajectories, and (3) the Lagrangian fluid equations.
Linear and nonlinear limits are discussed for each case. Shear and tides are
shown to play a key role in nonlinear gravitational instability.
  The Lagrangian fluid approach is used to show that several widely held
beliefs about gravitational instability are false. The following collapse
theorem is proven: for a given initial density fluctuation and growth rate, the
spherical tophat perturbation collapses more slowly than any other
configuration. We also show that density maxima are not the first points to
collapse and that underdense regions may collapse if their initial shear is
sufficiently high. The Lagrangian fluid approach leads to an almost closed set
of local evolution equations for individual mass elements. The magnetic part of
the Weyl tensor, which may be present even in the nonrelativistic (Newtonian)
limit, may prevent a purely local description. However, neglecting the magnetic
part of the Weyl tensor, we obtain predictions for high-redshift collapse that
are in good agreement with a high-resolution cold dark matter N-body
simulation.

The model of the supersymmetrical ball in the supersymmetrical standard model
with additional global U(1) fermion symmetry is presented. We show that the
supersymmetry breaking scale ( R-parity ), the global U(1) fermion symmetry
scale and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale are strictly connected to
each other. The realistic ball with $M \sim 10^5 - 10^9 M_{\odot} $ and the
radius $ R \sim 10^{12} - 10^{14} cm $ is obtained. Inside the ball all full
symmetries are restored. The ball is stabilized by superpartners and right
neutrinos which are massless inside.

In this letter we explore the suggestion of Quashnock and Lamb (1993) that
nearest neighbor correlations among gamma ray burst positions indicate the
possibility of burst repetitions within various burst sub-classes. With the aid
of Monte Carlo calculations we compare the observed nearest neighbor
distributions with those expected from an isotropic source population weighted
by the published BATSE exposure map. The significance of the results are
assessed via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, as well as by a comparison to
Monte Carlo simulations. The K-S results are in basic agreement with those of
Quashnock and Lamb. However, as Narayan and Piran (1993) point out, and the
Monte Carlo calculations confirm, the K-S test overestimates the significance
of the observed distributions. We compare the sensitivity of these results to
both the definitions of the assumed burst sub-classes and the burst positional
errors. Of the two, the positional errors are more significant and indicate
that the results of Quashnock and Lamb may be due to systematic errors, rather
than any intrinsic correlation among the burst positions. Monte Carlo
simulations also show that with the current systematic errors, the nearest
neighbor statistic is not very sensitive to moderate repetition rates. Until
the BATSE statistical and systematic errors are fully understood, the burst
nearest neighbor correlations cannot be claimed to be significant evidence for
burst repetitions. (Figures available as postscript files from the author.)

We present a formalism for analysing redshift distortions based on a
spherical harmonic expansion of the density field. We use a maximum likelihood
estimator for the combination of density and bias parameters, $\Omega^0.6/b$.
We test the method with $N$-body simulations and apply it to the 1.2 Jy IRAS
redshift survey.

The large-scale dynamics of matter is inferred from the observed peculiar
velocities of galaxies via the POTENT procedure. The smoothed fields of
velocity and mass-density fluctuations are recovered from the current data of
about 3000 galaxies. The cosmological density parameter Omega can then be
constrained in three ways: (a) by comparing the density fields of mass and
galaxies, (b) by using the velocity field in voids, and (c) by investigating
quasilinear deviations from Gaussian fluctuations. The results indicate a high
value of Omega near unity; values in the range 0.1-0.3 are rejected with high
confidence.

We examine the nature of galaxy clustering in redshift space using a method
based on an expansion of the galaxian density field in Spherical Harmonics and
linear theory. We derive a compact and self-consistent expression for the
distortion when applied to flux limited redshift surveys. The amplitude of the
distortion is controlled by the combination of the density and bias parameters,
$\beta\equiv\Omega_\circ^{0.6}/b$ as well as the shape of the real space power
spectrum, $P(k)$ (characterized by a shape parameter $\Gamma$), and its
normalization, $\sigma_8$; we exploit this fact to derive a maximum likelihood
estimator for $\beta$, $\Gamma$, and $\sigma_8$. We check our formalism using
$N$-body simulations and demonstrate it provides an unbiased estimate of
$\beta$ when the amplitude and shape of the galaxy power spectrum is known.
Application of the technique to the 1.2 Jy \iras\ redshift survey yields $\beta
=0.94\pm 0.17$ and $\Gamma=0.17\pm0.05$ (1-$\sigma$) when $\sigma_8$ is held
fixed at its best value as determined from the real space correlation function.
Allowing $\sigma_8$ to be a free parameter, we find $\beta=0.47\pm 0.25$,
$\Gamma=0.15\pm0.05$, and $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.06$.

The orthonormal set of Spherical Harmonics provides a natural way of
expanding whole sky redshift and peculiar velocity surveys.

In the rest of this volume Lahav and Fisher have presented the method of
Spherical Harmonic Analysis (SHA) and its use in estimating cosmologically
interesting parameters. Here I demonstrate the use of SHA in cross-correlating
galazy catalogues and present an estimate of the ratio of the optical and IRAS
galaxy bias parameters; b_O/b_I ~ 1.7.

We propose the zero-point of the cluster-cluster correlation function as a
sensitive test for the shape of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations. It
is now possible to go beyond the power law description to measure the point at
which the correlation function becomes zero. Four independent measurements
indicate that the zero point, $r_0$, should be in the range (40-60)$h^{-1}$Mpc.
The large value of $r_0$ at which the zero-point occurs rules out conventional
CDM models independently of the assumed amplitude. Models with $\Omega < 0.25$
should be rejected because they predict too large $r_0$. If the age of the
Universe is assumed to be larger than 15 Gyr, models with either $\Omega<0.5$
or $h> 0.55$ are rejected. We present the results of numerical simulations of
clusters in an $\Omega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of cold plus hot
dark matter (CHDM). The correlation function we determined for the simulated
clusters has a zero-point, $r_0=55h^{-1}$Mpc that accurately matches the zero
point of the observed function.

A P3M (Particle-Particle, Particle-Mesh) algorithm to compute the
gravitational force on a set of particles is described. The gravitational force
is computed using Fast Fourier Transforms. This leads to an incorrect force
when the distance between two particles is of the order of a grid cell. This
incorrect force is subtracted exactly from all particles in parallel using
convolution with the appropriate Green's function in real space in a time of
order $N_T$, irrespective of the degree of clustering of particles. Next, the
correct $1/r^2$ force is added for all neighbouring particles in parallel,
leading to an accurate algorithm which runs efficiently on a highly parallel
computer. A full force calculation for $128k$ particles on a $128^3$ grid in a
mildly clustered situation requires approximately 196 seconds on a $8k$
Connection Machine 2 with 8MHz clock. This decreases to an estimated 9.8
seconds on a full-sized $64k$ CM200.

We investigate reheating of the universe by early formation of stars and
quasars in the hierarchical clustering scheme of cold dark matter scenario,
with perturbation fluctuations normalized by the COBE data. It is found that
ionizing uv flux from OB stars with the abundance given by the standard initial
mass function is strong enough to ionize the universe from $z\approx 30$ to the
present epoch, if 1--2\% of the collapsed baryons go into stars. This lessens
significantly the CMB anisotropies at a small angular scale. Reionization also
increases the Jeans mass to $M_{\rm luminous}\approx 10^9M_\odot$ for $z\lsim
10$, which leads to a cut-off of the luminosity function of normal galaxies on
a faint side. A strong uv flux is expected at $z\approx 2-5$, and the null
result of the Gunn-Peterson test is naturally explained. Early star formation
also results in production of heavy elements, and the observational metal
abundance sets a strong constraint on the photon energy injection into the
intergalactic space.

We have carried out a deep (t=30000s) x-ray search of the eastern portion of
the L1495 cloud centered on the well known weak line T Tauri star (WTTS) V410
Tau using the ROSAT PSPC. This deep exposure enabled a search for candidate
pre-main sequence (PMS) objects in this cloud to a limit 20 times more
sensitive than that typical of the fields examined with the Einstein searches.
Despite assertions that the PMS population in Taurus-Auriga is nearly
completely known, this x-ray survey revealed 8 new PMS objects in a region 50'
in diameter, as compared to a previously known stellar population of 12
objects, including deeply embedded IRAS sources. Spectroscopic and photometric
observations enable us to place these objects in the HR Diagram. The newly
discovered objects are predominantly stars of spectral type M0 and later, and a
large fraction (6/8) appear to be surrounded by circumstellar accretion disks
as judged by their infrared excess and H alpha emission. We combined the data
for these x-ray discovered objects with extant and new data for the previously
identified PMS stars in this region to examine the history of star formation
and the frequency distribution of stellar masses in this cloud. If the ``post
ROSAT'' population is either complete or representative, we conclude (1) that
star formation in L1495 East took place 1 x 10^6 yrs ago and that the spread in
ages is small; (2) the frequency distribution of masses,

We test the hypothesis that the velocity field derived from Tully-Fisher
measurements of spiral galaxies, and that derived independently from Dn-sigma
measurements of ellipticals and S0s, are noisy versions of the same underlying
velocity field. The radial velocity fields are derived using tensor Gaussian
smoothing of radius 1200 km/s. They are compared at grid points near which the
sampling by both types of galaxies is proper. This requirement defines a volume
of ~(50 Mpc/h)^3, containing ~10 independent subvolumes, mostly limited by the
available ellipticals. The two fields are compared using a correlation
statistic, whose distribution is determined via Monte-Carlo simulations. We
find that the data is consistent with the hypothesis, at the 10% level. We
demonstrate that the failure to reject the correlation is not just a result of
the errors being big, by using the same method to rule out complete
independence between the fields at the 99.8% level. The zero points of the two
distance indicators are matched by maximizing the correlation between the two
velocity fields. There is a marginal hint that the ellipticals tend to stream
slower than the spirals by ~8%. The correlation reinforced here is consistent
with the common working hypotheses that (a) the derived large-scale velocity
field is real, (b) it has a gravitational origin, and (c) the large-scale
velocities of spirals and ellipticals are hardly biased relative to each other.
On the other hand, it does not rule out any alternative to gravity where
objects of all types obtain similar large-scale velocities.

We study the cosmic peculiar velocity field as traced by a sample of 1184
spiral, elliptical and S0 galaxies, grouped in 704 objects. We carry out a
statistical analysis, by calculating bulk flows and velocity correlation
functions for this sample and for mock catalogs which we extract from N--body
simulations. For the simulations we consider tilted (i.e. with spectral index
$n\leq 1$) CDM models with different values of the linear bias parameter $b$.
By mean of a maximum likelihood analysis we estimate the ability of the models
in fitting the observations as measured by the above statistics and in
reproducing the Local Group properties.

The cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear mode
coupling of density fluctuations. We find that for realistic cosmological
spectra there is a significant contribution to the nonlinear evolution on
scales of interest to large-scale structure from the long-wave part of the
initial spectrum. A consequence of this mode coupling is that at high redshift,
$z$, the nonlinear scale [defined by $\sigma(z)=1$] can be significantly larger
than a linear extrapolation would indicate. For the standard CDM spectrum with
a $\sigma_8=1$ normalization the mass corresponding to the nonlinear scale at
$z=20, 10, 5$ is about $100, 10, 3$ times (respectively) larger than the
linearly extrapolated value. We also investigate the possibility of divergent
contributions to the density field from long-wave modes if the spectral index
of the power spectrum $\ n<-1$. Using an approximate non-perturbative approach
we find that for $n>-3\,$ the divergent contribution appears only in the phase.
This can be related to the large-scale bulk velocity, and clarifies previous
results from N-body simulations.

The cosmic microwave background anisotropy is sensitive to the slope and
amplitude of primordial energy density and gravitational wave fluctuations, the
baryon density, the Hubble constant, the cosmological constant, the ionization
history, {\it etc.} In this Letter, we examine the degree to which these
factors can be separately resolved from combined small- and large-angular scale
anisotropy observations. We isolate directions of degeneracy in this cosmic
parameter space, but note that other cosmic observations can break the
degeneracy. (Correction to Eq. 4)

I review recent work on the radial transport of angular momentum in ionized,
Keplerian accretion disks. Proposed mechanisms include hydrodynamic and MHD
local instabilities and long range effects mediated by wave transport. The most
promising models incorporate the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, caused by
an instability of the magnetic field embedded in a differentially rotating
disk. This has the important feature that the induced turbulent motions
necessarily transport angular momentum outward. By contrast, convective modes
may transport angular momentum in either direction. Combining the magnetic
field instability with an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo driven by internal waves leads
to a model in which the dimensionless viscosity scales as $(H/r)^{4/3}$.
However, this model has a phenomenology which is quite different from the
$\alpha$ disk model. For example, an active disk implies some source of
excitation for the internal waves. In binary systems with a mass ratio of order
unity the most likely exciting mechanism is a parametric instability due to
tidal forces. This implies that in systems where the accretion stream is
intermittent, like MV Lyrae or TT Ari, epochs when the mass flow is absent or
very small will be epochs in which the disk shrinks and becomes relatively
inactive and dark. This model also implies that forced vertical mixing is
important, even in convectively stable disks. I discuss various observational
tests of this model and the focus of current theoretical work.

In this talk we discuss three different issues. First of all, there exist
several proposals how to solve cosmological problems by adiabatic expansion of
the Universe, without any use of inflation. We explain why these models do not
solve the flatness/entropy problem. On the other hand there exist some claims
that inflation also does not solve the flatness problem. We show that these
claims are correct to a certain extent for old and new inflation, but are
incorrect for simplest versions of chaotic inflation. The second issue to be
considered is the classification of inflationary models. At present many
inflationary models are compared to each other in order to understand which of
them better describes observational data. Unfortunately, this often leads to
terminological misunderstandings and even to misleading conclusions. We discuss
three coexisting types of classification of inflationary models and explain
their relation to each other. We also briefly describe the hybrid inflation
model, which combines several interesting features of different inflationary
models. Finally we show that it is possible to describe inflationary universe
by a stationary (i.e. time-independent) probability distribution to find a
domain of a given size containing matter with given properties. This represents
a strong deviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang
paradigm.

We describe a one-parameter family of models of stable spherical stellar
systems in which the phase-space distribution function depends only on energy.
The models have similar density profiles in their outer parts ($\rho\propto
r^{-4}$) and central power-law density cusps, $\rho\propto r^{3-\eta}$,
$0<\eta\le 3$. The family contains the Jaffe (1983) and Hernquist (1990) models
as special cases. We evaluate the surface brightness profile, the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion profile, and the distribution function, and discuss analogs
of King's core-fitting formula for determining mass-to-light ratio. We also
generalize the models to a two-parameter family, in which the galaxy contains a
central black hole; the second parameter is the mass of the black hole. Our
models can be used to estimate the detectability of central black holes and the
velocity-dispersion profiles of galaxies that contain central cusps, with or
without a central black hole.

We simulated the behavior of interstellar gas clouds in a companion galaxy
during a gas-dynamical interaction with the halo and disk of a spiral galaxy.
By ram pressure, the gas clouds are stripped from the companion, and accreted
to ward the disk of the spiral galaxy. If the companion's orbit is retrograde
with respect to the rotation of the spiral galaxy, infalling clouds hit the
nuclear region. Angular momentum transfer causes disruption of the inner
gaseous disk, and makes a void of interstellar gas in the bulge. If the
companion's orbit is either prograde or polar, infalling clouds are accreted by
the outer disk, and form a rotating gas ring. We show that the ram-pressure
stripping-and-accretion is one way from the companion to a gas-rich larger
galaxy, which causes disposal of interstellar gas from the companion and
effectively changes its galaxy type into earlier (redder). The ram-pressure
process is significant durig merger of galaxies, in which interstellar gas is
stripped and accreted prior to the stellar-body merger. Based on the
simulation, we discuss a possible history of interstellar gas in M31 system,
which comprises M32, NGC 205 and possible merged galaxies. The ram-pressure
stripping explains the disposal of mass lost from evolving stars in the dwarf
elliptical companion M32.

Radio continuum observations of the galactic center region have revealed a
number of vertical structures running across the galactic plane. Most of the
vertical structures are reasonably attributed either to poloidal magnetic field
or to energy release toward the halo. The relation of the continuum structures
to the molecular gas rings and their vertical extension are also discussed.
Some large-scale ejection features appear to have similarity to bubbles found
in external galaxies. Keywords: Galactic center; Radio emission; Jets; Magnetic
field

By image processing and color excess analyses of B, V, R, and I-band CCD
images of the central region of M31 taken with the Kiso 105-cm Schmidt
telescope, we found a bar of 200 pc length. We also found a more extended
``face-on" spiral feature of dark clouds, which appear t o be connected to this
bar and is probably an out-of-plane structure. The \co-line emission was
detected from the dark clouds using the Nobeyama 45m telescope, and the virial
mass of individual clouds was estimated to be about 10E6 solar masses. The CO
intensity-to-virial mass ratio is anomalously small, and so is the color
excess-to-mass ratio, which indicates a low temperature and a small amount dust
per unit gas mass in the cloud, respectively. This implies that the molecular
clouds in the central few hundred pc of M31 are more primeval, suggesting a low
star-formation and low dust supply. We propose a possible scenario for the
origin of the face-on spiral containing such gas on the basis of a ram-pressure
accretion model of stripped gas clouds from the companion galaxies. Key words:
Dark clouds -- CO line -- Galaxies; individual (M31) -- Interstellar dust --
Nuclei of galaxies.

CDM models with non-scale-free step-like spectra of adiabatic perturbations
produced in a realistic double inflationary model are compared with recent
observational data. The model contains two additional free parameters
relatively to the standard CDM model with the flat ($n=1$) initial spectrum.
Results of the COBE experiment are used for the determination of a free overall
spectrum normalization. Then predictions for the galaxy biasing parameter, the
variance for "counts in cells", the galaxy angular correlation function, bulk
flow peculiar velocities and the Mach number test are obtained. Also considered
are conditions for galaxy and quasar formation. Observational data strongly
restricts allowed values for the two remaining model parameters. However, a
non-empty region for them satisfying all considered tests is found.

The formation and evolution of an X--ray cluster is studied using a 3--D
N-body + hydrodynamical simulation which includes feedback of energy and iron
from cluster galaxies. The differences in evolution and final state between the
simulation and a similar run without feedback are highlighted. We address the
energetics of cluster gas; the distribution of dark matter, gas, and galaxies;
the thermodynamic state of cluster gas, the beta model, and the beta
discrepancy; x-ray evolution; the validity of estimates of the binding mass and
of the baryon fraction of the cluster; dynamics of the galaxy population and
velocity bias; and of the evolution of the iron abundance distribution in the
cluster. We find that preheating by galactic winds results in a lower core
density for the ICM, which in turn makes the simulated cluster fainter at high
redshift and undergo rapid luminosity evolution to the present. A strong iron
abundance gradient is present, even at high redshift. Velocity bias is present
in the galaxy population; this bias combined with the preheating from winds
drives the value of $\beta_{spec}\,=\,\sigma^{2}/\left(kT/\mu m_{p}\right)$ to
values less than one. The two fluid simulation, modelling infall only, predicts
$\beta_{spec}\,\geq\,1$, less in line with observation.

We have obtained high, 11 and 14 \kms, and medium, 40 and 53 \kms, resolution
spectra of the $z_{em} = 4.11$ quasar Q0000--2619 covering the range 4400 \AA\
to 9265 \AA . We identify nine metal absorption systems, of which four were
previously known. A fifth previously suggested system at $z_{abs} \approx
3.409$ (Turnshek et al~ 1991) is ruled out by our data. Two of the eight
systems for which the \lya~ line is in the observable range have a damped \lya~
line. Six of the nine systems show evidence for complex sub--component
structure. At our resolution and S/N we identify a total of 21 sub--components
in the nine systems. Five of the nine systems (11 of the 21 components) fall
within the $\pm 5000$ \kms~ range of the emission redshift, and are hence
classified as \zae~ absorbers. For the two damped systems we find metal
abundances of $\leq 1$% and $\leq 8$% of solar values at redshifts of 3.0541
and 3.3901 respectively. These upper limits are consistent with what would be
expected from previous determinations at lower redshifts, and our data are
hence compatible with earlier conclusions that no evidence is yet found for
chemical evolution of intervening damped and Lyman limit absorbers. For the
\zae~ systems we found indications of metallicities comparable to, and even in
excess of solar values. These much higher values compared to the damped
systems, are in favour of the intrinsic hypothesis for these systems.

We investigate inflationary models leading to density perturbations with a
spectral index $n>1$ (``blue spectra"). These perturbation spectra may be
useful to simultaneously account for both the amount of ultra large-scale power
required to fit cosmic microwave background anisotropies, such as those
measured by COBE, and that required to give bulk motions and structures on the
$\sim 50~h^{-1}$ Mpc scale.

The Lagrangian perturbation theory on Friedman-Lemaitre cosmologies
investigated and solved up to the second order in earlier papers (Buchert 1992,
Buchert \& Ehlers 1993) is evaluated up to the third order. On its basis a
model for non-linear clustering applicable to the modeling of large-scale
structure in the Universe for generic initial conditions is formulated. A
truncated model is proposed which represents the ``main body'' of the
perturbation sequence in the early non-linear regime by neglecting all
gravitational sources which describe interaction of the perturbations. However,
I also give the irrotational solutions generated by the interaction terms to
the third order, which induce vorticity in Lagrangian space. The consequences
and applicability of the solutions are put into perspective. In particular, the
model presented enables the study of previrialization effects in gravitational
clustering and the onset of non-dissipative gravitational turbulence within the
cluster environment.

We present results showing an improvement of the accuracy of perturbation
theory as applied to cosmological structure formation for a useful range of
quasilinear scales. The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of an
Einstein-de Sitter dust cosmogony investigated and solved up to the third order
in the series of papers by Buchert (1989, 1992, 1993a), Buchert \& Ehlers
(1993), Buchert (1993b), Ehlers \& Buchert (1993), is compared with numerical
simulations. In this paper we study the dynamics of pancake models as a first
step. In previous work (Coles \etal 1993, Melott \etal 1993, Melott 1993) the
accuracy of several analytical approximations for the modeling of large-scale
structure in the mildly non-linear regime was analyzed in the same way,
allowing for direct comparison of the accuracy of various approximations. In
particular, the ``Zel'dovich approximation'' (Zel'dovich 1970, 1973, hereafter
ZA) as a subclass of the first-order Lagrangian perturbation solutions was
found to provide an excellent approximation to the density field in the mildly
non-linear regime (i.e. up to a linear r.m.s. density contrast of $\sigma
\approx 2$). The performance of ZA in hierarchical clustering models can be
greatly improved by truncating the initial power spectrum (smoothing the
initial data). We here explore whether this approximation can be further
improved with higher-order corrections in the displacement mapping from
homogeneity. We study a single pancake model (truncated power-spectrum with
power-index $n=-1$) using cross-correlation statistics employed in

The analysis of the presence of substructures in 16 well-sampled clusters of
galaxies suggests a stimulating hypothesis: Clusters could be classified as
unimodal or bimodal, on the basis of to the sub-clump distribution in the {\em
3-D} space of positions and velocities. The dynamic study of these clusters
shows that their fundamental characteristics, in particular the virial masses,
are not severely biased by the presence of subclustering if the system
considered is bound.

Nuclear jets containing relativistic ``hot'' particles close to the central
engine cool dramatically by producing high energy radiation. The radiative
dissipation is similar to the famous Compton drag acting upon ``cold'' thermal
particles in a relativistic bulk flow. Highly relativistic protons induce
anisotropic showers raining electromagnetic power down onto the putative
accretion disk. Thus, the radiative signature of hot hadronic jets is x-ray
irradiation of cold thermal matter. The synchrotron radio emission of the
accelerated electrons is self-absorbed due to the strong magnetic fields close
to the magnetic nozzle.

We employ N--body/$3D$ gas dynamic simulations of the formation of galaxy
clusters to determine whether cluster X--ray morphologies can be used as
cosmological constraints. Confirming the analytic expectations of Richstone,
Loeb, \& Turner, we demonstrate that cluster evolution is sensitive to the
cosmological model in which the clusters form. We further show that
evolutionary differences are echoed in the gross morphological features of the
cluster X--ray emission.
  We examine current--epoch X--ray images of models originating from the same
initial density fields evolved in three different cosmologies: (i) an unbiased,
low density universe with $\Omega_o \se 0.2$; (ii) an unbiased universe
dominated by vacuum energy with $\Omega_o \se 0.2$ and $\lambda_o \se 0.8$ and
(iii) a biased Einstein--deSitter model ($\Omega \se 1$, $\sigma_8=0.59$).
Using measures of X--ray morphology such as the axial ratio and centroid
shifting, we demonstrate that clusters evolved in the two low $\Omega_o$ models
are much more regular, spherically symmetric, and centrally condensed than
clusters evolved in the Einstein--deSitter model. This morphology--cosmology
connection, along with the availability of a large body of cluster X--ray
observations, makes cluster X--ray morphology both a powerful and a practical
cosmological discriminant.

We examine the possibility that gamma-ray bursts arise from sources in the
Oort comet cloud, basing most of our arguments on accepted models for the
formation and spatial distribution of the cloud. We identify three severe
problems with such models: (1) There is no known mechanism for producing bursts
that can explain the observed burst rate and energetics without violating other
observational constraints. (2) The bright source counts cannot be reconciled
with standard models for the phase-space distribution of objects in the Oort
cloud. (3) The observed isotropy of the available burst data is inconsistent
with the expected angular distribution of sources in the Oort cloud. We
therefore assert that Oort cloud models of gamma-ray bursts are extremely
implausible.

In this letter we propose a physical explanation for recently reported
correlations between pairs of close and antipodal gamma-ray bursts from
publicly available BATSE catalogue. Our model is based on the cosmological
scenario in which bursters are located at cosmological distances of order of
0.5--2~Gpc. Observed distribution of gamma-ray bursts strongly suports this
assumption. If so gamma-ray bursts may provide a very good probe for
investigating the topological structure of the Universe. We notice that
correlation between antipodal events may in fact indicate that we live in the
so called Ellis' small universe which has Friedman-Roberston-Walker metric
structure and nontrivial topology.

The neutrino emissivity from two and three flavour quark matter is
numerically calculated and compared with Iwamoto's formula. We find that the
calculated emissivity is smaller than Iwamoto's result by orders of magnitude
when $p_{f}(u)+p_{f}(e)-p_{f}(d(s))$ is comparable with the temperature. We
attribute it to the severe restriction imposed by momentum conservation on the
phase space integral. We obtain an alternate formula for the neutrino
emissivity which is valid when the quarks and electrons are degenerate and
$p_{f}(u)~+~p_{f}(e)~-~p_{f}(d(s))$ is large compared to the temperature.

Although Potent purports to use only radial velocities in retrieving the
potential velocity field of galaxies, the derivation of transverse components
is implicit in the smoothing procedures. Thus the possibility of using
nonradial line integrals to derive the velocity field arises. In the case of
inhomogeneous distributions of galaxies, the optimal path for integration need
not be radial, and can be obtained by using max-flow algorithms. In this paper
we present the results of using Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain this optimal
path and velocity field.

We investigate the effect of using different distance estimators on the
recovery of the peculiar velocity field of galaxies using Potent. An
inappropriate choice of distance estimator will give rise to spurious flows. We
discuss methods of minimising these biases and the levels of accuracy required
of distance estimators to retrieve velocity fields to a given standard.

Methods for inferring the velocity field from the peculiar velocity data are
described and applied to old and newer data. Inhomogeneous Malmquist bias and
ways to avoid it are discussed and utilized. We infer that these biases are
probably important in interpreting the data.

We construct models of highly-inclined (``polar'') rings in an external
potential including both self--gravity and dissipation due to a drag force. We
adopt the oblate spheroidal scale--free logarithmic potential with axis ratio
$q=0.85$ and an initial inclination of 80$^\circ$ for the self--gravitating
rings. Stellar (dissipationless) rings suffer from mass loss during their
evolution which drives a secular change of the mean inclination toward the
poles of the potential. As much as half of the ring mass escapes in the process
and forms an inner and an outer shell of precessing orbits. If the remaining
mass is more than $\sim$ 0.02 of the enclosed galaxy mass, rings remain bound
and and are not destroyed by differential precession. The rings precess at a
constant rate for more than a precession period $\tau_p$ finding the
configuration predicted by Sparke in 1986 which warps at larger radii toward
the poles of the potential. We model shear viscosity with a velocity-dependent
drag force and find that nuclear inflow dominates over self--gravity if the
characteristic viscous inflow time scale $\tau_{vi}$ is shorter than $\sim 25
\tau_p$. Rings with $\tau_{vi}/\tau_p \ \sles \ 25$ collapse toward the nucleus
of the potential within one precession period independent of the amount of
self--gravity. Our results imply that stars and gas in real polar rings exhibit
markedly different dynamical evolutions.

We describe an analytic distribution function of a finite, oblate stellar
system that is useful for the practical modelling of dark halos. The function
is determined by lowering Evans's (1993) distribution function of a flattened,
cored isothermal system in analogy to the lowering of the singular, isothermal
sphere in the definition of the King (1966) models. We derive analytic
expressions of the density, maximal streaming velocity and velocity dispersion
profiles as a function of the potential. As for the King models, the potential
must be calculated numerically. We also present a recipe for generating N-body
realizations of this distribution function and examine the stability in three
models with dimensionless spins $\lambda=$0.0, 0.05 and 0.18 using N-body
simulations with 50,000 particles. The $\lambda=0.18$ model is unstable to the
formation of a triaxial bar within $\sim 5$ King radii while the other models
appear stable. We conclude that the slowly rotating systems are useful for
modelling flattened dark halos.

A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, with a potential of the form $ V(\phi) =
\Lambda^4 [1 + \cos(\phi/f)]$, can naturally give rise to an epoch of inflation
in the early universe (Freese, Frieman, and Olinto 1990). The potential is
naturally flat (as required by microwave background limits on the amplitude of
density fluctuations), without any fine-tuning. Successful inflation can be
achieved if $f \sim m_{pl}$ and $\Lambda \sim m_{GUT}$. Such mass scales arise
in particle physics models with a large gauge group that becomes strongly
interacting at a scale $\sim \Lambda$, {\it e.g.,} as can happen in the hidden
sector of superstring theories. The density fluctuation spectrum can be
non-scale-invariant, with more power on large length scales (Adams, Bond,
Freese, Frieman, and Olinto 1993). This enhanced power on large scales may be
useful to explain the otherwise puzzling large-scale clustering of galaxies and
clusters and their flows. Natural inflation differs from other models with
extra large-scale power in that the contribution of the tensor modes to
microwave background fluctuations is negligible; this difference should serve
as a testable feature of the model.

We study nonlinear wave phenomena in self-gravitating fluid systems, with a
particular emphasis on applications to molecular clouds. This paper presents
analytical results for one spatial dimension. We show that a large class of
physical systems can be described by theories with a ``charge density''
$q(\rho)$; this quantity replaces the density on the right hand side of the
Poisson equation for the gravitational potential. We use this formulation to
prove general results about nonlinear wave motions in self-gravitating systems.
We show that in order for stationary waves to exist, the total charge (the
integral of the charge density over the wave profile) must vanish. This
``no-charge'' property for solitary waves is related to the capability of a
system to be stable to gravitational perturbations for arbitrarily long
wavelengths. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the charge density
for the existence of solitary waves and stationary waves. We then apply these
results to study nonlinear waves in Jeans-type theories, Yukawa theories, and a
pseudo-two-dimensional treatment. We study the allowed types of wave behavior
for all of these models. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for
molecular cloud structure.

We have performed a series of N-body experiments on Connection Machine-5 in
order to simulate the formation of galaxy clusters gravitationally dominated by
a massive dark background. In accordance with previous authors we find an
extremely inhomogeneous evolution where subcondensations are continually formed
and merged. The final distribution of galaxies is more centrally condensed than
that of dark matter particles. We have analyzed the origin of this galaxy-dark
matter segregation and also the origin of subclustering leading to this effect.
We have then analysed, analytically and numerically, the dependence of final
segregation on the physical parameters characterizing the model of
protocluster. We also find that such a segregation persists even when inelastic
encounters of dark halos around galaxies are taken into account. We conclude
that this effect cannot be in general avoided in any hierarchical clustering
scenario.

The recent detection of microlensing of stars of LMC by compact objects in
the halo of our galaxy suggests that our galaxy is surrounded by a non-luminous
halo made of compact objects with mass of about $(0.03-0.5) \msun$. The rate of
detection could be consistent with the assumption that these halo objects are
distributed with a softened isothermal profile with a core radius of $(2-8)$Kpc
and asymptotic circular velocity of $220\kms$. Taken in isolation, this
observation is consistent with a universe having only baryonic dark matter
(BDM, hereafter) contributing $\Omega_b=\Omega_{total}\simeq0.06$ which will,
however, violently contradict several other large scale observations, notably
the COBE-DMR results. Alternatively one can assume that galaxies like ours are
surrounded by both BDM and non-baryonic dark matter (NBDM, hereafter). A model
with a single component for NBDM with, say,
$\Omega_b\simeq0.06,\Omega_{cdm}\simeq0.94$, is also ruled out if we demand
that: (i) at least thirty percent of the dark matter density within $100$ kpc
is baryonic and (ii) galactic structures should have collapsed by redshift of
$z=1$. Further if half or more of the dark matter within $100 kpc$ is baryonic
then the maximum value of $\Omega_{dm}$, contributed by NBDM clustered at
galactic scales, can only be about $\Omega_{max}\simeq0.29$. Models with C+HDM
cannot satisfy this constraint but $\Lambda$+ CDM models are still

We use high resolution dissipationless N-body simulations to examine the
spatial distribution of galaxy clusters on large scales. The Standard CDM model
and two of its main competitors, Low density CDM and Mixed Dark Matter are
compared.The two-point correlation function of simulated clusters is compared
with an extended survey of APM clusters , and it is found that Standard CDM
exhibits a lack of power on all scales, whereas the two alternative scenarios
are able to match the spatial correlations well. Of the remaining two
models,the velocities in the MDM universe have a higher amplitude and their
distribution is much broader. We compare these peculiar velocities with
observations and find that both models have difficulty in reproducing the
observed numbers of very high peculiar velocity clusters. The reliable
detection of several more clusters with velocities in excess of 1000 km/s would
render the LCDM scenario in particular very unlikely.

We use ensembles of high-resolution CDM simulations to investigate the shape
and amplitude of the two point correlation function of rich clusters. The
standard scale-invariant CDM model with $\Omega=1$ provides a poor description
of the clustering measured from the APM rich cluster redshift survey, which is
better fitted by models with more power at large scales. The amplitudes of the
rich cluster correlation functions measured from our models depend weakly on
cluster richness. Analytic calculations of the clustering of peaks in a
Gaussian density field overestimate the amplitude of the N-body cluster
correlation functions, but reproduce qualitatively the weak trend with cluster
richness. Our results suggest that the high amplitude measured for the
correlation function of richness class $R \geq 2$ Abell clusters is either an
artefact arising from incompleteness in the Abell catalogue, or an indication
that the density perturbations in the early universe were very non-Gaussian.

Some recently proposed approximations to follow the non--linear evolution of
collisionless matter perturbations in the universe are reviewed. The first one,
called frozen--flow approximation, is an Eulerian method within Newtonian
theory, and is based on neglecting the role of particle inertia compared to the
damping implied by the Hubble drag. The second approach is General Relativistic
and Lagrangian; it is based on following the evolution of fluid and geometric
observables in the rest frame of each fluid element, under the only
approximation of neglecting the back--reaction on the system of the
gravitational radiation emitted during non--linear collapse.

We examine the 10\m\ emission of the central regions of 281 spiral galaxies,
after having compiled all ground-based, small-aperture ($\sim$5") broad-band
photometric observations at \l$\sim$10\m\ (N magnitudes) published in the
literature. We evaluate the compactness of the $\sim$10\m\ emission of galaxy
nuclei by comparing these small-beam measures with the large-beam IRAS 12\m\
fluxes. In the analysis of different subsets of objects, we apply survival
analysis techniques in order to exploit the information contained in
``censored'' data (i.e., upper limits on the fluxes). Seyferts are found to
contain the most powerful nuclear sources of mid-infrared emission, which in
$\sim$1/3 of cases provide the bulk of the emission of the entire galaxy; thus,
mid-infrared emission in the outer disc regions is not uncommon in Seyferts.
The 10\m\ emission of Seyferts appears to be unrelated to their X-ray emission.
HII region-like nuclei are stronger mid-infrared sources than normal nuclei and
LINER nuclei (whose level of emission is not distinguishable from that of
normal nuclei). Interacting objects have, on average, greater 10\m\
luminosities than non-interacting ones and exhibit more compact emission.
Early-type spirals have stronger and more compact 10\m\ emission than late-type
ones. Barred spirals are brighter at $\sim$10\m\ than unbarred systems,
essentially because they more frequently contain HII region-like nuclei. The
results of our detailed comparison between the behaviour of various categories
of objects stress that the 10\m\ emission of spiral nuclei is closely linked to
the (predominantly non-thermal synchrotron) radio

The determined abundances of primordial $^4He$ and $^7Li$ provide a basis
with which to test the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis in
conjunction with the other two light element isotopes $D$ and $^3He$, also
produced in the big bang. Overall, consistency in the standard big bang
nucleosynthesis model is best achieved for a baryon-to-photon ratio of
typically $3 \times 10^{-10}$ for which the primordial value of $D$ is five
times greater than the present observed abundance and about three times greater
than the pre-solar value. We consider various models for the chemical evolution
of the Galaxy to test the feasibility for the destruction of D without the
overproduction of $^3He$ and overall metallicity. Models which are capable of
achieving this goal include ones with a star formation rate proportional to the
gas mass fraction or an exponentially decreasing star formation rate. We
discuss the effect of parameters that govern the initial mass function and of
surviving fractions of $^3He$ in stars between one and three solar masses.

The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of homogeneous-isotropic
Friedman-Lemaitre cosmogonies investigated and solved in the series of papers
by Buchert (1989), (1992), Buchert & Ehlers (1993), Buchert (1993a,b), Ehlers &
Buchert (1993), is illustrated. The third-order solution of this theory for
generic initial conditions is presented and realized in a special case by
employing methods of high-spatial resolution of the density field.

Several simple mergers between model galaxy clusters containing a mixture of
gas and dark matter are examined, testing the coupling of the gas to the
underlying collisionless material. The gas is shocked, irreversibly dissipating
the energy fed into it by the collisionless component and forms a resolved
constant-density core. For the dark matter, however, admixture of phase space
vacuum is not very efficient and a constant-density core is not produced. In
the final state the central gas has little residual kinetic energy, indicating
that streaming motions do not help to support the gas.

We present a practical guide to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (\SPH) and
its application to astrophysical problems. Although remarkably robust, \SPH\
must be used with care if the results are to be meaningful since the accuracy
of \SPH\ is sensitive to the arrangement of the particles and the form of the
smoothing kernel. In particular, the initial conditions for any \SPH\
simulation must consist of particles in dynamic equilibrium. We describe some
of the numerical difficulties that may be encountered when using \SPH, and how
these may be overcome. Through our experience in using \SPH\ code to model
convective stars, galaxy clusters and large scale structure problems we have
developed many diagnostic tests. We give these here as an aid to rapid
identification of errors, together with a list of basic prerequisites for the
most efficient implementation of \SPH.

The astrophysical S--factor and reaction rates for the triple--alpha process
are calculated in the direct--capture model. It is shown that the stellar
carbon production is extremely sensitive to small variations in the N--N
interaction.

The $\alpha$--$\alpha$ differential cross sections are analyzed in the
optical model using a double--folded potential. With the knowledge of this
potential bound and resonance--state properties of $\alpha$--cluster states in
$^{8}$Be and $^{12}$C as well as astrophysical S--factors of
$^{4}$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{8}$Be and $^{8}$Be($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{12}$C are
calculated. $\Gamma_{\gamma}$--widths and B(E2)--values are deduced.

In this paper we review the two main approaches to the problem of Malmquist
bias which have been adopted in the cosmology literature, and show how these
two formulations of the problem represent fundamentally different views of the
nature of probability. We discuss the assumptions upon which both approaches
are based and indicate some of their limitations. In particular we identify a
basic flaw in the definition of homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist
corrections as they have frequently been applied in the literature, and
indicate how this flaw may be corrected. (Figures available on request).

The statistical properties of galaxy distance estimators are studied and a
rigorous framework is developed for identifying and removing the effects of
Malmquist bias due to obsevational selection. The prescription of Schechter
(1980) for defining unbiased distance estimators is extended to more general --
and more realistic -- cases. The derivation of `optimal' unbiased distance
estimators of minimum dispersion, by utilising information from additional --
suitably correlated -- observables, is discussed and the results applied to a
calibrating sample from the Fornax cluster, as used in the Mathewson spiral
galaxy redshift survey. The optimal distance estimator derived from I-band
magnitude, diameter and 21cm line width has an intrinsic scatter which is 25 \%
smaller than that of the Tully-Fisher relation quoted for this calibrating
sample. (Figures are available on request).

We present the initial results of a study of globular clusters in M31, using
the Faint Object Camera (FOC) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The sample
of objects consists of 13 clusters spanning a range of properties. Three inde-
pendent image deconvolution techniques were used in order to compensate for the
optical problems of the HST, leading to mutually fully consistent results. We
present detailed tests and comparisons to determine the reliability and limits
of these deconvolution methods, and conclude that high-quality surface photome-
try of M31 globulars is possible with the HST data. Surface brightness profiles
have been extracted, and core radii, half-light radii, and central surface
brightness values have been measured for all of the clusters in the sample.
Their comparison with the values derived from ground-based observations indi-
cates the later to be systematically and strongly biased by the seeing effects,
as it may be expected. A comparison of the structural parameters with those of
the Galactic globulars shows that the structural properties of the M31 globu-
lars are very similar to those of their Galactic counterparts. A candidate for
a post-core-collapse cluster, Bo 343 = G 105, has been already identified from
these data; this is the first such detection in the M31 g. c. system.

In this paper we describe weighting techniques used for the optimal
coaddition of CCD frames with differing characteristics. Optimal means maximum
signal-to-noise (s/n) for stellar objects. We derive formulae for four
applications: 1) object detection via matched filter, 2) object detection
identical to DAOFIND, 3) aperture photometry, and 4) ALLSTAR profile-fitting
photometry. We have included examples involving 21 frames for which either the
sky brightness or image resolution varied by a factor of three. The gains in
s/n were modest for most of the examples, except for DAOFIND detection with
varying image resolution which exhibited a substantial s/n increase. Even
though the only consideration was maximizing s/n, the image resolution was seen
to improve for most of the variable resolution examples. Also discussed are
empirical fits for the weighting and the availability of the program, WEIGHT,
used to generate the weighting for the individual frames. Finally, we include
appendices describing the effects of clipping algorithms and a scheme for
star/galaxy and cosmic ray/star discrimination.

We apply the new distance measuring technique of Hendry, O'Dell and Collier-
Cameron, 1993, to the Pleiades and $\alpha$ Persei clusters. The method relies
on knowledge of the periods, rotation velocities and angular diameters of a
sample of late-type stars within each cluster. The angular diameters were found
by recalibrating the Barnes-Evans surface brightness relation. Applying our new
distance method we derive a Pleiades distance in very good agreement with
previous ZAMS fitting determinations, whereas our $\alpha$ Persei distance
appears substantially greater. In response to this greater distance, we apply a
recent semi-empirical main-seqeunce fitting technique to $\alpha$ Persei and
confirm the findings of our new distance indicator. (Figures / preprint

We report the first results of a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the core
of the Shapley Concentration, the richest nearby supercluster of clusters of
galaxies. We have measured 311 new galaxy redshifts in an area of $\sim 4.5$
square degrees centered around the Abell cluster A3558. Considering also the
data already available in the literature, the total number of galaxy redshifts
in this area amounts to more than 500. On the basis of these data we estimate
the mean velocities and the velocity dispersions of the Abell clusters A3556,
A3558 and the poor cluster SC 1329 -314. Finally, from an analysis of the
projected and three--dimensional distributions of galaxies in this region, we
estimate the galaxy overdensity and find that the core of the Shapley
Concentration has an interesting, very complex dynamical state: the main
clusters appear to be interacting with each other, forming a single elongated
structure containing many subcondensations.

We present a new technique for estimating the distance to young open
clusters. The method requires accurate measurement of the axial rotation period
of late-type members of the cluster: rotation periods are first combined with
projected rotation velocities and an estimate of the angular diameter for each
star -- obtained using the Barnes-Evans relation between colour and surface
brightness. A 'best' cluster distance estimate is then determined using
standard techniques from the theory of order statistics which are in common use
in the general statistics literature. It is hoped that this new method will
prove a useful adjoint to more traditional distance methods, and will provide a
better %determination of the distance scale within the solar neighbourhood.

The non--linear dynamics of cosmological perturbations of an irrotational
collisionless fluid is analyzed within General Relativity. Relativistic and
Newtonian solutions are compared, stressing the different role of boundary
conditions in the two theories. Cosmological implications of relativistic
effects, already present at second order in perturbation theory, are studied
and the dynamical role of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor is elucidated.

We calculate filling factors (${\varepsilon}$) and ionized masses (M$_{\rm
i}$) for a total of 84 galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae (PNe) at
known distances. To do these calculations, we have chosen forbidden line
electron densities, observed angular diameters, and H${\beta}$ fluxes, from the
most recent measurements available in the literature. Statistical analysis on
the distributions of ${\varepsilon}$ and ${\rm M_i}$ show that (1) the ranges
of values of these parameters is wider than what was previously found; (2) the
mean value of the filling factor is between $0.3$ and $0.4$, for the different
sets; (3) the mean value of the ionized mass is between $0.1$ and $0.25$
$M_{\odot}$; (4) a clear correlation between the filling factors and the
dimensions of the PNe was not found when distance-independent sets of PNe were
used; (5) for extragalactic PNe, where distance errors are not a factor, the
filling factors and the ionized masses anticorrelate tightly with the electron
densities. The results indicate that the modified Shklowsky distance method is
correct.

Nonlinear approximations to problems with mixed boundary conditions are
useful for predicting large-scale streaming velocities from the density field,
or vice-versa. We evaluate the schemes of Bernardeau \cite{bernardeau92},
Gramann \cite{gramann93}, and Nusser \etal \cite{nusser91}, using smoothed
density and velocity fields obtained from $N$-body simulations of a CDM
universe. The approximation of Nusser \etal is overall the most accurate and
robust. For Gaussian smoothing of 1000\kms\ the mean error in the approximated
relative density perturbation, $\delta$, is smaller than 0.06, and the
dispersion is 0.1. The \rms\ error in the estimated velocity is smaller than
60\kms, and the dispersion is 40\kms. For smoothing of 500\kms\ these numbers
increase by about a factor $\sim 2$ for $\delta < 4-5$, but deteriorate at
higher densities. The other approximations are comparable to those of Nusser
\etal for smoothing of 1000\kms, but are much less successful for the smaller
smoothing of 500\kms.

Information about the physical processes that generate the primordial
fluctuations in the early universe can be gained by testing the Gaussian nature
of the fluctuations through cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR)
temperature anisotropy experiments. One of the crucial aspects of density
perturbations that are produced by the standard inflation scenario is that they
are Gaussian, whereas seeds produced by topological defects left over from an
early cosmic phase transition tend to be non-Gaussian. To carry out this test,
sophisticated statistical tools are required. In this paper, we will discuss
several such statistical tools, including multivariant skewness and kurtosis,
  Euler-Poincare characteristics, the three point temperature correlation
function, and the Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic defined through bispectral
estimates of a one dimensional dataset. The effect of noise present in the
current data is discussed in detail and the COBE 53 GHz dataset is analyzed.
Our analysis shows that, on the large angular scale to which COBE is sensitive,
the statistics are probably Gaussian. On the small angular scales, the
importance of Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic is stressed, and the minimum sample
size required to test Gaussianity is estimated. Although the current dataset
available from various experiments at half-degree scales is still too small,
improvement of the dataset by roughly a factor of two will be enough to test
the Gaussianity statistically. On the arcminute scales, we analyze the recent
RING data through bispectral analysis, and the result

The local galaxy distribution offers an interesting constraint to
cosmological models of structure formation. The galaxies are distributed in a
long, filamentary structure, presumably the result of large amplitude
gravitational instability, yet the local velocity field is cold. In particular,
there are no blueshifted galaxies within 5h^-1 Mpc except those within the
Local Group radius of 1h^-1 Mpc. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate
that such a situation is extremely rare for an observer in Omega=1 CDM models,
but is not uncommon in mixed dark matter (MDM) models that include massive
neutrinos.

We present results of numerical simulation of thin accretion disks and winds.
We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique for this purpose. We
show that the simulation agrees very well with the recent theoretical work on
the shock formation. The most significant conclusion is that shocks in an
inviscid flow are extremely stable. For the first time, our work also removes
the ambiguity in terms of the location and stability of shocks in adiabatic
flows.

We consider a weighted biasing scheme for galaxy clustering. This differs
from previous treatments in the fact that the biased density field coincides
with the background mass--density whenever the latter exceeds a given threshold
value. There is some physical motivation for this scheme and it is in better
accord with intuitive ideas than models based on the Kaiser (1984) analysis of
the clustering of rich clusters. We explain how different classes of object
could be biased in different ways with respect to the underlying density
distribution but still have $b=1$. We also show that if one applies our scheme
consistently a weak dependence of $b$ upon density can be implied. This could
also be the reason why the correlation function of galaxies in groups does not
differ substantially from the correlation function of all galaxies.

We discuss the influence of gravitational waves (GWs) upon the polarisation
of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). We show how to compute the
{\em rms} temperature anisotropy and polarisation of the CMBR induced by GWs of
arbitrary wavelength. We find that the ratio of polarisation, $\Pi$, to
anisotropy, $A$, can be as large as $\sim 40$\%, but is sensitively dependent
upon the GW spectrum and the cosmological ionisation history. We argue that
CMBR polarisation measurements can provide useful constraints on cosmological
models.

The integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) can be an important factor in the
generation of Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies on all scales,
especially in a reionized curvature or lambda dominated universe. We present an
analytic treatment of the ISW effect, which is analogous to thick last
scattering surface techniques for the Doppler effect, that compares quite well
with the full numerical calculations. The power spectrum of temperature
fluctuations due to the small scale ISW effect has wave number dependence
k^{-5} times that of the matter power spectrum.

We present results of numerical simulation of inviscid thick accretion disks
and wind flows around black holes. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
technique for this purpose. Formation of thick disks are found to be preceded
by shock waves travelling away from the centrifugal barrier. For a large range
of the parameter space, the travelling shock settles at a distance close to the
location obtained by a one-and-a-half dimensional model of inviscid accretion
disks. Occasionally, it is observed that accretion processes are aided by the
formation of oblique shock waves, particularly in the initial transient phase.
The post-shock region (where infall velocity suddenly becomes very small)
resembles that of the usual model of thick accretion disk discussed in the
literature, though they have considerable turbulence. The flow subsequently
becomes supersonic before falling into the black hole. In a large number of
cases which we simulate, we find the formation of strong winds which are hot
and subsonic when originated from the disk surface very close to the black hole
but become supersonic within a few tens of the Schwarzschild radius of the
blackhole. In the case of accretion of high angular momentum flow, very little
amount of matter is accreted directly onto the black hole. Most of the matter
is, however, first squeezed to a small volume close to the black hole, and
subsequently expands and is expelled as a strong wind. It is quite possible
that this expulsion of matter and the formation of cosmic radio jets is aided
by the shock heating in the inner parts of the accretion disks.

Many of the current round of experiments searching for anisotropies in the
MBR are confronting the problem of how to disentangle the cosmic signal from
contamination due to galactic and intergalactic foreground sources. Here we
show how commonly used likelihood function techniques can be generalized to
account for foreground. Specifically we set some restrictions on the spectrum
of foreground contamination but allow the amplitude to vary arbitrarily. The
likelihood function thus generalized gives reasonable limits on the MBR
anisotropy which, in some cases, are not much less restrictive than what one
would get from more detailed modeling of the foreground. Furthermore, the
likelihood function is exactly the same as one would obtain by simply
projecting out foreground contamination and just looking at the reduced data
set. We apply this generalized analysis to the recent medium angle data sets of
ACME-HEMT and MAX. The resulting analysis constrains the one free parameter in
the standard cold dark matter theory to be Q=18_-5^+8 microK. This best fit
value, although in striking agreement with the normalization from COBE, is not
a very good fit, with an overall chi^2/ degree of freedom =208/168. We also
argue against three commonly used methods of dealing with foreground: (i)
ignoring it completely; (ii) subtracting off a best fit foreground and treating
the residuals as if uncontaminated; and (iii) culling data which appears to be
contaminated by foreground.

The observations of bulge/disk segregation in the Universe are reviewed with
a focus on whether the observed segregation in clusters is local or global, and
whether there is bulge-disk segregation on large-scales. The high concentration
of bulge-rich galaxies in the cores of clusters of galaxies can be accounted
for by several popular physical processes: 1) biased early elliptical
formation, 2) abortion of disk formation by tidal destruction of the gas
reservoirs that fuel such disks, 3) ram pressure stripping of the gas in disks
by intergalactic gas, 4) merging of spiral galaxies into ellipticals (which is
the main focus of this review). A global scenario is outlined incorporating
each of these processes.

Long lived modes of elliptical galaxies can exist {\it \`a la} van Kampen.
Specific systems may possess long lived oscillations which Landau damp on time
scales longer than a Hubble time. Some physical processes such as a close
encounter, tidal forces from a cluster or an orbiting satellite could
preferentially excite a coherent mode. These may relate to the observed faint
structure in elliptical galaxies such as shells and ripples. Their detection in
projected phase space would ultimately provide a detailed probe of the
underlying potential. I give an overview of linear perturbations to stationary
solutions of the Vlasov equation, including a discretized Hermite polynomial
expansion which explicitly demonstrates completeness and orthogonality of
solutions. Some exact solutions are shown, which implies the feasibility of
such a procedure and suggest future fully numerical studies.

The effects of reionization, occurring after standard recombination in cold
dark matter-dominated models, on CMB anisotropies are investigated. Late-time
reionization reduces the CMB anisotropies, in particular, on degree scales. It
is found that constraints on cold dark matter-dominated models from the highest
frequency channel of the 9-point South Pole data are significantly relaxed for
models which are consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis if reionization is
assumed to have occurred by redshift $\sim 20.$

We have worked out evolutionary synthesis models of the broad-band spectral
energy distribution of elliptical galaxies over the whole frequency range from
UV to far--IR. Internal extinction and far--IR re--emission by interstellar
dust have been taken into account in a self--consistent way. Diffuse dust
emission has been modelled in terms of two components: warm dust, located in
regions of high radiation intensity, and cold dust, heated by the general
radiation field. Emission from circumstellar dust clouds at different galactic
ages was also taken into account. The models reproduce well the present average
broad--band spectrum of nearby ellipticals over about four decades in
frequency. Under the assumption of a dust--to--gas ratio proportional to the
metallicity, the fraction of bolometric luminosity coming out at far-IR
wavelengths strongly evolves during the galaxy lifetime, ranging from very low
local values ($\lsim 0.5\%$) to $\sim 30\%$ or more in the first billion years.
Some models even imply that early phases are optically thick; these models
provide an excellent fit of the observed spectral energy distribution of the
high redshift galaxy IRAS F10214$+$4724. Far--IR observations may thus play a
key role in investigating the early evolution of elliptical galaxies. A strong
far-IR evolution of early-type galaxies might be a crucial ingredient to
explain the deep $60\mic$ IRAS counts.

We report on the Lovers of Active Galaxies' (LAG) monitoring of the Seyfert 1
galaxy Markarian 279 from January to June 1990. The source, which was in a very
bright state, gradually weakened after the first month of monitoring: the
H-Alpha and H-Beta flux decreased by 20% and 35% respectively, and the
continuum under H-Alpha by 30%. The luminosity-weighted radius of the broad
line region (BLR), as derived from the cross-correlation function, is of the
order of 10 light days. This result is very uncertain because the features in
the light curves are very shallow, but it is unlikely that the radius of the
BLR is more than 1 light month. The profile variations of H-Alpha confirm that
the prevailing motions are not radial. The data of the present campaign and
those obtained in previous years, when the source was in a much weaker state,
show that the red asymmetry of the Balmer lines correlates positively with the
broad line flux. This new effect is briefly discussed.

The Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 was intensely monitored between 1991 December
and 1992 August. We present the results from the ground-based observations in
the optical and near-IR, which complement the data-set from the IUE, discussed
elsewhere. Spectroscopic and photometric data from many observatories were
combined in order to obtain well sampled light curves of the continuum and of
H-Beta. During the campaign the source varied significantly. The light curves
of the optical continuum and of H-Beta are similar to those obtained with the
IUE. The near-IR flux did not vary significantly except for an increase at the
end of the campaign. The optical continuum and the flux of H-Beta lag the UV
continuum by 1 day or less and by 8 days respectively. These results confirm
that the continuum variations are simultaneous or have a very small lag across
the entire UV-optical range, and that the lines of NGC 3783 respond to ionizing
continuum variations with less delay than those of NGC 5548. As in NGC 5548,
the lag of H-Beta is greater than those of the high ionization lines.

We present UBVI surface photometry of a sample of low surface brightness
(LSB) disk galaxies. LSB disk galaxies are fairly well described as exponential
disks with no preferred value for either scale length, central surface
brightness, or rotational velocity. Indeed, the distribution of scale lengths
is indistinguishable from that of high surface brightness spirals, indicating
that dynamically similar galaxies (e.g., those with comparable Rv^2) exist over
a large range in surface density.
  These LSB galaxies are strikingly blue. The complete lack of correlation
between central surface brightness and color rules out any fading scenario.
Similarly, the oxygen abundances inferred from HII region spectra are
uncorrelated with color so the low metallicities are not the primary cause of
the blue colors. While these are difficult to interpret in the absence of
significant star formation, the most plausible scenario is a stellar population
with a young mean age stemming from late formation and subsequent slow
evolution.
  These properties suggest that LSB disks formed from low initial overdensities
with correspondingly late collapse times.

Using redshift samples, we calculate the cross-correlation functions of LSB
galaxies with normal galaxies in complete samples (i.e. CfA and IRAS), which
enables us to compare directly the amplitudes and shapes of the correlation
functions. For pair separations $r\gs 2\mpc$, we find that the shape is in
agreement with that of the correlation functions for other galaxies. The
amplitudes ($A$) of $\xiab (r)$ are lower than those of the autocorrelation
functions for the CfA and IRAS samples, with $A_{\rm LSB-CfA}:A_{\rm
CfA-CfA}\approx 0.4$ and $A_{\rm LSB-IRAS}:A_{\rm IRAS-IRAS}\approx 0.6$. These
results suggest that LSB galaxies are imbedded in the same large scale
structure as other galaxies, but are less strongly clustered. This offers the
hope that LSB galaxies may be unbiased tracers of the mass density on large
scales. For $r\ls 2\mpc$, the cross-correlation functions are significantly
lower than that expected from the extrapolation of $\xiab$ on larger scales,
showing that the formation and survival of LSB galaxies may be inhibited by
interaction with neighboring galaxies.
  The model which matches these observations suggests that strong luminosity
segregation in galaxy clustering is not a necessary consequence of biased
galaxy formation, unless the effect of surface brightness is taken in to
account. It is also implies a significant mass density in LSB galaxies.

We have obtained surface photometry in U, B, R and I for a complete optically
selected sample of 45 early-type spiral galaxies, to investigate the colors and
color gradients of spiral bulges. Color profiles in U-R, B-R, U-B and R-I have
been determined in wedges opening on the minor axes. Based on several criteria,
we have defined a subsample of 18 objects whose colors are largely unaffected
by dust. We find that the colors of bulges are predominantly bluer than those
of ellipticals. This result holds even when bulges are compared to ellipticals
of the same luminosity, and indicates that bulges are younger and/or more
metal-poor than elliptical galaxies. Most bulges do not reach solar
metallicities. Bulges show predominantly negative color gradients (bluer
outward) that increases with bulge luminosity. The similarity with ellipticals
suggests that the formation of the disk did not affect the stellar populations
of the bulge in a major way.

We present ROSAT PSPC observations of the nova-like, or intermediate polar,
TT Ari and the eclipsing polar DP Leo. Observations of TT Ari were performed as
part of a simultaneous multiwavelength campaign. The X-ray spectrum of TT Ari
from ROSAT was combined with Ginga observations to suggest the presence of
three distinct emission components: an optically thin plasma, a dominating
bremsstrahlung continuum and one or more iron emission lines. Simultaneous and
later IUE observations show modulation in the absorption component of the P
Cygni-like CIV line on the spectroscopic period indicating a complex wind
structure. Three eclipses were observed from the DP Leo system with intensity
dips, not previously observed, occurring prior to each eclipse. The dips are
interpreted as the eclipse of the main emission region by an accretion stream
varying in impact position or stream shape with time. The DP Leo spectrum is
well fit by either a 25 eV blackbody or a soft power law. No evidence exists
for accretion onto the stronger magnetic pole and severe limits were placed
upon the flux from any hard bremsstrahlung component. We constrained distances
to this system based upon model fits to the data.

We demonstrate that high-redshift 1-Jansky radio sources are correlated with
foreground IRAS galaxies on angular scales of several 10 arc minutes on a
statistical significance level of up to 99.8\%. Based on a theoretical analysis
published earlier, we propose to interpret these correlations in terms of
gravitational lensing by large- scale structures.

In paper I, we have studied the conditions under which flux tubes are
expelled from adiabatic thick accretion disks. In the present paper, we explore
a few other models of thick disks, where flux tubes could be stored. We show
that flux tubes with sufficiently weak fields are not expelled out if they move
adiabatically inside an isothermal disk; they continue to oscillate around mean
equipotential surfaces inside the disk. If the field in the flux tube is
amplified due to the shear, they are eventually expelled away. We explore a
`toy' model also, where the entropy increase outwards from the center of the
thick disk and find a similar behavior. Flux storage in the disk, as in the
case of the sun, in general, enhances the possibility of sustained magnetic
activity formation of coronae in the chimney region. The existence of coronae
on the disk surface may explain the short-time variability in the spectra of
Blazars and the emission of energetic particles from AGNs and Quasars. It may
also supply matter to the cosmic jets through magnetized winds.

We study the dynamics of toroidal magnetic flux tubes, symmetric about the
rotation axis, inside non-magnetic thick accretion disks around black holes. We
present model equations which include effects of gravity, centrifugal force,
pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, drag, magnetic tension and magnetic
buoyancy. We solve them assuming the disk to be adiabatic. We show that under a
wide range of parameters describing the size and the field strength, as well as
angular momentum distribution inside the disk, buoyant flux tubes, either
released on the equatorial plane or at the outer edge of the disk, can gather
in the chimney-like openings near the axis. This behavior makes the chimneys
magnetically most active and could shed light on the origin and acceleration of
cosmic jets, as well as the variabilities observed in Blazars.

We construct a simple elliptical gravitational lens model for the quadruple
lens B1422+231 and show that the details of the configuration cannot be easily
understood in terms of this model; in particular, the flux ratios of the images
are hard to reproduce. This qualitatively verifies the results from a different
lens model constructed for the same object by Hogg and Blandford.

We have performed the most comprehensive predictions of the temperature
fluctuations \dtt in the primeval isocurvature baryon models to see whether or
not the models are consistent with the recent data on the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies. More specifically, we computed the \dtt corresponding
to the experimental set-up by the South-Pole and the Owens Valley experiments
as well as the COBE satellite. The amplitudes of the predicted \dtt are
normalized by means of the COBE 10$^\circ$ data. The resulting constraints on
the models are presented on $n - \Omega_b$ plane in the case of
$\lambda_0=1-\Omega_b$ (flat models) and $\lambda_0=0$ (open models), where $n$
is the primordial spectral index of entropy fluctuations and $\Omega_b$ is the
present baryon density parameter.
  Our results imply that the PIB models cannot be reconciled with the current
observations for any reasonable set of cosmological parameters.

The clustering in redshift space is studied here to first order within the
framework of gravitational instability. The distortion introduced by the
peculiar velocities of galaxies results in anisotropy in the galaxy
distribution and mode-mode coupling when analyzed in Fourier space. An exact
linear calculation of the full covariance matrix in both the real and Fourier
space is presented here. The explicit dependence on $\Omeg$ and the biasing
parameter is calculated and its potential use as a probe of these parameters is
analyzed. It is shown that Kaiser's formalism can be applied only to a data set
that subtends a small solid angle on the sky, and therefore cannot be used in
the case of all sky surveys. The covariance matrix in the real space is
calculated explicitly for {\it CDM} model, where the behavior along and
perpendicular to the line of sight is shown.

The large scale structure of the universe is reconstructed by means of the
Wiener filter and constrained realizations of Gaussian fields. The density
field constructed from optically selected galaxies (Hudson \cite{Hudson}) has
been sampled out to a distance of $80\hmpc$. This data set is used for the
reconstruction of the underlying primordial perturbation field. A preliminary
reconstruction analysis from the IRAS $1.9Jy$ density field is presented here
for the sake of comparison. The perturbation field within a cube of $160\hmpc$
on the side, centered on the Local Group, and with Gaussian smoothing of length
$10\hmpc$ is reconstructed, assuming the standard CDM model. In particular, the
density field at the Zone of Avoidance is studied. A preliminary maximum
likelihood analysis performed on Hudson's data shows that it is consistent with
a tilted CDM with $n\sim -0.5\pm 0.3$ and $\sigma_8\sim 1.4\pm 0.15$

Relativistic blast wave models predict the spectrum of the emitted
synchrotron radiation. The electrons in the shocked region are heated to a Wien
distribution whose ``temperature'' is $1/3$ of the mean electron energy. This
energy scale determines a characteristic (break) frequency of synchrotron
radiation. At much lower frequencies a spectrum $F_nu \propto \nu^{1/3}$ is
predicted independently of details of the emitting region. This is consistent
with the observed soft X-ray spectra of GRB. It implies low visible and radio
intensities, unless there are collective emission processes.

This paper is intended as part of a more extensive molecular line survey in
star forming regions along the evolutionary track of a collapsing cloud toward
a young stellar object. We have studied a sample of seven small dark clouds
(Bok globules) and eight Herbig Ae/Be stars in the J=1->0 transition of
HCO$^{+}$, H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HCN and H$^{13}$CN. The choice of these molecules
is determined by the simple chemistry and the predicted high abundance of the
reactants leading to their formation. The isotopically substituted species
(isotopomers), H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and H$^{13}$CN, were observed in order to
determine, whenever possible, the optical thickness of the main species. The
most abundant isotopomers were found in almost all the sources (detection rate
70-90\%). Those sources which exhibited the strongest signals were also
searched for the $^{13}$C isotopomers. H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ was found in one dark
cloud and around three Herbig Ae/Be stars, while H$^{13}$CN around only one
star. The column densities for each species and the physical conditions of the
objects were derived whenever the observational data allowed it.

We use high resolution PM N-body simulations to follow the development of
non-linear clustering in a flat Universe, dominated by Cold + Hot Dark Matter
(CHDM) with 60% of CDM, 30% of HDM and 10% of baryons; a simulation box of 100
Mpc a side ($h=0.5$) is used. We analyze two CHDM simulations with $b =1.5$
(COBE normalization). We also compare them with CDM simulations with $b=1.5$
and $b=1$. We evaluate high-order correlation functions and the
void-probability-function (VPF). Correlation functions are obtained both from
counts in cells and counts of neighbors. The analysis is made for DM particles
and for galaxies, identified as massive halos in the evolved density field. We
also check the effects of dynamical evolution and redshift space distortions.
We find that clustering of DM particles exhibits deviations from the
hierarchical scaling, which decrease somewhat in redshift space. Galaxies
follow hierarchical scaling far more closely, with coefficients S_3=2.5 and
S_4=7.5, in general agreement with observational results, just marginally
affected by redshift distortions and on the choices for the initial spectra.
The hierarchical scaling of galaxy clustering is confirmed by the VPF analysis
and in all the cases considered a good agreement with observational results is
obtained.

We investigate asymptotic convergence in the~$\Delta x \!\rightarrow\! 0$
limit as a tool for determining whether numerical computations involving shocks
are accurate. We use one-dimensional operator-split finite-difference schemes
for hydrodynamics with a von Neumann artificial viscosity. An internal-energy
scheme converges to demonstrably wrong solutions. We associate this failure
with the presence of discontinuities in the limiting solution. Our extension of
the Lax-Wendroff theorem guarantees that certain conservative, operator-split
schemes converge to the correct continuum solution. For such a total-energy
scheme applied to the formation of a single shock, convergence of a Cauchy
error approaches the expected rate slowly. We relate this slowness to the
effect of varying diffusion, due to varying linear artificial-viscous length,
on small-amplitude waves. In an appendix we discuss the scaling of
shock-transition regions with viscous lengths, and exhibit several difficulties
for attempts to make extrapolations.

To test whether clusters have rising mass to light ratios at large radii and
to estimate the amplitude of the density fluctuation spectrum on the scale of
10\hmpc\ the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC) cluster
collaboration is obtaining Multi-Object Spectrograph velocities and two colour
photometry for a sample of $\simeq$1000 cluster galaxies and $\simeq$2000 field
galaxies in a 5\hmpc\ neighborhood of high X-ray luminosity clusters at
$z\simeq 0.3$. X-ray selection of the cluster sample picks out objects on the
basis of the depth of their potential well depth, and is insensitive to both
projection effects and galaxy biases. The galaxy dataset, with selection
controlled using automated photometry, automated mask design, spectral
selection modeling, and accurate velocities, will be the best available at any
redshift for our tests. Measuring mass-to-light ratios (M/L) at large radii
requires a statistical removal of field galaxies projected into the redshift
space of the cluster. This can be done relatively accurately for moderate
redshift clusters, using the large number of foreground and background
galaxies. The CNOC sample also provides a sensitive test of the density
fluctuation spectrum on cluster scales. The 30 or so redshifts available in
each of three clusters gives an average velocity dispersion of about 1000 \kms
which indicates that the $\sigma_8$ normalization parameter is in the range of
$0.6\lta \sigma_8\lta 0.9$.

We introduce a formalism to describe 2D-Potentials for 2D-matter (or charge)
distributions with arbitrary elliptical symmetry including varying eccentricity
and twisting of the iso-density curves. We use this approach to describe
elliptical matter distributions such as elliptical galaxies or clusters as
gravitational lenses. Figures are available upon request:
tschramm@hs.uni-hamburg.de

This series of papers comprises a systematic exploration of the hypothesis
that the far ultraviolet radiation from star clusters and elliptical galaxies
originates from extremely hot horizontal-branch (HB) stars and their post-HB
progeny. This first paper presents an extensive grid of calculations of stellar
models from the Zero Age Horizontal Branch through to a point late in post-HB
evolution or a point on the white dwarf cooling track. We use the term `Extreme
Horizontal Branch' (EHB) to refer to HB sequences of constant mass that do not
reach the thermally-pulsing stage on the AGB. These models evolve after core
helium exhaustion

Quashnock and Lamb (1993) defined a sub-sample of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs)
from the publicly available BATSE database which shows clumping toward the
galactic plane, and concluded that all GRBs are galactic in origin. The
selection of these bursts (duplicated in this work in Sample 1) involved a peak
countrate (in counts s-1) uncorrected for aspect. We assert that the peak flux
of a burst is physically more meaningful than peak count-rate. Using, as
limits, the corresponding peak fluxes (in photons cm-2 s-1) for the bursts in
the QL sample, we find an additional 24 bursts, which we include in a new
sample (Sample 2). We find that the significance of anisotropy in Sample 2 is
much less than that of Sample 1, which does not support QL's interpretation of
the anisotropies as being due to a galactic population. To make meaningful
statistical statements regarding isotropy, burst samples must have peak fluxes
above a minimum flux, set by the requirement that a burst be detectable from
any direction (above the horizon) with respect to GRO, at any detection
threshold at which a burst was observed in that sample. We find that a sample
of such bursts has a marginal (2.6 sigma) deviation from isotropy, which we
consider insufficient to justify the claim that GRBs are galactic in origin.

The evolution of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of continuous
density, velocity and velocity derivatives ( deformation tensor) fields in the
theory of cosmological gravitational instability are considered. We show that
in the Newtonian theory the dynamical equations cannot be reduced to the closed
set of Lagrangian equations.
  Since continuous fields from galaxy surveys need sufficiently large smoothing
which exceeds the scale of nonlinearity, one can use the Zel'dovich
approximation to describe the mildly non-linear matter evolution, which allows
the closed set of Lagrangian equations. The closed kinetic equation for the
joint PDF of cosmological continuous fields is derived in this approximation.
  The analytical theory of the cosmological PDFs with arbitrary (including
Gaussian) initial statistics is developed, based on the solution on the kinetic
equaiton. For Gaussian initial fluctuations, the PDFs are parametrized by only
linear {\it rms} fluctuations $\sigma$ on given filtering scale. Density PDF
$P(\rho, t)$ and PDF $M(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3; t)$ of eigenvalues of
the deformation tensor field in the Eulerian space evolve very rapidly in
non-linear regime. On the contrary, velocity PDF $Q(\vec v, t)$ remains
invariant under non-linear evolution. For small $\sigma$ the Edgworth series is
suggested to reconstruct

We study the quasilinear evolution of the one-point probability density
functions (PDFs) of the smoothed density and velocity fields in a cosmological
gravitating system beginning with Gaussian initial fluctuations. Our analytic
results are based on the Zel'dovich approximation and laminar flow. A numerical
analysis extends the results into the multistreaming regime using the smoothed
fields of a CDM N-body simulation. We find that the PDF of velocity, both
Lagrangian and Eulerian, remains Gaussian under the laminar Zel'dovich
approximation, and it is almost indistinguishable from Gaussian in the
simulations. The PDF of mass density deviates from a normal distribution early
in the quasilinear regime and it develops a shape remarkably similar to a
lognormal distribution with one parameter, the \rms density fluctuation
$\sigma$. Applying these results to currently available data we find that the
PDFs of the velocity and density fields, as recovered by the \pot\ procedure
from observed velocities assuming $\Omega=1$, or as deduced from a redshift
survey of \iras\ galaxies assuming that galaxies trace mass, are consistent
with Gaussian initial fluctuations.

We compute the three-point temperature correlation function of the {\it COBE}
Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) first-year sky maps to search for
non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations. The level of fluctuations seen in the
computed correlation function are too large to be attributable solely to
instrument noise. However the fluctuations are consistent with the level
expected to result from a superposition of instrument noise and sky signal
arising from a Gaussian power law model of initial fluctuations, with a
quadrupole normalized amplitude of 17 $\mu$K and a power law spectral index $n
= 1$. We place limits on the amplitude of intrinsic three-point correlations
with a variety of predicted functional forms.

Lo, Sargent, and Young (1993) have recently concluded that the masses of some
dwarf galaxies, as deduced by the modified dynamics (MOND) from the observed
velocity dispersions, are systematically smaller than the observed masses, by a
factor of ten or more. We show here that the MOND mass estimator used by Lo et
al. is smaller than the proper expression, by a factor of about twenty. We
derive the proper mass estimator as an exact virial-like relation between the
3-D rms velocity, Vs, and the total mass, M, of an arbitrary, self-gravitating
system, made of light constituents, that is everywhere in the
very-low-acceleration regime of MOND. This reads M=(9/4)Vs^2/G a0. (For a
system that is not stationary, Vs involves also an average over time.) We
further generalize this relation to cases with constituent masses that are not
small compared with that of the whole system. We discuss various applications
of the M-V relation. With the correct estimator the predictions of MOND are, by
and large, in good agreement with the total observed masses (the observed gas
mass plus a stellar mass corresponding to an M/L of order one solar unit).

The FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite has conducted an unbiased survey
of the far-infrared emission from our Galaxy. The first results of this survey
were reported by Wright et al. (1991). We report the results of new analyses of
this spectral survey, which includes emission lines from 158 um C+, 122 um and
205 um N+, 370 um and 609 um C, and CO J=2-1 through 5-4. We report the
morphological distribution along the galactic plane (b=0) of the spectral line
emission, and the high galactic latitude intensities of the C+ and 205 um N+
emission. The high galactic latitude intensity cosecant of the 158 um fine
structure transition from C+ is presented, and C+ is seen to decrease more
rapidly than the far infrared intensity with increasing galactic latitude. C+
and H I emission are closely correlated with a C+ cooling rate of (2.65 +/-
0.15)x10^{-26} erg/s/H-atom. We conclude that this emission arises almost
entirely from the Cold Neutral Medium. The high galactic latitude intensity of
the 205 um fine structure transition from N+ arises entirely from the Warm
Ionized Medium, and its cosecant is presented. We estimate the total ionizing
photon rate in the Galaxy to be 3.5x10^{53} ionizing photons per second, based
on the 205 um N+ transition.

We present here the Spatial Two--Point Correlation Function for a complete
sample of 67 X--ray selected Abell clusters of galaxies. We find a correlation
length of $16.1\pm3.4\mpc$ with no significant clustering beyond
$\simeq40\mpc$. This is the lowest uncorrected value for the correlation length
ever derived from the Abell catalogue of clusters. In addition, we have
investigated the anisotropy of the correlation function between the radial and
transverse directions. This can be characterised by the magnitude of pair--wise
cluster peculiar velocities such anisotropy predicts, which we find to be
$\simeq800{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ for our sample. Again, this is the lowest
uncorrected value ever seen for the Abell catalogue. We therefore, no longer
need to invoke high cluster peculiar velocities or line of sight clustering to
understand the correlation function as derived from an Abell sample of
clusters. Furthermore, our result is consistent with recently published
correlation functions computed from automated selections of optical and X--ray
clusters. Therefore, we are now approaching a coherent picture for the form of
the cluster spatial correlation function which will be used to place confident
constraints on theories of galaxy formation.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of galactic extinction close to the
south galactic pole and plate--to--plate matching errors. These represent the
most probable systematic errors within the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy
Catalogue (EDSGC) which could affect the angular correlation function. The
distribution of extinction within the EDSGC area was obtained using the Stark
{\it et al.} HI map and the IRAS $100\mu\rm{m}$ flux map. We find that the
amplitude of the whole EDSGC correlation function varies by less than ${\rm
\delta w}=0.003$ for reddening ratios $\rm{R_V}$ in the range
$3.25\rightarrow6$. This corresponds to a range in average extinction of ${\rm
A_B}=0.12\rightarrow0.24$. Simulations were carried out to assess the
contribution to the correlation function from correlated and uncorrelated plate
magnitude errors. The only simulation that affected the large--scale power seen
in \w was for correlated plate errors with a systematic plate--to--plate offset
of ${\rm \Delta m} =0.02$. This represented an overall $0.4$ magnitude
difference between the ends of the EDSGC which was inconsistent with checks
carried out with external photometry. All other simulations had an
insignificant effect on the large--scale form of the correlation function.
These tests suggest that the large--scale power seen in the EDSGC correlation
function is due to intrinsic clustering and is not an artifact of the
construction or location of the catalogue.

Non-static gravitational fields generally introduce frequency shifts when
bending light. In this paper, I discuss the frequency shifts induced in the
bending of light by moving masses. As examples, I treat the recently discovered
high-velocity pulsar PSR 2224+65 and a typical Einstein ring.

I show that the braking index, $N$, a fundamental pulsar experimental
quantity, naturally differs from the canonical value of 3 by terms which
involve mass accretion. Using the measured values of $N$ for PSR1509-58 and
PSR0531+21, I determine that for constant density neutron stars their present
mass accretion rates are $(3.10\pm.51)\times10^{-5}$ M year$^{-1}$ and
$(9.946\pm.089)\times10^{-5}$ M year$^{-1}$ respectively, where M is the mass
of each pulsar. Finally, I demonstrate that mass accretion removes the
outstanding problem of the origin of the big glitches of the Vela Pulsar.

We present redshifts for a sample of 229 clusters selected from the APM
Galaxy Survey, 189 of which are new redshift determinations. Non-cluster galaxy
redshifts have been rejected from this sample using a likelihood ratio test
based on the projected and apparent magnitude distributions of the cluster
fields. We test this technique using cluster fields in which redshifts have
been measured for more than 10 galaxies. Our redshift sample is nearly complete
and has been used in previous papers to study the three dimensional
distribution of rich clusters of galaxies. 157 of the clusters in our sample
are listed in the Abell catalogue or supplement, and the remainder are new
cluster identifications.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies have turned out to
represent one of the most stringent 'bottle necks' for scenarios of large scale
structure formation. As a possibility to relax this constraint, it has been
proposed that early reionization can damp CMB fluctuations on small scales due
to photon diffusion in the ionized plasma. As an example, I investigate the
recently proposed scenario with cold dark matter (CDM) and texture seeds.
There, an analysis of CMB anisotropies shows that early reionization is a
crucial ingredient for this scenario. Without damping, the small scale
anisotropies would dominate and exceed observed limits. In this paper I present
analytical and numerical results for the amount of damping due to early
reionization for CMB perturbations induced by a collapsing texture.
Furthermore, the spectral distortion of the CMB due to Compton scattering of
the hotter plasma electrons is calculated. Next I discuss the physical
processes which lead to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for
the degree of ionization, the electron temperature and the evolution of the
ionizing radiation.

The cosmic microwave anisotropies in a scenario of large scale structure
formation with cold dark matter and texture are discussed and compared with
recent observational results of the COBE satellite. A couple of important
statistical parameters are determined. The fluctuations are slightly non
gaussian. The quadrupole anisotropy is $1.5\pm 1.2\times 10^{-5}$ and the
fluctuations on a angular scale of 10 degrees are $ (3.8\pm 2.6)\times
10^{-5}$. The COBE are within about one standard deviation of the typical
texture + CDM model discussed in this paper. Furthermore, we calculate
fluctuations on intermediate scales (about 2 degrees) with the result $\De
T/T(\theta \sim 2^o) = 3.9\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$. Collapsing textures are
modeled by spherically symmetric field configurations. This leads to
uncertainties of about a factor of~2.

After an introduction to the problem of cosmological structure formation, we
develop gauge invariant cosmological perturbation theory. We derive the first
order perturbation equations of Einstein's equations and energy momentum
``conservation''. Furthermore, the perturbations of Liouville's equation for
collisionless particles and Boltzmann's equation for Compton scattering are
worked out. We fully discuss the propagation of photons in a perturbed
Friedmann universe, calculating the Sachs--Wolfe effect and light deflection.
The perturbation equations are extended to accommodate also perturbations
induced by seeds.
  With these general results we discuss some of the main aspects of the texture
model for the formation of large scale structure in the
  Universe (galaxies, clusters, sheets, voids).
  In this model, perturbations in the dark matter are induced by texture seeds.
  The gravitational effects of a spherically symmetric collapsing texture on
dark matter, baryonic matter and photons are calculated in first order
perturbation theory. We study the characteristic signature of the microwave
background fluctuations induced in this scenario and compare it with the COBE
observations.

The abundance and internal characteristics of rich clusters of galaxies can
provide useful constraints on models of large--scale structure formation. This
article will review some recent three dimensional, multi--fluid simulations of
cluster dynamics and discuss their impact on issues raised from optical and
X-ray observations of clusters. In `bottom--up' formation scenarios (such as
the ubiquitous cold dark matter model), galaxies form before rich clusters;
hence, cluster formation is intimately linked to galaxy formation which, in
turn, is tied to star formation. I will examine two issues which appear
relatively insensitive to galaxy/star formation --- the baryon fraction in
clusters and the connection between X--ray morphology and $\Omega_o$ --- and
end with a topic that is intimately linked to it --- dynamical biases in the
cluster galaxy population.

Based on dynamical constraints about the Hubble sequence evolution,
observational data and a number of "conspiracies", we propose that the dark
matter around spiral galaxies is in the form of cold gas, essentially in
molecular form and rotationally supported. (full A&A paper (in press) available

Gas cloud models taking into account the recently disclosed fractal structure
of cold gas are set up, showing that large errors in the classical gas mass
determination based on smooth cloud models can easily follow if the gas is in
reality fractal. Fractal clouds must present both optically thin and optically
thick clumps in any single wavelength observations. The observed fractal
dimension of the cold ISM suggests that mass underestimates by a factor 10 or
more are typical. Due to its low temperature (around 3 K), and its condensed
fractal structure, together with its low metallicity, the outer gas would be
almost invisible for usual detectors. (A&A paper (in press) and figures

It has been shown by Paczy\'nski that gravitational microlensing is
potentially a useful method for detecting the dark constituents of the halo of
our galaxy, if their mass lies in the approximate domain
$10^{-6}<M/M_\odot<10^{-1}$. Microlensing observations now im progress monitor
several millions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and in the Galactic
Bulge. Here I discuss the main features of the microlensing events: in
particular their rates and probability.

the main features of the microlensing events: in particular their rates and
probability, taking also into account a possible flattened shaper for the halo.

It has been shown by Paczy\'nski that gravitational microlensing is a useful
method to detect brown dwarfs in the dark halo of our galaxy. At present
several experiments are carried out to monitor several million stars in the
Large Magellanic Cloud with the aim to find such microlensing events. Here I
discuss the possibility to use as targets stars in the Andromeda galaxy. Such
an experiment would be sensitive to both the brown dwarfs in our halo and in
the one of M31. The optical depth $\tau$ to gravitational microlensing due to
brown dwarfs in the halo of M31 turns out to be $\sim 10^{-6}$, which is
comparable to the value of $\tau$ for our own halo. I also compute the
microlensing rate and the average lensing duration and consider moreover the
dependence of $\tau$ on the shape of the halo.

We consider a cosmic ray spectrum that is a power law in momentum down to a
cutoff and derive a lower cutoff corresponding to $E_{kin} \sim (30-60)$ MeV
from the observed ionization rates in nearby diffuse clouds. While the real
spectra of cosmic rays may not be so simple, we argue that one expects a
substantial change in the spectra at such energies and that, at first
approximation, a power law spectra with a lower cutoff is appropriate. Such a
description of the cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is not only
theoretically more attractive than the spectra used in the literature, but is
also supported by recent observations.

Contains a summary, current status and prospects for the direct detection of
cold dark matter using diurnal modulation effects as presented at the ELAF 93,
Mar del Plata Argentina. The potential advantages of using the Earth as an
absorber to produce diurnal modulation effects in cold dark matter searches are
given along with some estimates of counting rates.

A simple test for time-asymmetry is devised and carried out on the brightest
gamma-ray bursts detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE)
on board the {\it Compton} Gamma Ray Observatory. We show evidence that
individual bursts are time-asymmetric on all time scales tested, from a time
scale shorter than that of pulses which compose GRBs to a time scale similar to
a greater envelope that contains these pulses. We also find bursts which
manifest significant asymmetry only on time scales comparable to the duration
of burst, and bursts for which no clear asymmetry on any time scale is present.
The sense of the asymmetry is that bursts and/or component structures rise in a
shorter time than they decay. We also find that our whole sample of bursts
taken together is time- asymmetric, in that there are significantly more bursts
and pulses where the rise is more rapid than the decay, on all time scales
tested and for all energy bands tested. When our whole GRB sample is binned at
64-ms and integrated over all BATSE energies, the statistical significance is
at the 6 $\sigma$ level. Models that predict time-symmetry are therefore
excluded.

We review how the various large-scale data constrain cosmological parameters
and, consequently, theories for the origin of large-scale structure in the
Universe. We discuss the form of the power spectrum implied by the correlation
data of galaxies and argue by comparing the velocity field implied by the
distribution of light with the observed velocity flows that the bias parameter,
$b$, is likely to be constant in the linear regime. This then allows one to
estimate the density parameter, $\Omega$, and $b$ directly from the
\underline{data} on $\xi(r)$ and the velocity fields. We show that it is
consistent with low values of $\Omega^{0.6}/b$. We discuss the ways to
normalise the optical data at $z\sim0$ directly to the COBE (or other microwave
background) data. The data on high-$z$ \underline{galaxies} allows one to
further constrain the shape of the \underline{primordial} power spectrum at
scales which are non-linear today ($< 8h^{-1}$Mpc) and we discuss the
consistency of the data with inflationary models normalised to the large-scale
structure observations.

We challenge a widely accepted assumption of observational cosmology: that
successful reconstruction of observed galaxy density fields from measured
galaxy velocity fields (or vice versa), using the methods of gravitational
instability theory, implies that the observed large-scale structures and
large-scale flows were produced by the action of gravity. This assumption is
false, in that there exist non-gravitational theories that pass the
reconstruction tests and gravitational theories with certain forms of biased
galaxy formation that fail them. Gravitational instability theory predicts
specific correlations between large-scale velocity and mass density fields, but
the same correlations arise in any model where (a) structures in the galaxy
distribution grow from homogeneous initial conditions in a way that satisfies
the continuity equation, and (b) the present-day velocity field is irrotational
and proportional to the time-averaged velocity field. We demonstrate these
assertions using analytical arguments and N-body simulations of gravitational
and non-gravitational models. We also show examples of gravitational and
non-gravitational models that {\it fail} reconstruction tests because galaxy
formation is modulated (``biased'') in a way that violates the continuity
equation. We discuss the relation between the value of $\Omega$ inferred from
velocity-density comparisons and the true cosmological value.

A formalism is presented that allows cosmological experiments to be tested
for consistency, and allows a simple frequentist interpretation of the
resulting significance levels. As an example of an application, this formalism
is used to place constraints on bulk flows of galaxies using the results of the
microwave background anisotropy experiments COBE and SP91, and a few
simplifying approximations about the experimental window functions. It is found
that if taken at face value, with the quoted errors, the recent detection by
Lauer and Postman of a bulk flow of 689 km/s on scales of 150$h^{-1}$Mpc is
inconsistent with SP91 at a 95\% confidence level within the framework of a
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. The same consistency test is also used to place
constraints that are completely model-independent, in the sense that they hold
for any power spectrum whatsoever --- the only assumption being that the random
fields are Gaussian. It is shown that the resulting infinite-dimensional
optimization problem reduces to a set of coupled non-linear equations that can
readily be solved numerically. Applying this technique to the above-mentioned
example, we find that the Lauer and Postman result is inconsistent with SP91
even if no assumptions whatsoever are made about the power spectrum.

Abbreviated abstract of an invited talk at the International Cosmic Ray
Conference in Calgary, July 1993: The results from the COBE satellite are in
close agreement with the predictions of the standard hot Big Bang model,
suggesting that the Universe was once hot, dense and isothermal, giving a
background radiation spectrum that is close to a perfect blackbody. The
spectrum observed by the FIRAS instrument places strong limits on events and
scenarios occurring later than 1 year after the Big Bang. The observation of
intrinsic anisotropy of the microwave background by the DMR instrument provides
a measurement of the magnitude of the gravitational potential fluctuations that
existed at decoupling. These potential perturbations were either produced in an
inflationary epoch, or else they are initial conditions dating from t = 0. The
angular power spectrum of dT is compatible with the inflationary scenario. The
observed amplitude of dT can be used to restrict theories of the fundamental
structure of matter on micro-physical scales and at energies higher than that
of the most energetic cosmic rays. The DIRBE instrument will provide greatly
improved data on extragalactic IR backgrounds after the strong foreground
emission is subtracted.

Nonlinear approximation methods such as the Zeldovich approximation, and more
recently the frozen flow and linear potential approximations, are sometimes
used to simulate nonlinear gravitational instability in the expanding Universe.
We investigate the relative accuracy of these approximations by comparing them
with the exact solution using second order perturbation theory. We evaluate the
density and velocity fields in these approximations to second order, and also
determine the skewness parameter $S_3 = \langle \delta^3 \rangle / \langle
(\delta^{(1)})^2\rangle ^2$ for each of the approximations again in second
order. We find that $S_3 = 4, ~3, ~3.4$ for the Zeldovich approximation, the
frozen flow and the linear potential approximations respectively as compared to
$S_3 = {34/7}$ for the exact solution. Our results show that, of all the
approximations considered, the Zeldovich approximation is the most accurate in
describing the weakly nonlinear effects of gravity. Moreover, the Zeldovich
approximation is much closer to the exact results for matter and velocity
distributions than the other approximations if the slope of the power spectrum
of density perturbations is $-3< n \le -1$.

We describe an attempt to reconstruct the initial conditions for the
formation of cosmological large-scale structure. The power spectrum of the
primordial fluctuations is affected by bias, nonlinear evolution and
redshift-space distortions, but we show how these effects can be corrected for
analytically. Using eight independent datasets, we obtain excellent agreement
in the estimated linear power spectra given the following conditions. First,
the relative bias factors for Abell clusters, radio galaxies, optical galaxies
and IRAS galaxies must be in the ratios 4.5:1.9:1.3:1. Second, the data require
redshift-space distortion: $\Omega^{0.6}/b_{\ss I}
  = 1.0 \pm 0.2$. Third, low values of $\Omega$ and bias are disfavoured. The
shape of the spectrum is extremely well described by a CDM transfer function
with an apparent value of the fitting parameter $\Omega h =0.25$. Tilted models
predict too little power at 100 Mpc wavelengths.

We demonstrate that band-structure effects suppress bremsstrahlung of
neutrino pairs by electrons in the crusts of neutron stars at temperatures of
the order of $5\times 10^9 \,{\rm K}$ and below. Taking this into account,
together with the fact that recent work indicates that the masses of neutron
star crusts are considerably smaller than previously estimated, we find
neutrino pair bremsstrahlung to be much less important for the thermal
evolution of neutron stars than earlier calculations suggested.

The analysis of whole-sky galaxy surveys commonly suffers from the problems
of shot-noise and incomplete sky coverage (e.g. at the Zone of Avoidance). The
orthogonal set of spherical harmonics is utilized here to expand the observed
galaxy distribution. We show that in the framework of Bayesian statistics and
Gaussian random fields the $4 \pi$ harmonics can be recovered and the
shot-noise can be removed, giving the most probable picture of the underlying
density field. The correction factor from observed to reconstructed harmonics
turns out to be the well-known Wiener filter (the ratio of signal to
signal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum variance. We apply
the method to the projected 1.2 Jy IRAS survey. The reconstruction confirms the
connectivity of the Supergalactic Plane across the Galactic Plane (at Galactic
longitude $l \sim 135^o$ and $l \sim 315^o$) and the Puppis cluster behind the
Galactic Plane ($ l \sim 240^o$). The method can be extended to 3-D in both
real and redshift space, and applied to other cosmic phenomena such as the COBE
Microwave Background maps.

Use of the brightest stars in galaxies as a distance indicator and claims
that the method supports the `short' distance scale are examined. Data from
several different observational programmes are brought together for the first
time with a procedure for the careful accounting of errors. The true
uncertainties of the method are found to be much larger than claimed by its
advocates. The method is incapable of distinguishing between the `long' and
`short' distance scales.

Previous comparisons of optical and X-ray observations of clusters of
galaxies have lead to the so-called ``$\beta$ - discrepancy'' that has
persisted for the last decade. The standard hydrostatic-isothermal model for
clusters predicts that the parameter $\beta_{spec} = \sigma_{r}^{2}/(kT/\mu
m_{p})$, which describes the ratio of energy per unit mass in galaxies to that
in the gas, should equal the parameter $\beta_{fit}$ (where $\rho_{gas}(r)
\propto \rho_{gal}(r)^{\beta_{fit}}$) determined from the X-ray surface
brightness distribution. The observations suggest an apparent discrepancy :
$\beta_{spec} \sim 1.2$ (i.e., the galaxies are ``hotter'' than the gas) while
$\beta_{fit} \sim 0.65$ (i.e., the gas is ``hotter'' and more extended than the
galaxies). Here we show that the discrepancy is resolved when the actual
observed galaxy distribution in clusters is used, $\rho_{gal}(r) \propto
r^{-2.4 \pm 0.2}$, instead of the previously assumed steeper King
approximation, $\rho_{gal}(r) \propto r^{-3}$. Using a large sample of
clusters, we find best-fit mean values of $\beta_{spec} = 0.94 \pm 0.08$ and
$\beta_{fit}^{corrected} = 1.25 \times \beta_{fit} = 0.84 \pm 0.10$. These
results resolve the $\beta$ - discrepancy and provide support for the
hydrostatic cluster model.

To try and confirm the types of object in the list of 2298 potential HII
regions identified by Hughes \& MacLeod from the IRAS Point Source Catalog, we
selected a sample of 82 for observing at the VLA. We selected half with values
of Y = log(F$_{25}$/F$_{12}$) $\geq$ 0.8, and for control purposes, half with
values of 0.3 $\leq$ log(F$_{25}$/F$_{12}$) $\leq$ 0.5. 78 radio sources were
detected, and of all the objects, 72\% had at least one associated radio
source. Most of the radio sources had diameters of $<$ 3\arcsec, which was the
limit to the angular resolving power of the survey. Those with larger values of
Y had significantly larger values of peak radio, integrated radio, and
100$\mu$m flux densities than those with smaller Y. Also, they generally had
associated masers, and thus were most likely young compact HII regions
containing star forming regions. Those with smaller Y tended not to have
associated maser activity and are probably older HII regions, or stars with
high IR and ionizing radiation, such as T-Tauri type stars. However, all 2298
objects appear to have a strong galactic concentration. Some comparison is made
with the selection of 1717 objects identified by Wood \& Churchwell as HII
regions, but their selection criteria were somewhat different, and they
actually form a subset of ours.

The oxygen abundances in the \HII regions of a sample of low surface
brightness (LSB) disk galaxies are presented. In general, LSB galaxies are
found to be metal poor ($Z < {1 \over 3} Z\solar$). Indeed, some LSB galaxies
rival the lowest abundance extragalactic objects known. These low metallicities
indicate that LSB galaxies evolve slowly, forming relatively few stars over a
Hubble time.
  The low metallicities of LSB galaxies occur even though many are comparable
in size and mass to the prominent spirals which define the Hubble sequence. As
well as being low in surface brightness, these galaxies tend to be isolated.
This suggests that surface mass density and environment are more relevant to
galaxy evolution than gross size.
  Despite the low surface brightness of the disks, massive ($M > 60 M\solar$)
stars are inferred to be present and no abnormality of the IMF is indicated.
Many low excitation \HII regions exist at low metallicity in LSB galaxies, and
the ionization parameter is not tightly correlated with metallicity. However,
there does seem to be a significant envelope of maximum ionization at a given
metallicity.

It is suggested that a significant fraction of the low column-density
absorption features seen in the spectra of quasars are produced in
pressure-confined tidal debris, that was built up in small groups and clusters
of galaxies over a Hubble time. We show that the space-density and
cross-section of tidal tails in groups of galaxies are large enough that they
could constitute a major source of the low redshift Ly$\alpha$ absorption
features that are associated with galaxies. The space-density of groups within
10 Mpc of our galaxy is found to be 2.4 $\times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which is
close to the $\sim 6 \times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ space-density calculated for
Ly$\alpha$ absorbers, assuming they have a 1 Mpc radius. Other observational
constraints on the properties of Ly$\alpha$ absorber such as their velocity
dispersion, correlation properties, dimensions and abundances, are shown to be
consistent with this hypothesis.

In this paper I consider the nonlinear evolution of a rare density
fluctuation in a random density field with Gaussian fluctuations, and I
rigorously show that it follows the spherical collapse dynamics applied to its
mean initial profile. This result is valid for any cosmological model and is
independent of the shape of the power spectrum. In the early stages of the
dynamics the density contrast of the fluctuation is seen to follow with a good
accuracy the form $$\delta=(1-\delta_L/1.5)^{-1.5}-1,$$ where $\delta_L$ is the
linearly extrapolated overdensity. I then investigate the validity domain of
the rare event approximation in terms of the parameter $\nu=\delta_L/\sigma$
giving the initial overdensity scaled by the rms fluctuation at the same mass
scale, and find that it depends critically on the shape of the power spectrum.
When the power law index $n$ is lower than $-1$ the departure from the
spherical collapse is expected to be small, at least in the early stages of the
dynamics, and even for moderate values of $\nu$ ($\vert\nu\vert\ge 2$).
However, for $n\ge -1$ and whatever the value of $\nu$, the dynamics seems to
be dominated by the small--scale fluctuations and the subsequent evolution of
the peak may not be necessarily correlated to its initial overdensity. I
discuss the implications of these results for the nonlinear dynamics and the
formation of astrophysical objects.

Geometric characteristics of random fields are exploited to test the
consistency of density perturbation model spectra with COBE data. These CMB
maps are analyzed using the number of anisotropy hot spots and their boundary
curvature. CMB maps which account for instrumental effects and sky coverage are
Monte Carlo generated. These simulations show that a scale invariant
Harrison-Zeldovich primordial Gaussian density fluctuation spectrum is
consistent with the data. The CMB fluctuation coherence angle, based on
boundary curvature, gives a spectral index n = 1.2 +- 0.3.

A phenomenological power spectrum of primordial density perturbations has
been constructed by using both COBE data to probe the large wavelength region,
and a double power law, locally deduced from galaxy catalogs, which describes
the matter correlation function up to tens of Megaparsec. The shape of the
spectrum P(k) of density fluctuations exhibits a peak that singles out a
characteristic wavelength proportional to the cutoff radius R0 in the matter
distribution (comparable to the distance at which matter becomes
anticorrelated). {}From a least squares fit to COBE's angular correlation
function we obtain R0 = 35 +- 12 Mpc/h for the correlation length, and n = 0.76
+- 0.3 for the spectral index of P(k) in the large wavelength region. The
inferred scale in the spectrum is 51 +- 18 Mpc/h. This number agrees with that
derived from the analysis of the correlation function of matter and with a
preferred scale identified in IRAS PSC.

The Eulerian cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear
mode coupling of density fluctuations. We evaluate the second-order power
spectrum including all four-point contributions. In the weakly nonlinear regime
we find that the dominant nonlinear contribution for realistic cosmological
spectra is made by the coupling of long-wave modes and is well estimated by
second order perturbation theory. For a linear spectrum like that of the cold
dark matter model, second order effects cause a significant enhancement of the
high $k$ part of the spectrum and a slight suppression at low $k$ near the peak
of the spectrum. Our perturbative results agree well in the quasilinear regime
with the nonlinear spectrum from high-resolution N-body simulations.
  We find that due to the long-wave mode coupling, characteristic nonlinear
masses grow less slowly in time (i.e., are larger at higher redshifts) than
would be estimated using the linear power spectrum. For the cold dark matter
model at $(1+z)=(20,10,5,2)$ the nonlinear mass is about $(180,8,2.5,1.6)$
times (respectively) larger than a linear extrapolation would indicate, if the
condition rms $\delta\rho/\rho =1$ is used to define the nonlinear scale. At
high redshift the Press-Schechter mass distribution significantly
underestimates the abundance of high-mass objects for the cold dark matter
model. Although the quantitative results depend on the definition of the
nonlinear scale, these basic consequences hold for any initial spectrum whose
post-recombination spectral index $n$ decreases sufficiently rapidly with
increasing $k$, a feature which arises quite generally during the transition
from a radiation- to matter-dominated universe.

We calculate the spectrum of blast wave models of gamma-ray burst sources,
for various assumptions about the magnetic field density and the relativistic
particle acceleration efficiency. For a range of physically plausible models we
find that the radiation efficiency is high, and leads to nonthermal spectra
with breaks at various energies comparable to those observed in the gamma-ray
range. Radiation is also predicted at other wavebands, in particular at X-ray,
optical/UV and GeV/TeV energies. We discuss the spectra as a function of
duration for three basic types of models, and for cosmological, halo and
galactic disk distances. We also evaluate the gamma-ray fluences and the
spectral characteristics for a range of external densities. Impulsive burst
models at cosmological distances can satisfy the conventional X-ray paucity
constraint $S_x/S_\gamma \siml$ few percent over a wide range of durations, but
galactic models can do so only for bursts shorter than a few seconds, unless
additional assumptions are made. The emissivity is generally larger for bursts
in a denser external environment, with the efficiency increasing up to the
point where all the energy input is radiated away.

We use the POTENT reconstruction of the mass density field in the nearby
universe to estimate the amplitude of the density fluctuation power spectrum
for various cosmological models. We find sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.6}=
1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}, almost independently of the power spectrum. This value
agrees well with the COBE normalization for the standard CDM model, while some
alternative models predict an excessive amplitude compared with COBE. Flat low
\Omega_m models and tilted models with spectral index n<0.8 are particularly
discordant.

(shortened for babbage) We describe (1) a new test for dark matter and
alternate theories of gravitation based on the relative geometries of the X-ray
and optical surface brightness distributions and an assumed form for the
potential of the optical light, (2) a technique to measure the shapes of the
total gravitating matter and dark matter of an ellipsoidal system which is
insensitive to the precise value of the temperature of the gas and to modest
temperature gradients, and (3) a method to determine the ratio of dark mass to
stellar mass that is dependent on the functional forms for the visible star,
gas and dark matter distributions, but independent of the distance to the
galaxy or the gas temperature. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the
ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) of the optically-flattened
elliptical galaxy NGC 720. The X-ray isophotes are significantly elongated,
$\epsilon = 0.20 - 0.30$ (90% confidence) for semi-major axis $a\sim
100\arcsec$. The major axes of the optical and X-ray isophotes are misaligned
by $\sim 30\deg \pm 15\deg$ (90% confidence). We conclude that matter
distributed like the optical light cannot produce the observed ellipticities of
the X-ray isophotes independent of the gas pressure, the gas temperature, and
the value of the stellar mass.

{}From the lensing properties of a numerically simulated cluster, from the
statistical properties of the giant arcs produced by the cluster, and from
comparing the cluster properties derived both from lensing and from the X-ray
properties of the intracluster gas, we conclude (1) that clusters may be
significantly more efficient for lensing than estimated from their velocity
dispersion on the basis of iso- thermal-sphere models, (2) that the discrepancy
between cluster core radii derived from lensing and from their X-ray surface
brightness may be understood assuming that the intracluster gas was expelled
from the cluster galaxies when the dark `body' of the cluster had already
formed, and (3) that clusters may be efficient in producing giant arcs even if
they have extended cores and a fairly shallow sur- face-density profile. This
may mean that arcs may be much easier to produce, and therefore more abundant,
than previously estimated.

We quantitatively compare a particle implementation of the adhesion
approximation to fully non--linear, numerical nbody simulations. Our primary
tool, cross--correlation of nbody simulations with the adhesion approximation,
indicates good agreement, better than that found by the same test performed
with the Zel'dovich approximation (hereafter ZA). However, the
cross--correlation is not as good as that of the truncated Zel'dovich
approximation (TZA), obtained by applying the Zel'dovich approximation after
smoothing the initial density field with a Gaussian filter. We confirm that the
adhesion approximation produces an excessively filamentary distribution.
Relative to the nbody results, we also find that: (a) the power spectrum
obtained from the adhesion approximation is more accurate than that from ZA or
TZA, (b) the error in the phase angle of Fourier components is worse than that
from TZA, and (c) the mass distribution function is more accurate than that
from ZA or TZA. It appears that adhesion performs well statistically, but that
TZA is more accurate dynamically, in the sense of moving mass to the right
place.

We present in this paper a quantitative method for defining void size in
large-scale structure based on percolation threshold density. Beginning with
two-dimensional gravitational clustering simulations smoothed to the threshold
of nonlinearity, we perform percolation analysis to determine the large scale
structure. The resulting objective definition of voids has a natural scaling
property, is topologically interesting, and can be applied immediately to
redshift surveys.

A gravitational lens model of the radio quasar B1422+231 is presented which
can account for the image arrangement and approximately for the relative
magnifications. The locations of the principal lensing mass and a more distant
secondary mass concentration were predicted and subsequently luminous galaxies
were found at these locations. This argues against the existence of substantial
numbers of ``dark'' galaxies. The model suggests that if the compact radio
source is intrinsically superluminal then the observed component motions may be
as large as ~100c with image B moving in the opposite direction to images A and
C. The prospects for a measuring the Hubble constant from a model incorporating
lens galaxy locations, compact radio source expansion speeds and radio time
delays, if and when these are measured, are briefly assessed.

This letter presents results of new high resolution $\Omega=1$ Cold + Hot
Dark Matter (CHDM) and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations. Properties of groups
in these simulations reflect the lower small-scale velocities and the greater
tendency to form distinct filaments on both small and large scales in CHDM as
compared to CDM. The fraction of galaxies in groups and the median group rms
velocity are found to be powerful discriminators between models. We combine
these two features into a very robust statistic, median group rms velocity
$v_{\rm gr}(f_{\rm gr})$ as a function of the fraction $f_{\rm gr}$ of galaxies
in groups. Using this statistic, we compare ``observed'' simulations to CfA
data in redshift space in a careful and consistent way. We find that CHDM
remains a promising model, with for example $v_{\rmgr}(0.45) \approx 125 \pm 25
\kms$ in agreement with the CfA data, while CDM with bias b=1.0
(COBE-compatible) or b=1.5, both giving $v_{\rm gr}(0.45) \approx 400 \pm 25
\kms$, can be virtually ruled out. Using median $M/L$, the observed value of
$\Omega$ is $0.10$ (CHDM) to $0.38$ (CDM).

The four operating solar neutrino experiments confirm the hypothesis that the
energy source for solar luminosity is hydrogen fusion. However, the measured
rate for each of the four solar neutrino experiments differs significantly (by
factors of 2.0 to 3.5) from the corresponding theoretical prediction that is
based upon the standard solar model and the simplest version of the standard
electroweak theory. If standard electroweak theory is correct, the energy
spectrum for \b8 neutrinos created in the solar interior must be the same (to
one part in $10^5$) as the known laboratory \b8 neutrino energy spectrum.
Direct comparison of the chlorine and the Kamiokande experiments, both
sensitive to \b8 neutrinos, suggests that the discrepancy between theory and
observations depends upon neutrino energy, in conflict with standard
expectations. Monte Carlo studies with 1000 implementations of the standard
solar model confirm that the chlorine and the Kamiokande experiments cannot be
reconciled unless new weak interaction physics changes the shape of the \b8
neutrino energy spectrum. The results of the two gallium solar neutrino
experiments strengthen the conclusion that new physics is required and help
determine a relatively small allowed region for the MSW neutrino parameters.

COBE has provided us with a whole-sky map of the CBR anisotropies. However,
even if the noise level is negligible when the four year COBE data are
available, the cosmic variance will prevent us from obtaining information about
the Gaussian nature of the primordial fluctuations. This important issue is
addressed here by studying the angular bispectrum of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies. A general form of the angular bispectrum is given and
the cosmic variance of the angular bispectrum for Gaussian fluctuations is
calculated. The advantage of using the angular bispectrum is that one can
choose to use the multipole moments which minimize the cosmic variance term.
The non-Gaussian signals in most physically motivated non-Gaussian models are
small compared with cosmic variance. Unless the amplitudes are large, the
non-Gaussian signals are only detectable in the COBE data in those models where
the angular bispectrum is flat or increases with increasing multipole moment.

We show how to simulate the clustering of rich clusters of galaxies using a
technique based on the Zel'dovich approximation. This method well reproduces
the spatial distribution of clusters obtainable from full N-body simulations at
a fraction of the computational cost. We use an ensemble of large--scale
simulations to assess the level and statistical significance of cluster
clustering in open, tilted and flat versions of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
model, as well as a model comprising a mixture of Cold and Hot Dark Matter
(CHDM). We find the open and flat CDM models are excluded by the data. The
tilted CDM model with a slight tilt is in marginal agreement, while larger tilt
produces the right amount of clustering; CHDM is the best of all our models at
reproducing the observations of cluster clustering. We find that {\em all} our
models display a systematically weaker relationship between clustering length
and mean cluster separation than seems to be implied by observations. We also
note that the cluster bias factor, is not constant in any of the models,
showing that one needs to be very careful when relating cluster clustering
statistics to primordial density fluctuations.

The time-dependent spectral profile of a resonance line in a homogeneous
expanding medium is studied by numerically solving an improved Fokker-Planck
diffusion equation. The solutions are used to determine the time required to
reach a quasi-static solution near the line center. A simple scaling law for
this relaxation time is derived and is fitted to the numerical results. The
results are applied to the case of Lyman alpha scattering during primordial
recombination of hydrogen. For a wide range of cosmological models it is found
that the relaxation times are smaller than the recombination timescale,
although not by a very large factor. Thus the standard assumption of a
quasi-static solution in cosmological recombination calculations is reasonably
valid, and should not cause substantial errors in the solutions.

This paper covers the material of our two talks. We describe a series of
projects based upon perturbative expansions to follow the gravitational
evolution of the one point probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the
density contrast field and for the divergence of the corresponding velocity
field. The Edgeworth expansion greatly simplifies the problem. Indeed, the PDF
can be described through several low order moments, with the first non-trivial
contribution coming from the skewness, or third moment. Gaussian initial
conditions imply that the skewness of the smoothed density field is
proportional to the square of the variance. The constant of proportionality is
then a function of the logarithmic slope of the variance versus scale, and is
otherwise independent of scale. This constant is also practically independent
of the density parameter $\Omega$, and has very nearly the same value when
distances are estimated by redshifts. To show the latter property, we also
briefly discuss our Lagrangian approach to perturbation theory. Finally, the
observed skewness does depend, of course, on the relation between the
distribution of light and mass; we describe the case of local biasing. For the
divergence of the velocity field, the skewness of its PDF is also proportional
to the square of its variance, but the ratio now strongly depends on the value
of $\Omega$. This offers a new method to determine the density parameter which
does not involve comparisons

We describe a project of brown dwarf detection in the dark halo of a galaxy
using the microlensing effect. We argue that monitoring pixels instead of stars
could provide an enhancement in the number of detectable events. We estimate
the detection efficiency with a Monte-Carlo simulation. We expect a ten-fold
increase with respect to current experiments. To assess the feasibility of this
method we have determined the photometric precision of a pixel by comparing
several pictures of a same field in the
  LMC. To be published in the Proceeding of the workshop 'The dark side of the
universe...', Roma, Juin 1993,

We present first results concerning the metallicities and stellar populations
of galaxies formed in a cosmologically motivated simulation. The calculations
include dark matter, gas dynamics, radiation processes, star formation,
supernovae feedback, and metal enrichment. A rotating, overdense sphere with a
mass of $8\,10^{11}\,$\Msol\ serves as initial model. Converging and Jeans
unstable regions are allowed to form stars, which get their metallicity from
the gas they are formed from. Via supernovae, metal enriched gas is given back
to the interstellar medium. The forming galaxy shows the main properties of
spiral galaxies: A metal rich bulge, a metal poor stellar halo and a disk of
nearly solar composition. Halo and bulge consist predominantly of old stars
($>10.5\,$Gyrs). The disk has a metallicity gradient of $\dd(\log Z) / \dd r =
- 0.05\,$kpc$^{-1}$, whereas the halo shows none. The models also exhibit a
correlation between the metallicity of Pop~II stars and the power of small
scale fluctuations. The stars of the bulge form from gas which is initially
located in the largest maxima of the primordial density fluctuations, whereas
the halo stars originate from gas accumulated in less pronounced maxima.

The flat rotation curve obtained for the outer star clusters of the Large
Magellanic Cloud is suggestive of an LMC dark matter halo. From the composite
HI and star cluster rotation curve, I estimate the parameters of an isothermal
dark matter halo added to a `maximum disk.' I then examine the possibility of
detecting high energy gamma-rays from non-baryonic dark matter annihilations in
the central region of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

The position angles of a large number of Abell and Shectman clusters (in
total 637 clusters), identified in the Lick map as surface density
enhancements, are estimated. Using published redshifts for 277 of these I have
detected strong nearest neighbour alignments (2.5 - 3 sigma level), up to about
15 Mpc (Ho = 100). Weaker alignments but still significant are found up to
larger separations. An even more significant alignment (4 sigma) is found
between all neighbours residing in superclusters and having separations <= 10
Mpc. Again weaker but significant alignments are found when larger separations
are considered. I have performed various tests to check whether systematic
effects could induce an artificial alignment signal but I find no evidence for
the presence of such effects. Since my cluster sample is neither volume limited
nor redshift complete, a fact that would tend to wash-out any real alignment
signal, the alignments detected should reflect a real and possibly a stronger
underline effect.

Davidsen et al. (1991) have argued that the failure to detect uv photons from
the dark matter DM) in cluster A665 excludes the decaying neutrino hypothesis.
Sciama et al. (1993) argued that because of high central concentration the DM
in that cluster must be baryonic. We study the DM profile in clusters of
galaxies simulated using the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum of density
fluctuations, and an amplitude previously derived from numerical simulations
(Melott 1984b; Anninos et al. 1991) and in agreement with microwave background
fluctuations (Smoot et al. 1992). We find that with this amplitude
normalization cluster neutrino DM densities are comparable to observed cluster
DM values. We conclude that given this normalization, the cluster DM should be
at least largely composed of neutrinos. The constraint of Davidsen et al. can
be somewhat weakened by the presence of baryonic DM; but it cannot be
eliminated given our assumptions.

One dimensional, convective, vertical structure models and one dimensional,
time dependent, radial diffusion models are combined to create a
self-consistent picture in which FU~Orionis outbursts occur in young stellar
objects (YSOs) as the result of a large scale, self-regulated, thermal
ionization instability in the surrounding protostellar accretion disk. By
fitting the results of time dependent disk models to observed time scales of
FU~Orionis events, we estimate the magnitude of the effeciency of the effective
viscous stress in the inner disk (r < 1 AU) to be, in accordance with the ad
hoc ``alpha'' prescription, 10^{-4} where hydrogen is neutral and 10^{-3} where
hydrogen is ionized. We hypothesize that all YSOs receive infall onto their
outer disks which is steady (or slowly declining with time) and that FU~Orionis
outbursts are self-regulated, disk outbursts which occur only in systems which
transport matter inward at a rate sufficiently high to cause hydrogen to be
ionized in the inner disk. We estimate a critical mass flux of 5x10^{-7} solar
masses / year {\it independent of the magnitude of alpha} for systems with one
solar mass, three solar radius central objects. Infall accretion rates in the
range of (1-10)x10^{-6} solar masses per year produce observed FU~Orionis time
scales consistent with estimates of spherical molecular cloud core collapse
rates.

The recent {\sl ROSAT \/} X-ray detections of hot intergalactic gas in three
groups of galaxies are reviewed and the resulting baryonic fraction in these
groups is reevaluated. We show that the baryonic fraction obtained, assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium, should depend, perhaps sensitively, on the radius out
to which the X-rays are detected, and the temperature profile of the gas. We
find that the NGC 2300 group has a baryonic fraction out to $25'$ of at least
20\%, thus over five times higher than in the original analysis of Mulchaey
\etal\ (1993), and also much higher than one would obtain from big-bang
nucleosynthesis, but similar to the other two groups as well as rich clusters.
With this baryonic fraction, groups would be fair tracers of the distribution
of baryons in the Universe if $\Omega h_{50}^2 = 0.3$. A baryonic fraction that
increases with radius is consistent with the X-ray data from all three groups.
However, a detailed analysis of the NGC 2300 group shows that the dependence of
baryonic fraction on radius is not well constrained by the data, in part
because of uncertainties in the estimated background.

Gravothermal oscillations occur in several models for the post-collapse
evolution of rich star clusters. This paper reviews the main literature, and
presents some new N-body results which appear to exhibit this phenomenon.

OBSERVATIONS of galaxies to very faint magnitudes have revealed a population
of blue galaxies at intermediate redshift$^{1-5}$. These galaxies represent a
significant excess over the expectation of standard cosmological models for
reasonable amounts of evolution of the locally observed galaxy population.
However, the surveys which define the local galaxy population are strongly
biased against objects of low surface brightness$^{6-9}$. Low surface
brightness galaxies have properties very similar to those of the excess blue
population$^{10,11}$, and recent work suggests that they are comparable in
abundance to the more readily detected normal galaxies$^{9,12}$. I show that
the very deep surveys which reveal the excess population can easily detect low
surface brightness galaxies to large redshifts, but that local surveys will
miss them because they are not comparably sensitive. This suggests that the
excess faint galaxies {\it are\/} low surface brightness galaxies. No
alteration of standard cosmology is required, but it is necessary to reconsider
the way in which the galaxy distribution function is specified.

Relativistic electron-positron winds with strong magnetic fields are
considered as a source of radiation for cosmological $\gamma$-ray bursters.
Such a wind is generated by a millisecond pulsar with a very strong magnetic
field. An electron-positron plasma near the pulsar is optically thick and in
quasi-thermodynamic equilibrium. It is shown that the main part of radiation
from the pulsar wind is nonthermal and generates in the following way. Kinetic
energy which is released in the process of deceleration of the neutron star
rotation transforms mainly to the magnetic field energy. The magnetic field is
frozen in the outflowing plasma if the distance to the pulsar is smaller than
$\sim 10^{13}$ cm. This field transfers the energy from the pulsar environment
to the region outside the $\gamma$-ray photosphere of the electron-positron
wind. At a distance of more than $\sim 10^{13}$ cm the magnetohydrodynamic
approximation for the pulsar wind is broken, and intense electromagnetic waves
are generated. The frequency of these waves is equal to the frequency of the
pulsar rotation. Outflowing particles are accelerated in the field of intense
electromagnetic waves to Lorentz factors of the order of $10^6$ and generate
nonthermal synchro-Compton radiation. The typical energy of nonthermal photons
is $\sim 1$ MeV. A high-energy tail of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum may be up to
$\sim 10^4$ MeV. Baryonic matter is ejected occasionally from the pulsar
magnetosphere. The baryonic matter ejection and subsequent suppression of the
$\gamma$-ray emission may be responsible for the time structure of $\gamma$-ray
bursts.

We present VLA observations in the hydroxyl line OH(1720 MHz) towards the
supernova remnant W28. These high resolution images show a more extensive
distribution of 1720 MHz emission than had previously been suspected from
earlier single-dish observations. A total of 26 distinct maser spots were
detected which lie on the edge of the radio continuum emission from W28 and are
unresolved with our 12 arcsec resolution. Significant detection of linear and
circular polarization in the maser spots is also made. The location of the
maser spots, together with the physical conditions in the SNR and the adjacent
molecular cloud, argue for a shock excitation mechanism. The possibilities of
using the OH(1720 MHz) as a powerful diagnostic of the interaction of supernova
remnants with molecular clouds is discussed.

In this paper, I present the calculation of the third and fourth moments of
both the distribution function of the large--scale density and the large--scale
divergence of the velocity field, $\theta$. These calculations are made by the
mean of perturbative calculations assuming Gaussian initial conditions and are
expected to be valid in the linear or quasi linear regime. The moments are
derived for a top--hat window function and for any cosmological parameters
$\Omega$ and $\Lambda$. It turns out that the dependence with $\Lambda$ is
always very weak whereas the moments of the distribution function of the
divergence are strongly dependent on $\Omega$. A method to measure $\Omega$
using the skewness of this field has already been presented by Bernardeau et
al. (1993). I show here that the simultaneous measurement of the skewness and
the kurtosis allows to test the validity of the gravitational instability
scenario hypothesis. Indeed there is a combination of the first three moments
of $\theta$ that is almost independent of the cosmological parameters $\Omega$
and $\Lambda$, $${(<\theta^4>-3<\theta^2>^2) <\theta^2> \over
<\theta^3>^2}\approx 1.5,$$ (the value quoted is valid when the index of the
power spectrum at the filtering scale is close to -1) so that any cosmic
velocity field created by gravitational instabilities should verify such a
property.

I consider the effect of repeating gamma ray burst sources on the <V/Vmax>
statistic. I find that the treatment of repeating events, if applied
consistently, will not affect the effectiveness of <V/Vmax> as a test of burst
homogeneity. The calculation of <V/Vmax> for apparent repeating and
nonrepeating source populations will be biased by the incorrect classification
of faint bursts. The current practice of calculating <V/Vmax> using all bursts
is valid and consistent.

We propose a novel method for the description of spatial patterns formed by a
coverage of point sets representing galaxy samples. This method is based on a
complete family of morphological measures known as Minkowski functionals, which
includes the topological Euler characteristic and geometric descriptors to
specify the content, shape and connectivity of spatial sets. The method is
numerically robust even for small samples, independent of statistical
assumptions, and yields global as well as local morphological information. We
illustrate the method by applying it to a Poisson process, a `double-Poisson'
process, and to the Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters.

We present the first results of a galaxy redshift survey, ESO Slice Project
(ESP), we are accomplishing as an ESO Key--Project over about 40 square degrees
in a region near the South Galactic Pole. The limiting magnitude is $b_J =
19.4$. Up to now $\sim 85\%$ of the observations has been completed and $\sim
65\%$ of the data has been reduced providing $\sim 2000$ galaxy redshifts. We
present some preliminary results concerning the large scale galaxy
distribution, the luminosity function and the properties of galaxies with
spectra showing prominent emission lines.

The evolution of irregular galaxies is examined from two points of view: on
the one hand, models of galactic chemical evolution have been computed and
their predictions compared with the corresponding observational data on the
element abundances, and on the other hand, the results of a new method to
derive the star formation history in the last 1 Gyr in nearby irregulars are
presented.

We use statistical and topological quantities to test the COBE-DMR first year
sky maps against the hypothesis that the observed temperature fluctuations
reflect Gaussian initial density perturbations with random phases. Recent
papers discuss specific quantities as discriminators between Gaussian and
non-Gaussian behavior, but the treatment of instrumental noise on the data is
largely ignored. The presence of noise in the data biases many statistical
quantities in a manner dependent on both the noise properties and the unknown
CMB temperature field. Appropriate weighting schemes can minimize this effect,
but it cannot be completely eliminated. Analytic expressions are presented for
these biases, and Monte Carlo simulations used to assess the best strategy for
determining cosmologically interesting information from noisy data. The genus
is a robust discriminator that can be used to estimate the power law
quadrupole-normalized amplitude independently of the 2-point correlation
function. The genus of the DMR data are consistent with Gaussian initial
fluctuations with Q_rms = 15.7 +/- 2.2 - (6.6 +/- 0.3)(n - 1) uK where n is the
power law index. Fitting the rms temperature variations at various smoothing
angles gives Q_rms = 13.2 +/- 2.5 uK and n = 1.7 +0.3 -0.6. While consistent
with Gaussian fluctuations, the first year data are only sufficient to rule out
strongly non-Gaussian distributions of fluctuations.

We have conducted timing observations of the eclipsing millisecond binary
pulsar PSR~B1957+20, extending the span of data on this pulsar to more than
five years. During this time the orbital period of the system has varied by
roughly $\Delta P_b/P_b = 1.6 \times 10^{-7}$, changing quadratically with time
and displaying an orbital period second derivative $\ddot P_b = (1.43 \pm 0.08)
\times 10^{-18}\,$s$^{-1}$. The previous measurement of a large negative
orbital period derivative reflected only the short-term behavior of the system
during the early observations; the orbital period derivative is now positive
and increasing rapidly. If, as we suspect, the PSR~B1957+20 system is
undergoing quasi-cyclic orbital period variations similar to those found in
other close binaries such as Algol and RS CVn, then the $0.025\,M{_\odot}$
companion to PSR~B1957+20 is most likely non-degenerate, convective, and
magnetically active.

We analyze the temperature three--point correlation function and the skewness
of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), providing general relations in terms
of multipole coefficients. We then focus on applications to large angular scale
anisotropies, such as those measured by the {\em COBE} DMR, calculating the
contribution to these quantities from primordial, inflation generated, scalar
perturbations, via the Sachs--Wolfe effect. Using the techniques of stochastic
inflation we are able to provide a {\it universal} expression for the ensemble
averaged three--point function and for the corresponding skewness, which
accounts for all primordial second--order effects. These general expressions
would moreover apply to any situation where the bispectrum of the primordial
gravitational potential has a {\em hierarchical} form. Our results are then
specialized to a number of relevant models: power--law inflation driven by an
exponential potential, chaotic inflation with a quartic and quadratic potential
and a particular case of hybrid inflation. In all these cases non--Gaussian
effects are small: as an example, the {\em mean} skewness is much smaller than
the cosmic {\em rms} skewness implied by a Gaussian temperature fluctuation
field.

Particles with energies below the mean energy $E_0$ in relativistic shocked
plasmas should assume an equilibrium energy distribution. This leads to a
synchrotron spectrum $F_\nu \propto \nu^{1/3}$ up to approximately the critical
frequency $\nu_0$ of an electron with the energy $E_0$. Application to GRBs
implies that a burst with $10^{-5}$ erg/cm$^2$s of soft gamma-rays and $h \nu_0
= 300$ KeV should be about 18th magnitude in visible light and a few $\mu$Jy at
1 GHz (less if self-absorbed).

There exists a growing body of observational evidence supporting a
non-vanishing cosmological constant at the present epoch. We examine the
possibility that such a term may arise directly from the potential energy which
drove an inflationary expansion of the very early universe. To avoid arbitrary
alterations in the shape of this potential at various epochs it is necessary to
introduce a time-dependent viscosity into the system. The evolution of the
effective Planck mass in scalar-tensor theories is a natural candidate for such
an effect. In these models there are observational constraints arising from
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, large-scale galactic
structure, observations of the primordial Helium abundance and solar system
tests of general relativity. Decaying power law and exponential potentials are
considered, but for these models it is very difficult to simultaneously satisfy
all of the limits. This may have implications for the joint evolution of the
gravitational and cosmological constants.

Massive multicolor digital surveys in the near infrared provide new
opportunities for statistical analyses of the properties of groups and
clusters. These galaxy systems provide a natural laboratory for studying
dynamical processes and galaxy evolution, and serve as powerful cosmological
diagnostics. The immediate scientific returns to be expected from near-infrared
surveys such as DENIS and 2MASS are presented, and illustrated with simulated
images of a Coma-like rich cluster.

Within the context of the cold dark matter model, current observations
suggest that inflationary models which generate a tilted primordial power
spectrum with negligible gravitational waves provide the most promising
mechanism for explaining large scale clustering. The general form of the
inflationary potential which produces such a spectrum is a hyperbolic function
and is interpreted physically as a bulk viscous stress contribution to the
energy-momentum of a perfect baryotropic fluid. This is equivalent to expanding
the equation of state as a truncated Taylor series. Particle physics models
which lead to such a potential are discussed.

We calculate the theoretical expectation for the bulk motion of a large scale
survey of the type recently carried out by Lauer and Postman. Included are the
effects of survey geometry, errors in the distance measurements, clustering
properties of the sample, and different assumed power spectra. We consider the
power spectrum calculated from the IRAS--QDOT survey, as well as spectra from
hot $+$ cold and standard cold dark matter models. We find that sparse sampling
and clustering can lead to an unexpectedly large bulk flow, even in a very deep
survey. Our results suggest that the expected bulk motion is inconsistent with
that reported by Lauer and Postman at the $90-94\%$ confidence level.

We present the results of a $\lambda$20 cm VLA observation of the compact
Galactic center radio source Sgr A$^*$. The scatter-broadened image is
elongated in the East-West direction, with an axial ratio of 0.6$\pm$0.05 and a
position angle of 87$^0\pm$3$^0$. A similar shape and orientation has been
found previously at shorter wavelengths using VLBI and VLBA. Both the major and
minor axes follow the $\lambda^2$ law appropriate for scattering by turbulence
in the intervening medium. Assuming that the anisotropy is caused by a magnetic
field permeating the scattering medium, we argue that the scattering occurs
within extended HII regions lying in the central 100 pc of the Galaxy. The
magnetic field in this region must be poloidal, organized and is estimated to
have a strength of at least 30 to 100 $\mu$Gauss.

The edge-on Sc galaxy NGC 5907 has been observed in the 12CO(1-0)-line
emission using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The radial density distribution
between 2 and 13 kpc is well represented by a superposition of an
exponential-law disk of scale radius 3.5 kpc and a ring of 7 kpc radius.
However, no concentration of gas has been observed in the central 2 kpc. The
radial distribution and position-velocity diagram are compared in detail with
those obtained for HI. We found that the molecular gas dominates in the central
5 kpc region, while HI does in the outer region, clearly separated by a
``molecular front'' at 5 kpc radius. This molecular front will be the place
where the phase change from HI to molecular hydrogen, or vice versa, is taking
place in a galactic scale. The central deficiency of the molecular gas is
exceptional for a late type galaxy, which was found for the first time among Sc
galaxies, and the second case after the Sb galaxy M31. We argue for the
possibility of destruction of the nuclear gas disk by a merger of another
galaxy, and discuss its relation to the outer warping disk.

We present the results of spectroscopic observations of 10 nucleated dwarf
elliptical galaxies (dE's) in the Fornax cluster. The blue spectra of Fornax dE
galaxies indicate a wide range of metallicities at a given luminosity, similar
to those of intermediate to \it metal-rich globular clusters. Metal abundances
derived in this paper are well correlated with optical colors and agree with
previous spectroscopic results. A discrepancy with metallicities inferred from
infrared colors is evident; possible causes include an intermediate age
population and dilution of spectral features by a blue light excess. Dwarf
ellipticals exhibit a wide variation of hydrogen line strength which points to
a complex star formation history. Prominent Balmer absorption lines are the
signature of a young stellar population in the nuclei of some (but not all)
dE's, while moderately strong Balmer lines in relatively metal-rich dE's are
more consistent with an extended main sequence. The velocity distribution of
the Fornax dwarfs is flatter than that of brighter galaxies at the 75\%
confidence level, possibly indicating a difference in the kinematics of the two
samples.

We study the prospects for the current microlensing searches, which have
recently discovered several candidates, to yield useful information about the
flattening of the Galaxy dark matter halo. Models of HI warps and N-body
simulations of galaxy formation suggest that disks commonly form in oblate
halos with a tilt between the disk and halo symmetry axes. The microlensing
optical depth for the Large Magellanic Cloud depends sensitively on the
disk-halo tilt angle in the Milky Way. We conclude that a much larger spread in
values for $\tau(LMC)$ is consistent with rotation curve constraints than
previously thought, and that the ratio $\tau(SMC)/\tau(LMC)$ of the optical
depth to the Small and Large Magellanic clouds is not a clean test of halo
flattening.

We have recently learned that the Zeldovich approximation can be successfully
used for a far wider range of gravitational instability scenarios than formerly
proposed; we study here how to extend this range. In previous work we studied
the accuracy of several analytic approximations to gravitational clustering in
the mildly nonlinear regime. We found that the ``truncated Zel'dovich
approximation" (TZA) was better than any other (except in one case the ordinary
Zeldovich approximation) over a wide range from linear to mildly nonlinear
($\sigma \sim 3$) regimes. TZA sets Fourier amplitudes equal to zero for {\it
all} wavenumbers greater than $k_{n\ell}$, where $k_{n\ell}$ marks the
transition to the nonlinear regime. Here, we study crosscorrelation of
generalized TZA with a group of $n$--body simulations for three shapes of
window function: sharp $k$--truncation (as in CMS), tophat in coordinate space,
or a Gaussian. We also study the crosscorrelation as a function of initial
scale within each window type. We find $k$--truncation, which was so much
better than other things tried in CMS, is the {it worst} of these three window
shapes. We find that a Gaussian window $e^{-k^2/2k_G^2}$ applied to the intial
Fourier amplitudes is the best choice. It produces a greatly improved
crosscorrelation all cases we studied. The optimum choice of $k_G$ for the
Gaussian window is (spectrum-- dependent) 1--1.5 times $k_{n\ell}$, with
$k_{n\ell}$ defined by (3). Although all three windows produce similar power
spectra and density distribution functions after application of the Zeldovich
approximation, phase agreement with the $n$--body simulation is better for the
Gaussian window. We ascribe Gaussian window success to its superior treatment
of phase evolution.

Recent high energy gamma-ray observations (E>100 MeV) of blazar AGN show
emission spectra with no clear upper energy cutoff. AGN, considered to be
possible sources for the highest energy cosmic rays, may have emission
extending well into the VHE (very high energy, E>100 GeV) domain. Because VHE
gamma-rays are absorbed by pair production on the intergalactic background
radiation, much of this emission is not visible. Electromagnetic cascades
initiated by absorbed VHE gamma-rays, however, may be observable. Since the
velocities of e+e- pairs produced in a cascade are likely to be isotropized by
an ambient random magnetic field, extended ``halos'' (R>1 Mpc) of pairs will be
formed around AGN with VHE emission. Cascade radiation from these pair halos is
emitted isotropically and is observable below a few TeV. The halo radiation can
be distinguished by its characteristic variation in spectrum and intensity with
angular distance from the central source. This variation depends weakly on the
details of the central source model, e.g., the orientation and beaming/opening
angle of an emitting jet. Limiting or determining the intensity of the pair
halo can thus serve as a model-independent bound on or measure of the VHE power
of AGN. Next-generation Cherenkov telescopes may be able to image a pair halo.

A recent re-analysis of Einstein data, and new ROSAT observations, have
revealed the presence of at least two components in the X-ray spectra of X-ray
faint early-type galaxies: a relatively hard component (kT>1.5 keV), and a very
soft component (kT\sim 0.2-0.3 keV). We address the problem of the nature of
the very soft component, and whether it can be due to a hot interstellar medium
(ISM), or is most likely originated by the collective emission of very soft
stellar sources. To this purpose, hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences for the
secular behavior of gas flows in ellipticals have been performed, and the
results are compared with the observational X-ray data: the very soft component
could be entirely explained with a hot ISM only in galaxies where the depth of
the potential well is quite shallow, otherwise the softest contribution to the
X-ray emission comes certainly from stellar sources. As stellar soft X-ray
emitters, we consider late-type stellar corone, supersoft sources such as those
discovered by ROSAT in the Magellanic Clouds and M31, and RSCVn systems. We
finally present a model for the X-ray emission of NGC4365, to reproduce in
detail the results of the ROSAT pointed observation (PSPC spectrum and radial
surface brightness distribution).

Radiation of both the outer gaps and the neutron star surface is considered
for a Vela-like pulsar near the death line. It is shown that if such a pulsar
is close enough to the death line, its optical, UV and X-ray emission has to
increase. Using results of this consideration, it is argued that Geminga is not
a close relative of Vela-like pulsars. The outer gap model of Geminga in which
the main part of the outer gap volume operates as a Vela-like generator of
$\gamma$-rays is ruled out. A Vela-like mechanism of $\gamma$-ray generation
can operate only in a small region of the outer gap of Geminga. The length of
this region along the magnetic field is an order of magnitude smaller than the
outer gap dimensions. In the magnetosphere of Geminga the main mechanism of
$\gamma$-ray generation at $\sim 10 - 10^4$ MeV is curvature radiation and not
the synchrotron radiation as it was assumed for Vela-like pulsars.

If gamma-ray bursters are at cosmological distances - as suggested by their
isotropic distribution on the sky and by their number-intensity relation - then
the burst profiles will be stretched in time, by an amount proportional to the
redshift, 1 + $z$. We have tested data from the {\it Compton} Gamma Ray
Observatory's Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) for such time
dilation. Our measures of time scale are constructed to avoid selection effects
arising from intensity differences by rescale all bursts to fiducial levels of
peak intensity and noise bias. The three tests involved total count rate above
background, wavelet decomposition, and alignment of the highest peaks. In all
three tests, the dim bursts are stretched by a factor of about two relative to
the bright ones, over seven octaves of time scale. We calibrated the
measurements by dilating synthetic bursts that approximate the temporal
characteristics of bright BATSE bursts. Results are consistent with bursts of
BATSE's peak-flux completeness limit being at cosmological distances
corresponding to $z \sim 1$, and thus with independent cosmological
interpretations of the BATSE number-intensity relation.

Recently the French EROS collaboration and the American-Australian MACHO
collaboration have reported the observation of altogether three possible
microlensing events by monitoring over several years the brightness of millions
of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. For each of these events, assuming they
are due to microlensing, we compute the most likely mass for the dark compact
halo object, which acted as gravitational lens. The most likely masses are
0.12, 0.31 and 0.38 $M_{\odot}$. The average mass calculated using the method
of moments turns out to be 0.14 $M_{\odot}$.

There are strong indications from recent papers (e.g. Worthey et al. 1992)
that the abundance ratio of Mg/Fe, and consequently also O/Fe in giant
elliptical galaxies is not solar. The line strengths of two Fe lines at 5270
and 5335 A are weaker than one expects from the strength of the Mg b line if
[Mg/Fe] = 0. We have synthesized absorption line indices to derive the Mg and
Fe abundances of these galaxies. For these models we have calculated new
evolutionary tracks of high metallicity stars with a range of Mg/Fe abundances.
This is the first time that such tracks have been generated. Integrating along
isochrones to synthesize metal line strengths we find that for a typical bright
giant elliptical [Mg/Fe] has to be between +0.3 and +0.7. We show that this
result is independent of other parameters such as age, total metal content and
mixing length parameter. The total metal content is super-solar, but the iron
metallicity of elliptical galaxies not necessarily has to be larger than solar.
For the formation of elliptical galaxies our result on the Mg and Fe abundances
has the implication that most of the enrichment of the gas has to come from SNe
II, which have more massive progenitors and as such produce relatively more O
and Mg than Fe. It means that most of the stars have to be formed within a
period of $3 \times 10^8$ years, so that there can only be one major collapse
phase of the galaxy.

Compton scattering of external radiation by nonthermal particles in
outflowing blazar jets is dominated by accretion-disk photons rather than
scattered radiation to distances $\sim 0.01-0.1$ pc from the central engine for
standard parameters, thus clarifying the limits of validity of the model by the
present authors and the model of Sikora, Begelman, \& Rees. On the basis of
contemporaneous Ginga X-ray and EGRET gamma-ray observations, we estimate the
radius of 3C 279's gamma-ray photosphere to be smaller than estimated by
Blandford. There is thus no need to require that the acceleration and emission
sites of gamma-ray blazars to be located farther than $\sim 10^{2-3}$
gravitational radii from the central engine. We argue that lineless BL Lac
objects, rather than quasars, are more likely to be detected in the TeV energy
range.

A self-consistent model for binary evolution devised by Gingold \& Monaghan
(1980) is used to show that two distinctly different types of behaviour are
possible for close eccentric binaries. The model is based on a linear adiabatic
normal mode analysis of the problem, which allows detailed examination of the
transfer of energy from the orbit to the tides. We show that for most binaries,
energy is exchanged quasi-periodically, with the system regulating itself so
that the maximum tidal energy always remains small, and no circularization
takes place. In contrast, for a range of eccentricities and periastron
separations, {\it chaotic} behaviour prevails, with the eccentricity following
a random walk and with the energy transferred to the tides during a single
periastron passage being up to an order of magnitude larger than that
transferred during the initial periastron passage.
  These results have important consequences for the study of tidal capture
binaries. The standard model (see, for example, McMillan, McDermott \& Taam
1987) assumes that the energy transferred to the tides during a periastron
encounter is independent of the oscillatory state of the stars, and that the
amount of tidal energy present at any time can be calculated using a formula
which (accurately) gives the amount deposited after the first encounter (Press
\& Teukolsky 1977). The calculations presented here show that a self-consistent
treatment is necessary in order to study the dynamical evolution of tidal
capture binaries. We conclude that the tidal capture process would not be
possible were it not for the existence of chaotic behaviour.

A self-consistent, adiabatic model for the {\it long-time} behaviour of tidal
capture binaries is presented. It is shown that most capture orbits behave
chaotically, with the eccentricity following a quasi-random walk between the
values of $\appless 1$ and some lower limit associated with the periastron
separation at capture.
  If dissipation is taken into account, the binary goes through a short and
violent chaotic phase, followed by a long quiescent phase in which it slowly
circularizes from a high eccentricity on a much longer timescale than
previously thought. A consequence is that merger is less likely than previously
thought, and hence such binaries will be available as a heat source to the
cores of globular clusters, particularly while they are in the less tightly
bound, highly eccentric phase.
  If the model is correct, any highly eccentric binaries observed in globular
clusters which contain a main-sequence star will most likely be found to have a
period derivative much smaller than that predicted by the standard model.
  We also predict that the companion of PSR B1718-19 in NGC 6342 which is a
globular cluster binary likely to have been formed by tidal capture (Wijers \&
Paczy\'{n}ski 1993) will be found to have a mass of around $0.2M_\odot$.
  The model may be used to describe the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries,
pulsar binaries, and cataclysmic binaries which abound in globular clusters.

{}From three quasar samples with a total of 1038 objects in the redshift
range $1.0 \div 2.2$ we measure the variance $\sigma^2$ of counts in cells of
volume $V_u$. By a maximum likelihood analysis applied separately on these
samples we obtain estimates of $\sigma^2(\ell)$, with $\ell \equiv V_u^{1/3}$.
The analysis from a single catalog for $\ell = ~40~h^{-1}$ Mpc and from a
suitable average over the three catalogs for $\ell = ~60,~80$ and $100~h^{-1}$
Mpc, gives $\sigma^2(\ell) = 0.46^{+0.27}_{-0.27}$, $0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$,
$0.05^{+0.14}_{-0.05}$ and $0.12^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$, respectively, where the
$70\%$ confidence ranges account for both sampling errors and statistical
fluctuations in the counts. This allows a comparison of QSO clustering on large
scales with analogous data recently obtained both for optical and IRAS
galaxies: QSOs seem to be more clustered than these galaxies by a biasing
factor $b_{QSO}/b_{gal} \sim 1.4 - 2.3$.

We present a determination of the cosmic microwave background dipole
amplitude and direction from the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR)
first year of data. Data from the six DMR channels are consistent with a
Doppler-shifted Planck function of dipole amplitude Delta T = 3.365 +/-0.027 mK
toward direction (l,b) = (264.4 +/- 0.3 deg, 48.4 +/- 0.5 deg). The implied
velocity of the Local Group with respect to the CMB rest frame is 627 +/- 22
km/s toward (l,b) = (276 +/- 3 deg, 30 +/- 3 deg). DMR has also mapped the
dipole anisotropy resulting from the Earth's orbital motion about the Solar
system barycenter, yielding a measurement of the monopole CMB temperature at
31.5, 53, and 90 GHz, to be 2.75 +/- 0.05 K.

We present an exact solution of the anisotropies of cosmic background
radiation (CBR) from a local collapse described by a spherical over-dense
region embedded in a flat universe, with the emphasis on the relationship
between the dipole $(\Delta {\sf T}/{\sf T})_d$ and the quadrupole $(\Delta
{\sf T}/{\sf T})_q$ anisotropy. This result has been used to examine the
kinematic quadrupole correction $(\Delta {\sf T}/{\sf T})_q=(\Delta {\sf
T}/{\sf T})_d^2/2$, which is usually applied to remove the contamination of the
quadrupole produced by local density inhomogeneities when finding the cosmic
amplitude of the quadrupole at the surface of last scattering. We have found
that the quadrupole of local collapse origin cannot always be approximately
described by the kinematic quadrupole. Our numerical result shows that the
difference between the kinematic and local quadrupoles depends on the size and
matter density in the peculiar field, and the position of the observer. For a
given dipole, the local quadrupole can be different from the kinematic
quadrupole by a factor as large as 3. Therefore, the kinematic quadrupole
correction remains an uncertain factor in the determination of the amplitude of
a cosmic quadrupole. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis shows that this
uncertainty might not dramatically change the cosmological origin of the
COBE-DMR's quadrupole, unless a huge peculiar gravitational field is assumed.

Quasar-galaxy associations, if they result from the effect of gravitational
lensing by foreground galaxies, depend sensitively on the shape of the quasar
number counts. Two kinds of quasar number-magnitude relations are predicted to
produce quite different properties in quasar-galaxy associations: the counts of
Boyle, Shanks and Peterson (1988; BSP) provide both positive and ``negative"
associations between distant quasars and foreground galaxies, relating closely
with the knee ($B\approx19.15$) in these counts. However, Hawkins and V\'eron
(1993; HV) quasar data lead to only a positive magnitude-independent
quasar-galaxy association. The current observational evidence on quasar-galaxy
associations, either positive or null, is shown to be the natural result of
gravitational lensing if quasars follow the BSP number-magnitude relation. On
the other hand, the HV counts are unable to produce the reported associations
by the mechanism of gravitational lensing. It is emphasized that special
attention should be paid to the limiting magnitudes in the selected quasar
samples when one works on quasar-galaxy associations.

The expected microlensing events of the LMC by the MACHOs of the LMC itself
are calculated and compared with analogue events by objects in the Galactic
halo. The LMC matter distribution is modelled by a spherical halo and an
exponential disk while a face-on exponential disk is used for the stellar
distribution of the LMC. Among the microlensing events discovered by the MACHOs
and EROS projects, a fraction of $22\%$ could be caused by the lenses near the
center of the LMC or $13\%$ from lenses at $5^o$ from the LMC center.
Therefore, any statistical study of these microlensing events must take the LMC
lenses into account.

We investigate the associations between background galaxies and foreground
clusters of galaxies due to the effect of gravitational lensing by clusters of
galaxies. Similar to the well-known quasar-galaxy ones, these associations
depend sensitively on the shape of galaxy number-magnitude or number-flux
relation, and both positive and ``negative" associations are found to be
possible, depending on the limiting magnitude and/or the flux threshold in the
surveys. We calculate the enhancement factors assuming a singular isothermal
sphere model for clusters of galaxies and a pointlike model for background
sources selected in three different wavelengths, $B$, $K$ and radio. Our
results show that $K-$ selected galaxies might constitute the best sample to
test the ``negative" associations while it is unlikely that one can actually
observe any association for blue galaxies. We also point out that bright radio
sources ($S>1$ Jy) can provide strong positive associations, which may have
been already detected in 3CR sample.

Starquakes are considered for fast-rotating magnetic white dwarfs. The X-ray
pulsar 1E 2259 + 586 may be such a white dwarf. It is shown that in this case
starquakes may be responsible for the decrease of the mean spin-down rate which
was observed for 1E 2259 + 586 between 1987 and 1990. The required mass of the
white dwarf which is identified with 1E 2259 + 586 is $\sim 1.4 - 1.5 M_\odot$,
making this X-ray pulsar the most massive white dwarf known.

We examine the damping of non-linear sub-horizon scale entropy fluctuations
in early epochs of the universe ($T\approx 100$ GeV to $T\approx 1$keV) by
neutrino, baryon, and photon induced dissipative processes. Results of
numerical evolution calculations are presented for broad ranges of initial
fluctuation amplitudes and length scales. These calculations include a detailed
treatment of neutrino inflation, neutron and proton diffusion, photon diffusive
heat transport, and hydrodynamic expansion with photon-electron Thomson drag.
Neutrino inflation is treated both in the diffusive heat transport regime where
neutrinos are optically thick on the length scales of the fluctuations, and in
the homogeneous heating regime where neutrinos are optically thin on these
scales. We find considerable convergence in amplitude evolution for appreciable
ranges in initial fluctuation length scales and amplitudes. Fluctuations
produced with the right characteristics at very early times ($T$ $^>_{\sim}$
100 GeV) are found to survive through the nucleosynthesis epoch.

We present exact analytical solutions to the Conformal Weyl Gravity
cosmological equations that are valid for both the matter and radiation
dominated eras. The Primordial Nucleosynthesis process is also exhaustively
studied. The main conclusion of our work is that cosmological models derived
from this theory are not likely to reproduce the observational properties of
our Universe. They fail to fulfill simultaneously the observational constraints
on present cosmological parameters and on primordial light element abundances.

We present a detailed study of inhomogeneous Big Bang nucleosynthesis where,
for the first time, nuclear reactions are coupled to all significant
fluctuation dissipation processes. Theses processes include neutrino heat
transport, baryon diffusion, photon diffusive heat transport, and hydrodynamic
expansion with photon-electron Thomson drag. Light element abundance yields are
presented for broad ranges of initial amplitudes and length scales for
spherically condensed fluctuations. The $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, and $^7$Li
nucleosynthesis yields are found to be inconsistent with observationally
inferred primordial abundances for all but very narrow ranges of fluctuation
characteristics. Rapid hydrodynamic expansion of fluctuations late in the
nucleosynthesis epoch results in significant destruction of $^7$Li ($^7$Be)
only if the baryonic conytribution to the closure density ($\Omega_b$) is less
than or comparable to the upper limit on this quantity from homogeneous Big
Bang nucleosynthesis. This implies that $^7$Li overproduction will peclude an
increase on the upper limit for $\Omega_b$ for any inhomogeneous
nucleosynthesis scenarios employing spherically condensed fluctuations.

We show that primordial nucleosynthesis in baryon inhomogeneous big-bang
models can lead to significant heavy-element production while still satisfying
all the light-element abundance constraints including the low lithium abundance
observed in population II stars. The parameters which admit this solution arise
naturally from the process of neutrino induced inflation of baryon
inhomogeneities prior to the epoch of nucleosynthesis. These solutions entail a
small fraction of baryons (\le 2\%) in very high density regions with local
baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta^h\approx 10^{-4}$, while most baryons are at a
baryon-to-photon ratio which optimizes the agreement with light-element
abundances. The model would imply a unique signature of baryon inhomogeneities
in the early universe, evidenced by the existence of primordial material
containing heavy-element products of proton and alpha- burning reactions with
an abundance of $[Z]\sim -6 to -4$.

We map the smoothed mass-density distribution in the Galactic zone of
avoidance (zoa), within $6000\kms$ of the Local Group, using potent
reconstruction from peculiar velocities of galaxies. The interpolation into the
zoa is based on the assumed gravitational nature of the velocity field implying
a potential flow. The main dynamical features at a distance r=4000 km/s are (a)
the peak of the Great Attractor connecting Centaurus and Pavo at l=330, (b) a
moderate bridge connecting Perseus-Pisces and Cepheus at l= 140, and (c) an
extension of a large void from the southern Galactic hemisphere into the zoa
near the direction of Puppis, l=220-270. We find a strong correlation between
the mass density and the IRAS and optical galaxy density at $b=+-20, which
indicates that the main dynamical features in the zoa should also be seen in
galaxy surveys through the Galactic plane. The gravitational acceleration at
the Local Group, based on the mass distribution out to 6000 km/s, is strongly
affected by the mass distribution in the zoa: its direction changes by 31 when
the |b| < 20 zoa is included, bringing it to within 4 +- 19 of the CMB dipole.

It is well known that the standard transport equations violate causality when
gradients are large or when temporal variations are rapid. We derive a modified
set of transport equations that satisfy causality. These equations are obtained
from the underlying Boltzmann equation. We use a simple model for particle
collisions which enables us to derive moment equations non-perturbatively, i.e.
without making the usual assumption that the distribution function deviates
only slightly from its equilibrium value. We apply the model to two problems:
particle diffusion and viscous transport. In both cases we show that signals
propagate at a finite speed and therefore that the formalism obeys causality.
When the velocity gradient is large on the scale of a mean free path, the
viscous shear stress is suppressed relative to the prediction of the standard
diffusion approximation. The shear stress reaches a maximum at a finite value
of the shear amplitude and then decreases as the velocity gradient increases.
In the case of a steady Keplerian accretion disk with hydrodynamic turbulent
viscosity, the stress-limit translates to an upper bound on the Shakura-Sunyaev
$\alpha$-parameter, namely $\alpha<0.07$. The limit on $\alpha$ is much
stronger in narrow boundary layers where the velocity shear is larger than
Keplerian.

If the dark halo matter is primarily composed of MACHOs toward the lower end
of the possible detection range ($ < 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$) a fraction of the
lens detection events should involve the lens crossing directly in front of the
disk of the background star. Previously, Nemiroff (1987) has shown that each
crossing would create an inflection point in the light curve of the MACHO
event. Such inflection points would allow a measure of the time it took for the
gravitational lens to cross the stellar disk. Given an independent estimate of
the stellar radius by other methods, one could then obtain a more accurate
estimate of the velocity of the lens. This velocity could then, in turn, be
used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the mass range for the MACHO or disk
star doing the lensing.

In this paper, we present quantitative constraints on the scalar field
potential for a general class of inflationary models. (1) We first consider the
reconstruction of the inflationary potential for given primordial density
fluctuation spectra. Our work differs from previous work on reconstruction in
that we find a semi-analytic solution for the potential for the case of density
fluctuations with power-law spectra. In addition, for the case of more general
spectra, we show how constraints on the density fluctuation spectra imply
corresponding constraints on the potential. We present a series of figures
which show how the shape of the potential depends on the shape of the
perturbation spectrum and on the relative contribution of tensor modes. (2) We
show that the average ratio $\rave$ of the amplitude of tensor perturbations
(gravity wave perturbations) to scalar density perturbations is bounded from
above: $\rave \le$ 1.6. We also show that the ratio $\rave$ is proportional to
the change $\Delta \phi$ in the field: $\rave \approx 0.42 \Delta \phi/\mp$.
Thus, if tensor perturbations are important for the formation of structure,
then the width $\Delta \phi$ must be comparable to the Planck mass. (3) We
constrain the change $\Delta V$ of the potential and the change $\Delta \phi$
of the inflation field during the portion of inflation when cosmological
structure is produced. We find both upper and lower bounds for $\Delta \phi$
and for $\Delta V$. In addition, these constraints are then used to derive a
bound on the scale $\Lambda$, which is the scale of the height of the potential

SHORTENED ABSTRACT: We present numerical investigations designed to
critically test models of the origin of the Magellanic Stream. The most
developed model is the tidal model which fails to reproduce several of its
characteristic properties. We suggest an alternative model for the origin of
the Stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as well
as provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo of
the Milky Way. We propose that the Stream consists of material which was
ram-pressure stripped from the Magellanic System during its last passage
through an extended ionized disk of the Galaxy. This collision took place some
500 million years ago at a galacto-centric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept
$\sim 20$\% of the least bound HI into the Stream. The gas with the lowest
column density lost the most orbital angular momentum, and is presently at the
tip of the Stream, having fallen to a distance of $\sim 20$ kpc from the Milky
Way attaining a negative velocity of 200 \kms. To prevent the stripped material
from leading the Magellanic Clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity,
we postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gas
surrounding the Milky Way. If the halo gas is at the virial temperature of the
potential well of the Milky Way, its thermal emission would contribute $\sim$
40\% of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 keV (M) band,
consistent with recent ROSAT measurements as well as pulsar dispersion
measures. Ram pressure stripping

We present a study of the radio emission from rotating, charged dust grains
immersed in the ionized gas constituting the thick, H$\alpha$-emitting disk of
many spiral galaxies. Using up-to-date optical constants, the charge on the
grains exposed to the diffuse galactic UV flux has been calculated. An
analytical approximation for the grain charge has been derived, which is then
used to obtain the grain rotation frequency. Grains are found to have
substantial radio emission peaked at a cutoff frequency in the range
10-100~GHz, depending on the grain size distribution and on the efficiency of
the radiative damping of the grain rotation. The dust radio emission is
compared to the free-free emission from the ionized gas component; some
constraints on the magnetic field strength in the observed dusty filaments are
also discussed. The model can be used to test the disk-halo interface
environment in spiral galaxies, to determine the amount and size distribution
of dust in their ionized component, and to investigate the rotation mechanisms
for the dust. Numerical estimates are given for experimental purposes.

The first two years of COBE DMR observations of the CMB anisotropy are
analyzed and compared with our previously published first year results. The
results are consistent, but the addition of the second year of data increases
the precision and accuracy of the detected CMB temperature fluctuations. The
two-year 53 GHz data are characterized by RMS temperature fluctuations of
DT=44+/-7 uK at 7 degrees and DT=30.5+/-2.7 uK at 10 degrees angular
resolution. The 53X90 GHz cross-correlation amplitude at zero lag is
C(0)^{1/2}=36+/-5 uK (68%CL) for the unsmoothed 7 degree DMR data. A likelihood
analysis of the cross correlation function, including the quadrupole
anisotropy, gives a most likely quadrupole-normalized amplitude
Q_{rms-PS}=12.4^{+5.2}_{-3.3} uK (68% CL) and a spectral index
n=1.59^{+0.49}_{-0.55} for a power law model of initial density fluctuations,
P(k)~k^n. With n fixed to 1.0 the most likely amplitude is 17.4 +/-1.5 uK (68%
CL). Excluding the quadrupole anisotropy we find Q_{rms-PS}= 16.0^{+7.5}_{-5.2}
uK (68% CL), n=1.21^{+0.60}_{-0.55}, and, with n fixed to 1.0 the most likely
amplitude is 18.2+/-1.6 uK (68% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that
these derived estimates of n may be biased by ~+0.3 (with the observed low
value of the quadrupole included in the analysis) and {}~+0.1 (with the
quadrupole excluded). Thus the most likely bias-corrected estimate of n is
between 1.1 and 1.3. Our best estimate of the dipole from the two-year DMR data
is 3.363+/-0.024 mK towards Galactic coordinates (l,b)= (264.4+/-0.2 degrees,
+48.1+/-0.4 degrees), and our best estimate of the RMS quadrupole amplitude in
our sky is 6+/-3 uK.

We present a new analysis of previously published optical and radio data sets
of the gravitationally lensed quasar 0957+561 A,B with the aim of determining
the time delay between its two images. We use a non-parametric estimate of the
dispersion of the combined data set where, however, we only make use of
alternating neighbours in order to avoid windowing effects.
  From the optical data a time delay of (415 $\pm$ 32) days and from the radio
data a delay of (409 $\pm$ 23) days is suggested. We demonstrate a considerable
sensitivity of different delay estimation procedures against the removal of
only a few observational data points or against smoothing or detrending of the
original data sets. The radio data give us formally a slightly more precise
value for the time delay than the optical data. Also, due to the lack of
windowing effects, the result obtained for the radio data can be considered as
somewhat more reliable than the delay determined from the optical data.

The angular power spectrum estimator developed by Peebles (1973) and Hauser &
Peebles (1973) has been modified and applied to the 2 year maps produced by the
COBE DMR. The power spectrum of the real sky has been compared to the power
spectra of a large number of simulated random skies produced with noise equal
to the observed noise and primordial density fluctuation power spectra of power
law form, with $P(k) \propto k^n$. Within the limited range of spatial scales
covered by the COBE DMR, corresponding to spherical harmonic indices $3 \leq
\ell \lsim 30$, the best fitting value of the spectral index is $n =
1.25^{+0.4}_{-0.45}$ with the Harrison-Zeldovich value $n = 1$ approximately
0.5$\sigma$ below the best fit. For $3 \leq \ell \lsim 19$, the best fit is $n
= 1.46^{+0.39}_{-0.44}$. Comparing the COBE DMR $\Delta T/T$ at small $\ell$ to
the $\Delta T/T$ at $\ell \approx 50$ from degree scale anisotropy experiments
gives a smaller range of acceptable spectral indices which includes $n = 1$.

We show that seeds for quasar black holes could have originated from the
initial cosmological collapse of overdense regions with unusually small
rotation. The gas in these rare regions collapses into a compact disk that
shrinks on a short viscous time scale. Using an analytical model, we calculate
the low-spin tail of the probability distribution of angular momenta for
objects that collapse out of a Gaussian random field of initial density
perturbations. The population of low-spin systems is significant for any viable
power spectrum of primordial density perturbations. Most objects form just
above the cosmological Jeans mass (\sim 10^5 M_sun) at high redshifts z>10. In
the standard cold dark matter cosmology, the comoving density of 10^{6-7} M_sun
objects with viscous evolution times shorter than 10^{6-7} years is about
10^{-3} (h/0.5)^3 Mpc^{-3}, comparable to the local density of bright galaxies.
The seed black holes tend to reside within larger mass systems that collapse
later and supply the gas needed for the bright quasar activity.

We show how, based on considerations on the observed form of the galaxy
2-point spatial correlation function xi(r), a very simplified -- yet
surprisingly effective -- model for the linear density fluctuations power
spectrum can be constructed. We first relate the observed large-scale shape of
xi(r) to a power-law form for the power spectrum, P(k)\propto k^{-2.2}. For a
plausible value of the bias parameter b = 1/sigma_8 ~ 1.8, one has (delta_rho /
rho)_{rms} ~ 1 r ~ 3.5/h Mpc, suggesting that the change of slope observed in
xi(r) around this scale marks the transition between the linear and nonlinear
gravitational regimes. Under this working hypothesis, we use a simple
analytical form to fit the large-scale correlations constraints together with
the COBE CMB anisotropy measurement, thus constructing a simple
phenomenological model for the linear power spectrum. Despite its simplicity,
the model fits remarkably well directly estimated power spectra from different
optical galaxy samples, and when evolved through an N-body simulation it
provides a good match to the observed galaxy correlations. One of the most
interesting features of the model is the small-scale one-dimensional velocity
dispersion produced: sigma_{1d} = 450 Km s^{-1} at 0.5/h Mpc and sigma_{1d} =
350 Km s^{-1} for separations larger than ~ 2/h Mpc.

The formation of the resonance lines of neutral boron in solar-type stellar
atmospheres is investigated taking into account effects of departures from
local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE effects). The latter are due to a
combination of overionisation and optical pumping in resonance lines, both
caused by the hot, non-local, ultraviolet radiation fields in the line-forming
regions. They lead to an underestimation of the boron abundance when analysis
methods assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are used. The abundance
correction, for the 249.7~nm resonance line, amounts to $+$0.6 dex for the
metal-poor star HD140283 and $+$0.4 dex for Procyon. No significant NLTE
effects are predicted for the Sun. Applying the abundance correction on the
results for HD140283 of Duncan et al. (1992) leads to a B/Be ratio well above
the minimum value required by spallation production of beryllium. The
reliability of the results in view of atomic and atmospheric uncertainties is
discussed. With the possible exception of photospheric inhomogeneity, it seems
unlikely that these could remove the effect for HD140283.

We place empirical constraints on the physical properties of $\gamma-$ray
burst events at cosmological distances. In particular we derive probability
distributions for the radiation energy $E_\gamma$, the minimum Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{\rm min}$, the maximum baryonic mass $M_{\rm max}$ and the upper bound
on the surrounding gas density $n_{\rm max}$ in the events, based on 169 bursts
from the first BATSE catalog. Using peak flux as a distance indicator we probe
bursts where the constraints are stronger than average. The resulting variance
and skewness of the cosmological probability distributions are calculated in
addition to their mean values: $\langle E_\gamma\rangle=4\times 10^{51} h^{-2}
{\rm erg}$, $\langle \gamma_{\rm min}\rangle= 5\times 10^2$, $\langle M_{\rm
max}\rangle=10^{-5}\xi^{-1} M_\odot$, and $\langle (\gamma/\gamma_{\rm
min})^{-5} n_{\rm max}\rangle\lsim 10^{2} \xi^{-1}{\rm cm^{-3}}$, where $\xi$
is the fraction of the total energy which is converted to $\gamma-$rays. The
distribution of burst energies ends at about $10^{53} {\rm erg}$, close to the
binding energy of a neutron star.

A Massive Compact Halo Object (Macho) that lenses a background star will
magnify different parts of the rotating stellar disk by varying amounts. The
differential magnification will cause a shift in the centroid of the star's
spectral lines during the lensing event. The shift is proportional to the ratio
of the stellar radius to the projected separation of the Macho from the star.
It therefore provides a direct measure of the Einstein ring radius, and so also
a measure of the Macho's proper motion (angular speed). This measurement can
remove some of the degeneracy between mass, distance to the lens, and
transverse velocity that exists in the interpretation of results from ongoing
microlensing experiments, and is an independent test of the lensing nature of
the event. We show that using the high precision attainable by stellar radial
velocity measurements, it is possible to measure proper motions for $\sim 10\%$
of Machos that lens A-stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), i.e.\ $\sim
7\%$ of the type of relatively high-magnification events that have been
reported to date. If this proper-motion measurement were combined with a
parallax measurement of the ``reduced velocity'', then the Macho mass,
distance, speed, and direction could each be separately determined. The shift
can be measured for $\sim 20\%$ of the A-star events generated by Machos in the
dark halo of the LMC. This in turn would provide a measurement of the fraction
of LMC vs. Galactic Macho events.

We present the results of an exhaustive analysis of the morphological
segregation of galaxies in the CfA and SSRS catalogs through the scaling
formalism. Morphological segregation between ellipticals and spirals has been
detected at scales up to 15-20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc in the CfA catalog, and up to 20-30
h$^{-1}$ Mpc in the SSRS catalog. Moreover, it is present not only in the
densest areas of the galaxy distribution, but also in zones of moderate
density.

It is shown that the evolution of the density perturbations during certain
eras of substantial entropy generation in the universe can be described in the
scheme of the KPZ equation. Therefore, the influence on cosmological structure
formation by stochastic forces arising from various dissipations can be studied
through the universal characteristics of surface growth in $d=3+1$ dimensions.
We identify eras of strong stochastic fluctuations and describe dynamically how
these other dissipative sources of noise, besides initial (inflationary)
quantum fluctuations, generate seeds of density perturbation with power law
spectrum, including the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum.

A precise test of the theory of stellar evolution can be performed by
measuring the average difference in energy between the neutrino line produced
by ${\rm ^7Be}$ electron capture in the solar interior and the corresponding
neutrino line produced in a terrestrial laboratory. This energy shift is
calculated to be 1.29~keV (to an accuracy of a few percent) for the dominant
ground-state to ground-state transition. The energy shift is approximately
equal to the average temperature of the solar core, computed by integrating the
temperature over the solar interior with a weighting factor equal to the
locally-produced $^7$Be neutrino emission. The characteristic modulation of the
${\rm ^7Be}$ line shape that would be caused by either vacuum neutrino
oscillations or by matter-enhanced (MSW) neutrino oscillations is shown to be
small. Other frequently-discussed weak interaction solutions to the solar
neutrino problem are also not expected to change significantly the line
profile. Therefore, a measurement of the energy shift is a measurement of the
central temperature distribution of the sun.

We construct models of the inner part of a transonic adiabatic accretion disc
assuming constant specific angular momentum taking the vertical structure fully
into account.\\ For comparison purposes, we construct the corresponding one
dimensional viscous disc models derived under vertical averaging assumptions.
The conditions under which a unique location for the critical/sonic point is
obtained, given an appropriate set of exterior boundary conditions for these
models, is also discussed. This is not unique if the standard '$\alpha $'
prescription with viscous stress proportional to the angular velocity gradient
is used.\\ We use a simple model to discuss the possible limitations on the
form of the viscous stress arising from the requirement that viscous
information must travel at a finite speed. Contrary to results in the existing
literature, the viscous stress tends to be {\it increased} rather than reduced
for the type of flows we consider in which the angular momentum and angular
velocity gradients have opposite signs. However, finite propagation effects may
result in a unique location for the sonic point.\\ We found good agreement
between the radial flow and specific angular momentum profiles in the inner
regions of the one dimensional models and those in the equatorial plane for
corresponding two dimensional models which may be matched for a range of
$\alpha $ between 0.1 and 10$^{-4}$.

The formation of quasar black holes during the hydrodynamic collapse of
protogalactic gas clouds is discussed. The dissipational collapse and long-
term dynamical evolution of these systems is analysed using three-dimensional
numerical simulations. The calculations focus on the final collapse stages of
the inner baryonic component and therefore ignore the presence of dark matter.
Two types of initial conditions are considered: uniformly rotating spherical
clouds, and irrotational ellipsoidal clouds. In both cases the clouds are
initially cold, homogeneous, and not far from rotational support ($T/|W|
\approx 0.1$). Although the details of the dynamical evolution depend
sensitively on the initial conditions, the qualitative features of the final
configurations do not. Most of the gas is found to fragment into small dense
clumps, that eventually make up a spheroidal component resembling a galactic
bulge. About 5\% of the initial mass remains in the form of a smooth disk of
gas supported by rotation in the gravitational potential well of the outer
spheroid. If a central seed black hole of mass $\gsim10^6M_\odot$ forms, it can
grow by steady accretion from the disk and reach a typical quasar black hole
mass $\sim10^8M_\odot$ in less than $5\times 10^8\,$yr. In the absence of a
sufficiently massive seed, dynamical instabilities in a strongly self-
gravitating inner region of the disk will inhibit steady accretion of gas and
may prevent the immediate formation of a quasar.

We have performed a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of
binary coalescence using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The
initial conditions are exact polytropic equilibrium configurations with $\gam >
5/3$, on the verge of dynamical instability. We calculate the emission of
gravitational radiation in the quadrupole approximation. The fully nonlinear
development of the instability is followed until a new equilibrium
configuration is reached. We find that the properties of this final
configuration depend sensitively on both the compressibility and mass ratio. An
{\em axisymmetric} merged configuration is always produced when $\gam\lo2.3$.
As a consequence, the emission of gravitational radiation shuts off abruptly
right after the onset of dynamical instability. In contrast, {\em triaxial\/}
merged configurations are obtained when $\gam\go2.3$, and the system continues
to emit gravitational waves after the final coalescence. Systems with mass
ratios $q\ne1$ typically become dynamically unstable before the onset of mass
transfer. Stable mass transfer from one neutron star to another in a close
binary is therefore probably ruled out. The maximum amplitude $h_{max}$ and
peak luminosity $L_{max}$ of the gravitational waves emitted during the final
coalescence are nearly independent of $\gam$, but depend very sensitively on
the mass ratio $q$.

We have used HRCam on the CFHT to obtain subarcsecond images of 26 galaxies
with z=0.1--0.7. The primary sample of 17 galaxies have enhanced star formation
indicated by [OII] equivalent widths greater than 20\AA, while the comparison
sample of 9 galaxies have equivalent widths less than 10\AA. By fitting disks
or bulges to BVI images we derive scalelengths for the blue and red stellar
populations and locate the star-formation in each galaxy. These
moderate-redshift galaxies generally have straightforward low-redshift
analogues, in that their colours, sizes and luminosities are consistent with
those of various types of z$\approx$0 galaxies. The star-forming objects have
structures consistent with the full range of present-day disk galaxies, and
absolute magnitudes M$^\ast$$-$1 to M$^\ast$+5. Some have star-formation
concentrated in their nuclei but in most it occurs across the entire disk. We
find companions at projected distances closer than 10 kpc for 30% of the
star-forming galaxies, whereas none of the comparison sample have such close
companions. This provides the first direct evidence linking interactions or
mergers to the increased fraction of star-forming field galaxies at moderate
redshifts.

If indeed early type galaxies used up most of their gas to form stars in a
time short compared to their collapse time and if a roughly constant fraction
of metals is locked up in dust grains, these galaxies may easily become opaque
to starlight and emit most of their luminosity in the far-IR. The corresponding
spectral energy distribution matches remarkably well the observed continuum
spectrum of the ultraluminous galaxy IRAS F$10214+4724$ from UV to sub-mm
wavelengths, i.e. over almost four decades in frequency, for a galactic age
$\lsim 1\,$Gyr. The bolometric luminosity in this model is $\simeq 2.7\times
10^{14}\Lsol$ ($H_0 =50\,\hbox{km}\,\hbox{s}^{-1} \,\hbox{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega
=1$), i.e. somewhat lower than implied by previous models. In the present
framework, the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy is expected to decrease by a
factor $\gsim 30$ during the subsequent evolution.

Binary neutron stars merger (NS$^2$M) at cosmological distances is probably
the only $\gamma$-ray bursts model based on an independently observed
phenomenon which is known to be taking place at a comparable rate. We describe
this model, its predictions and some open questions.

The sudden release of copious $\g$-ray photons into a compact region creates
an opaque photon--lepton fireball due to the prolific production of
electron--positron pairs. The photons that we observe in the bursts emerge only
at the end of the fireball phase after it expanded sufficiently to become
optically thin or after it converted its energy to the kinetic energy of
relativistic baryons which convert it, in turn, to electromagnetic pulse via
the interaction with interstellar matter. It is essential, therefore, to
analyze the evolution of a fireball in order to comprehend the observed
features of $\gamma$-ray bursts. We discuss various aspects of fireball
hydrodynamics and the resulting emitted spectra.

We present 3D Newtonian simulations of the coalescence of two neutron stars,
using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We begin the simulations
with the two stars in a hard, circular binary, and have them spiral together as
angular momentum is lost through gravitational radiation at the rate predicted
by modeling the system as two point masses. We model the neutron stars as hard
polytropes ($\gamma=2.4$) of equal mass, and investigate the effect of the
initial spin of the two stars on the coalescence. The process of coalescence,
from initial contact to the formation of an axially symmetric object, takes
only a few orbital periods. Some of the material from the two neutron stars is
shed, forming a thick disk around the central, coalesced object. The mass of
this disk is dependent on the initial neutron star spins; higher spin rates
resulting in greater mass loss, and thus more massive disks. For spin rates
that are most likely to be applicable to real systems, the central coalesced
object has a mass of $2.4M_\odot$, which is tantalizingly close to the maximum
mass allowed by any neutron star equation of state for an object that is
supported in part by rotation. Using a realistic nuclear equation of state, we
estimate the temperature of the material after the coalescence. We find that
the central object is at a temperature of $\sim 10$MeV, whilst the disk is
heated by shocks to a temperature of 2-4MeV.

In this letter a new formula for light deflection is derived using only
physically observable concepts. The general result is specialized to
cosmological perturbation theory and expressed in terms of gauge--invariant
perturbation variables. The resulting scalar, vector and tensor equations are
supplemented by simple examples for illustration. The gravity wave example may
be of more than academic interest and even represent a new way to detect
gravitational waves.

We describe a refined calculation of high energy emission from
rotation-powered pulsars based on the Outer Gap model of Cheng, Ho \&~Ruderman
(1986a,b). We have improved upon previous efforts to model the spectra from
these pulsars (e. g. Cheng, et al. 1986b; Ho 1989) by following the variation
in particle production and radiation properties with position in the outer gap.
Curvature, synchrotron and inverse-Compton scattering fluxes vary significantly
over the gap and their interactions {\it via} photon-photon pair production
build up the radiating charge populations at varying rates. We have also
incorporated an approximate treatment of the transport of particle and photon
fluxes between gap emission zones. These effects, along with improved
computations of the particle and photon distributions, provide very important
modifications of the model gamma-ray flux. In particular, we attempt to make
specific predictions of pulse profile shapes and spectral variations as a
function of pulse phase and suggest further extensions to the model which may
provide accurate computations of the observed high energy emissions.

The measurements of the possible gravitational microlensing events are
analysed with a simple yet accurate disc--halo model of the Milky Way Galaxy.
This comprises a luminous exponential disc embedded in a flattened dark matter
halo with density varying like ${\rm distance}^{-1.8}$. Including a disc has
the important effect of lowering the implied masses of the dark matter objects.
For the possible detection reported by Alcock et al (1993), the inferred mass
of the lens lies in the range $\sim 0.01 - 0.15 M_\odot$. The candidate events
of Aubourg et al (1993) have slightly larger implied masses of $\sim 0.025 -
0.35\ M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.03 - 0.45\ M_\odot$ respectively. These are
consistent with the deflecters being either brown dwarfs or low mass stars. If
there is no disc dark matter and the halo is completely composed of baryonic
dark objects of typical mass $ \sim 0.08\ M_\odot$, then the monitoring of $1.8
\times 10^6$ stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud will provide at least $8-9$
detections a year, in the limit of $100 \%$ efficiency.

Earlier we had suggested that G10.0-0.3, a non-thermal nebula, most likely an
old supernova remnant (SNR), was associated with the soft gamma repeater (SGR)
SGR 1806-20. Here we present new radio images obtained at the Very Large Array
(VLA) of the non-thermal radio nebula G10.0-0.3. The nebula is a plerion with a
hierarchy of nested amorphous components culminating in a peak. The recent
dramatic detection of an X-ray point source coincident with the radio peak and
a hard X-ray burst localized to G10.0-0.3 confirms the SNR-SGR association. We
propose that the SGR is an isolated pulsar with both a steady and impulsive
relativistic particle wind and these two together power the nebula. We note
that both this SGR and SGR 0526-66 are offset from the centers of their SNRs
which requires high space motion of the pulsar. We suggest that some natal
mechanism produces high velocity and induces SGR activity.

We re-estimate the angular 2-point galaxy correlation function from the Lick
galaxy catalogue. We argue that the large-scale gradients observed in the Lick
catalogue are dominated by real clustering and therefore they should not be
subtracted prior to the estimation of the 2-p correlation function. We find
that if no such correction is introduced the galaxy correlations are perfectly
consistent with the those found in the APM survey. Thus, the long standing
discrepancy between the Lick and APM angular correlations is lifted.

After the detection of structure in the microwave sky, the characterization
of the observed features may be a useful guide to current and future
experiments. The first year COBE-DMR sky maps were analyzed in order to
identify the most significant hot and cold spots. The statistical significance
of potential spots of cosmic origin was evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations.
The area, eccentricity, and location of the most significant spots are given.

Models of population synthesis for the Galaxy have been developed in order to
understand galactic structure and evolution. They allow to test scenarii of
evolution by comparisons between model predictions and observed distributions.
Forthcoming near-infrared surveys will enormously increase the amount of
information about the distributions of late type stars in the Galaxy. We show
here how population synthesis models will help to analyse these surveys and to
interprete them in terms of mass function, star formation history and stellar
evolution.

Recently Lu presented tentative evidence for C IV lines in QSO Lyman-alpha
forest systems with strong lines. We have performed a similar search for C IV
in our 10 km/sec echelle spectra of the bright QSO HS~1946+7658. We shifted the
spectra to align the expected positions of the C IV lines in 65 Lyman-alpha
systems, then added them. The resulting composite spectrum, equivalent to 390
hours of exposure time on the Lick 3-m telescope, has a signal-to-noise ratio
of 80 per 0.025 Angstrom in the rest frame of the absorbers. We do not see any
C IV lines down to a $2\sigma$ limit of W$(1548) \leq 1.4 $~m\AA, about
one-fifth of the strength of the lines seen by Lu. The C IV lines which Lu saw
must be restricted to rare Lyman-alpha systems with large H I column densities
$\geq 10^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$, which are too rare to show C IV in our sample. More
common Lyman-alpha systems with H I column densities of $10^{13}$ --
$10^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$ do not show C IV lines. If their ionization is H/H~I $=
10^4$ then they have [C/H] $\leq -2.0$.

An imroved standard solar model, with more accurate input parameters and more
accurate treatment of plasma physics effects, predicts a solar neutrino flux
which is consistent within experimental uncertainties with the solar neutrino
observations after 1986.

The presence of an obscuring torus around the nucleus of Seyfert galaxies, as
supposed in the popular unification scheme, can strongly modify the X--ray
spectrum for both type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies. We find that if the torus is
Compton thick, it can scatter at small angles a significant fraction of the
nuclear radiation, and contribute to the continuum of Seyfert 1 galaxies above
$\sim$10 keV, and to the fluorescence iron line at 6.4 keV. At large
inclination angles and for large torus column densities, the spectrum is
attenuated by photoabsorption and Compton scattering, while the iron
fluorescence line produced by the torus can have large equivalent widths. Even
after dilution by the continuum scattered by the warm material outside the
torus, this iron line could be strong enough to explain the ``cold" component
in the spectrum of NGC 1068. We stress that the complex pattern of the
predicted variability can be a powerful tool for constraining the parameters of
the model, such as the column density of the torus, its inclination and the
amount of warm scattering material.

There are now a half dozen young pulsars detected in high energy photons by
the Compton GRO, showing a variety of emission efficiencies and pulse profiles.
We present here a calculation of the pattern of high energy emission on the sky
in a model which posits $\gamma$-ray production by charge depleted gaps in the
outer magnetosphere. This model accounts for the radio to $\gamma$-ray pulse
offsets of the known pulsars, as well as the shape of the high energy pulse
profiles. We also show that $\sim 1/3$ of emitting young radio pulsars will not
be detected due to beaming effects, while $\sim 2.5 \times$ the number of
radio-selected $\gamma$-ray pulsars will be viewed only high energies. Finally
we compute the polarization angle variation and find that the previously
misunderstood optical polarization sweep of the Crab pulsar arises naturally in
this picture. These results strongly support an outer-magnetosphere location
for the $\gamma-$ray emission.

A gravitationally lensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) would appear as multiple
bursts with identical light curves, separated in time and differing only by the
scaling of their amplitudes. However, noise may make them difficult to identify
as lensed images. Furthermore, faint, intrinsically similar, yet distinct light
curves may be falsely identified as lensing events. In this paper we develop
two statistical tests to distinguish noisy burst light curves. We use Fourier
analysis techniques to analyze the signals for both intrinsic variability and
variability due to noise. We are able to determine the noise level, and we
compare the bursts only at frequency channels that are signal dominated.
Utilizing these methods, we are able to make quantitative statements about
whether two bursts are distinct. We apply these statistics to scaled versions
of two subbursts of GRB 910503--- subbursts previously investigated by
Wambsganss (1993) using a different statistical test. We find that our methods
are able to distinguish these bursts at slightly smaller amplitudes than those
at which Wambsganss's method succeeds. We then apply our techniques to
``candidate" lensing events taken from the BATSE catalogue, and we find that
nearly all of them, except for the very shortest ones (durations $\aproxlt 0.3
~s$), are distinguishable. We therefore expect that a majority of bursts will
be disinguishable from one another.

Possibly the only unambiguous verification that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are
at cosmological distances would be the observation of multiple images of a
gravitationally lensed burst. Each images would arrive at a different time, but
exhibit identical light curves. We improve upon previous calculations of GRB
lensing by using revised cosmological burst models based upon better knowledge
of burst spectra, and we consider several sets of cosmological parameters. Only
lensing by the known population of galaxies is considered, and we compute the
lensing rate and amplification bias using three different lens models. Assuming
that 800 bursts per year are above the detection threshold of the BATSE
experiment on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, we predict one lensing event
every 1.5--25 years, with a median time delay between images of about 7 days.
However, BATSE has an instrumental efficiency of about 12\% for detecting
double bursts, decreasing the detection rate to fewer than one per century for
some cosmological parameters. This inefficiency can be overcome partially if
cases of quadruple imaging by elliptical potentials are common, but simulations
show that lensing by elliptical potentials enhances the detection rate by only
about 20\%. We conclude that it is unlikely that the BATSE experiment will
detect a lensed burst, but that a future experiment, which is either much more
sensitive or has a much more efficient duty cycle, could.

As was shown before (Gurzadyan and Kocharyan, 1992, 1993ab) the statistical
properties (exponential mixing) of motion of CMB photon beams in Friedmann
Universe with negative curvature can have definite observable consequences
including the decrease of the CMB anisotropy amplitude after the last
scattering, distortion of images on CMB sky maps. Here we consider one more
consequence concerning the behaviour of temperature autocorrelation function
C(\theta,\beta), where \theta is the modulation (separation) angle, and \beta
the observing beam effective angle. We prove that in the Universe with negative
curvature any spectrum of perturbations at last scattering epoch becomes a
scale-invariant by present time. It is also predicted that the temperature
autocorrelation function should increase while obtained from measurements with
small beam sizes within some mixing beam angle.

The reconstruction of the peculiar velocity field from the 1.936~Jy iras
selected sample of galaxies is compared to a similar reconstruction from an
optically selected sample. A general method for combining different samples to
reconstruct a self-consistent density and peculiar velocity field is presented.
The method is applied to determine how sensitive the derived peculiar velocity
field is to the characteristics of the sample used. The possibility that the
iras galaxies do not trace the general galaxy population is explored adopting a
simple model of linear biasing between the iras and optical samples. We find
that the velocity fields derived from the two samples are consistent, within
the estimated shot noise error, for the case of no relative bias. This result
suggests that the predicted peculiar velocity field based on iras samples is
not sensitive to the sampling properties of iras galaxies. Combined with
previous suggestion of a relative biasing of iras galaxies on small scales
(about 5 h^-1Mpc), this result suggests scale dependent biasing.

A sample of faint, V magnitude selected, galaxy pairs, having physical
separations less than approximately 20\hkpc, is used to examine the rise in the
merger rate with redshift and the statistical relations between close pairs and
the field galaxy population. Redshifts have been obtained for 14 galaxies ($V
\le 22.5$) that are in close ($\theta < 6\arcs$) pairs, along with a comparison
sample of 38 field galaxies. Two color photometry is available for about 1000
galaxies in the same fields. The average redshift of the $V\le22.5$ field
population is 0.36, statistically equal to the average redshift of 0.42 for the
pairs. The similarity of the two redshift distributions, $\Delta z\le 0.1$,
limits any differential luminosity enhancement of close pairs to less than half
a magnitude. The pairs are somewhat bluer than the field and have nearly twice
the average [O~II] detection rate of the field, but the differences are not
statistically significant. The field population has an angular correlation at
separations of $\theta\le$6\arcs\ higher than the inward extrapolation of
$\omega(\theta)\propto \theta^{-0.8}$, which may be a population of
``companions'' not present at the current epoch, or, luminosity enhancement of
intrinsically faint galaxies in pairs. Physical pairs comprise about 7\% of the
faint galaxies in our survey fields. The same physical separation applied to
local galaxies finds only 2.6\% in pairs. If the rise in close low relatively
velocity pairs with redshift is parameterized as $(1+z)^m$, then $m=2.9\pm0.8$.
If all pairs at low velocities and $r\le 20$\hkpc\ merge, then the

We present a detailed prescription for how galaxy formation can be modelled
in hierarchical theories of structure formation. Our model incorporates the
formation and merging of dark matter halos, the shock heating and radiative
cooling of baryonic gas gravitationally confined in these halos, the formation
of stars regulated by the energy released by evolving stars and supernovae, the
merging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution of the
stellar populations that are formed. The procedure that we describe is very
flexible and can be applied to any hierarchical clustering theory. We explore
the effects of varying the stellar initial mass function, star formation rates
and galaxy merging. The results we compare with an extensive range of
observational data, including the B and K galaxy luminosity functions, galaxy
colours, the Tully-Fisher relation and galaxy number counts.These data strongly
constrain the models and enable the relative importance of each of the physical
process to be assessed. We present a broadly successful model defined by a
plausible choice of parameters. This fiducial model produces a much more
acceptable luminosity function than most previous studies. This is achieved
through a modest rate of galaxy mergers and strong suppression of star
formation in halos of low circular velocity. However, it fails to produce
galaxies as red as many observed ellipticals and, compared with the observed
Tully-Fisher relation, the model galaxies have circular velocities which are
too large. ** uuencoded compressed postscript file containing all text and

We propose that the recently reported MACHO/EROS events correspond to
gravitational amplification by dark clouds rather than compact objects. These
clouds must be very dense with $M\sim 0.1 ~M_\odot$ and $R\la 10^{14}~{\rm
cm}$. In all likelihood, the clouds will be members of a family of objects with
different sizes and masses. We therefore expect events of longer duration than
the ones reported by the MACHO and EROS groups but with light curves very
different from the ones derived assuming point mass lenses. We suggest that one
such event has already been observed in radio measurements of the quasar
1502+106. The abundances of free electrons, metals, complex molecules, and dust
grains are constrained to be very small suggesting that the clouds are formed
from a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium. Cosmic rays and background UV
radiation ionize a halo around the cloud. Radio waves from distant sources will
be scattered by the electrons in this halo, an effect which may have already
been observed in quasars such as 1502+106. We argue that dark clouds are a
viable alternative to compact objects for baryonic dark matter in the halo.

We present preliminary results of our investigation into the influence of
shear fields on the evolution of galactic scale fluctuations in a primordial
Gaussian random density field. Specifically, we study how the matter associated
with a galaxy-scale peak evolves, to determine whether the shear can affect the
peak's ability to form a virialized structure. We find that the evolution of
the mass distribution in the immediate surroundings of $\geq 1\sigma$ initial
density peaks is sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the shear. Its final
fate and configuration spans a plethora of possibilities, ranging from
accretion onto the peak to complete disruption. On the other hand, the mass
defining the peak itself always tends to form a virialized object, though a
given galaxy-scale peak need not necessarily form only one halo. Furthermore,
galaxy-size halos need not necessarily be associated with initial galaxy-scale
density peaks. Under certain conditions, the shear field is capable of breaking
up a single primordial peak into two (and perhaps, more) distinct halos, or of
promoting the growth of smaller-scale peaks into galaxy-size halos.

We have investigated the IRAS colours and the far-IR to optical luminosity
ratios of a complete sample of elliptical's and S0's brighter than $B_T = 12$.
On the average, elliptical galaxies emit in the far-IR less than 1\% of their
bolometric luminosity, while S0's are about a factor of three brighter in the
far-IR. On the average, the photospheric emission of red giant stars can
account for 50--60\% of the $12\mic$ flux from early type galaxies; the
contribution from diffuse dust at this wavelength is $< 10\%$ in the case of
ellipticals,and may amount to 20--40\% for S0's. An additional, $\sim
30--40\%$, contribution from circumstellar emission from evolved giants with
mass loss (particularly OH/IR stars) seems to be required in the case of
ellipticals. This suggests a small but significant star formation activity in
these galaxies at a look-back time of 1--$2\,$Gyr, corresponding to about 10\%
of that typical of a disk galaxy having the same V-band luminosity. As for
S0's, the larger diffuse dust emission may swamp to some extent that of
circumstellar dust, which is indicated to be, on the average, $\lsim 20\%$. The
weak emission from diffuse interstellar dust, detected mostly at $60\mic$ and
$100\mic$, has color temperatures similar to those of disk galaxies; as in that
case of the latter, a warm dust component is suggested, associated to
star-forming regions. The implied star formation would be a few percent of that
of disk galaxies of similar V-band luminosity and could account for a fraction
of the observed UV branch of early type galaxies.

We have searched the temperature maps from the COBE Differential Microwave
Radiometers (DMR) first two years of data for evidence of unresolved sources.
The high-latitude sky (|b| > 30\deg) contains no sources brighter than 192 uK
thermodynamic temperature (322 Jy at 53 GHz). The cumulative count of sources
brighter than threshold T, N(> T), is consistent with a superposition of
instrument noise plus a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmic temperature
fluctuations normalized to Qrms-PS = 17 uK. We examine the temperature maps
toward nearby clusters and find no evidence for any Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,
\Delta y < 7.3 x 10^{-6} (95% CL) averaged over the DMR beam. We examine the
temperature maps near the brightest expected radio sources and detect no
evidence of significant emission. The lack of bright unresolved sources in the
DMR maps, taken with anisotropy measurements on smaller angular scales, places
a weak constraint on the integral number density of any unresolved
Planck-spectrum sources brighter than flux density S, n(> S) < 2 x 10^4 (S/1
Jy)^{-2} sr^{-1}.

The unusually large eccentricity ($e_1=0.025$) of the low-mass binary
millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26 can be explained naturally as arising from the
secular perturbation of a second, more distant companion. Such a triple
configuration has been proposed recently as the most likely cause of the
anomalous second period derivative of the pulsar. The current timing data are
consistent with a second companion mass $m_2$ as low as $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$,
i.e., comparable to that of Jupiter. However, {\em if\/} the eccentricity is
indeed produced by secular perturbations, then the second companion must be
another star, most likely of mass $m_2\lo1M_\odot$ and in a very eccentric
($e_2\go0.5$) orbit of period $P_2\sim10^2$--$10^3\,$yr. A second companion of
planetary mass cannot induce the observed eccentricity. Independent of the mass
of the second companion, small changes in the binary pulsar's orbit should
become detectable with just a few additional years of timing data. This
detection would provide direct confirmation of the triple nature of the system,
and an accurate measurement of the effects would place important new
constraints on the orbital parameters.

We consider the inner regions of accretion disks surrounding black holes and
neutron stars and investigate the nonlinear time dependent evolution of
thermal-viscous instabilities. The viscous stress is assumed to be proportional
to the gas pressure with the viscosity parameter formulated as $\alpha
=\min[\alpha_0 (h/r)^n, \alpha_{\max}]$, where $h$ is the local scale height,
$r$ is the distance from the central compact object, and $n$, $\alpha_0$ and
$\alpha_{\max}$ are constants. It is found that the disk is unstable for
$\alpha$ sufficiently sensitive to $h$ ($n \gapprox 1.2$). The instabilities
are globally coherent in the entire unstable region of the disk and, depending
on the viscosity parameters, the time variability of the mass accretion rates
are manifested as periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations. We show that, the
low frequency ($\sim 0.04$~Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) discovered
recently in some of the black hole candidates (Cyg~X-1 and GRO~J0422+32) and a
low mass X-ray binary (Rapid Burster MXB~1730--335) may be explicable by the
thermal-viscous instabilities in accretion disks. The observations of QPOs
place constraints on the viscosity parameters and suggest that $(n,\alpha_0)$
$\sim (1.6,30)$ for the Rapid Burster with a $1.4\,\msun$ neutron star. In the
case of black hole candidates, the dependence of $\alpha$ on $h/r$ is less
steep corresponding to $n \sim 1.2-1.3$ for black holes less than $10\,\msun$.

More than 100 gamma-ray burst progenitor models have now been published in
refereed journals. A list of the models published before the end of 1992 is
presented and briefly discussed. The consensus of the present astronomical
community remains that no specific model is particularly favored for cosmic
bursts. Recent BATSE results make most of these models untenable in their
present form, opening up the field to another era of speculative papers. Is
speculation in this area becoming valueless? Alternatively, one may argue that
the new data makes many of the old models untenable, and simply adapting old
models may not be sufficient. With this in mind, three relatively unexplored
"toy" paradigms are suggested from which more detailed models for the
progenitors of gamma-ray bursts may be made.

We demonstrate that there is only one physical process required to explain
the spectrum and the variability of the radio source at the dynamical center of
our Galaxy, Sgr A*, in the frequency range from $\approx$1 to $\approx$1000
GHz, namely optically thin synchrotron radiation that is emitted from a
population of relativistic electrons. We attribute the observed variability to
variable energy input from an accretion disk around Sgr A* into the
acceleration of the electrons.

We examine the constraints on theories of galaxy formation that are obtained
from observations of damped $\lya$ (DL) systems, assuming they are gaseous
protodisks in dark matter halos. Using the Press-Schechter formalism, we find
that the mixed dark matter model, with $\ohdm = 0.3$, $\ocdm = 0.65$, $\obaryon
= 0.05$, and $h=0.5$, is ruled out because the number of galactic halos at
$z\simeq 3$ is too small to account for the total gaseous mass in DL systems,
even under the assumption that all the gas in collapsed halos has settled into
disks of neutral gas. The standard CDM model can account for the gas in DL
systems if the bias is $b\lsim 2$; the same is true for the CDM model with a
cosmological constant, if $b\lsim 1.5$ for $\Lambda = 0.8$. However, one still
needs to assume that a fraction $\gsim 0.4$ of the baryons in collapsed halos
at $z\simeq 3$ is in the form of neutral gas in disks. We also calculate the
column density distribution $f(\nhi)$ of the DL systems, in terms of the
surface density profiles of disks and the distribution of their central column
densities. It is shown that the form of $f(\nhi)$ at the high end of column
density is a diagnostic for the nature of DL systems.

There is accumulating observational evidence suggesting that damped
Ly$\alpha$ absorption systems systems are the progenitors of present-day spiral
galaxies. We use the observed properties of these systems to place constraints
on the history of star formation in galactic disks, and on cosmological
theories of structure formation in the universe. We show that the observed
increase in $\Omega_{HI}$ contributed by damped Ly$\alpha$ systems at high
redshift implies that star formation must have been considerably less efficient
in the past. We also show that the data can constrain cosmological models in
which structure forms at late epochs. A mixed dark matter (MDM) model with
$\Omega_{\nu}=0.3$ is unable to reproduce the mass densities of cold gas seen
at high redshift, even in the absence of any star formation. We show that at
redshifts greater than 3, this model predicts that the total baryonic mass
contained in dark matter halos with circular velocities $V_c > 35$ km s$^{-1}$
is less than the observed mass of HI in damped systems. At these redshifts, the
photo-ionizing background would prevent gas from dissipating and collapsing to
form high column density systems in halos smaller than 35 km s$^{-1}$. MDM
models are thus ruled out by the observations.

We present new optical and infrared photometric observations and high
resolution H$\alpha$ spectra of the periodic radio star \lsi. The optical
photometric data set covers the time interval 1985-1993 and amounts to about a
hundred nights. A period of $\sim$26 days is found in the V band. The infrared
data also present evidence for a similar periodicity, but with higher amplitude
of variation (0\rmag 2). The spectroscopic observations include 16 intermediate
and high dispersion spectra of \lsi\ collected between January 1989 and
February 1993. The H$\alpha$ emission line profile and its variations are
analyzed. Several emission line parameters -- among them the H$\alpha$ EW and
the width of the H$\alpha$ red hump -- change strongly at or close to radio
maximum, and may exhibit periodic variability. We also observe a significant
change in the peak separation. The H$\alpha$ profile of \lsi\ does not seem
peculiar for a Be star. However, several of the observed variations of the
H$\alpha$ profile can probably be associated with the presence of the compact,
secondary star.

We have made angular broadening measurements in the satellite line of the OH
molecule at 1612 MHz of 8 OH/IR stars located near the Galactic Center with the
Very Large Array. Early observations with the Very Long Baseline Array had
revealed a region of pronounced scattering approximately centered on SgrA*.
These new observations show that the compact line emission from these stars is
scattered by an amount that is two to three times larger than had been
previously seen. Additionally, we measure non-circular scattering disks for
these objects, evidence that the electron density variations are distributed
anisotropically. The present data suggest that the enhanced turbulence is
located near the Galactic Center. However, we cannot completely rule out that
the scattering is caused by an unrelated region along the line of sight.

The paper presents results for deriving closed-form analytic solutions of the
non-relativistic linear perturbation equations, which govern the evolution of
inhomogeneities in a homogeneous spatially flat multicomponent cosmological
model. Mathematical methods to derive computable forms of the perturbations are
outlined.

As theoretical knowledge and experimental verification of nuclear cross
sections increases it becomes possible to refine analytic representations for
nuclear reaction rates. In this paper mathematical/statistical techniques for
deriving closed-form representations of thermonuclear functions are summarized
and numerical results for them are given.The purpose of the paper is also to
compare numerical results for approximate and closed-form representations of
thermonuclear functions.

New high resolution 6 cm observations have been made on Cepheus A using
MERLIN, and combined with new VLA observations at 3.7 cm. Angular resolution
with the latter was 200 mas, and with MERLIN was 60 mas, except for isolated
unresolved sources where 33 mas was achieved. Unresolved objects at 60 mas were
observed in Sources 2, 3, and in particular 9 which also was not resolved at 33
mas. There is no evidence for any other object as small as this with any
significant flux density, although Source 8 was quiescent at the time. The
upper limit to the size of Source 9 sets a minimum brightness temperature of
4.3 $\times$ 10$^5$K, and adds credence to a previous suggestion that it is a
gyrosynchrotron source. The compact objects of Sources 2 and 3 are thought to
be produced by mass outflow from stars, which could be of spectral type B0 -
B1, but this is uncertain. There is a discussion regarding the powerhouse for
the molecular outflow. Sources 8 and 9, which are the highly time dependent
objects, appear at the centre of the disruption of the high density gas, and
their estimated high temperature of 10$^7$ - 10$^8$K indicates that they could
produce high velocity winds. On the other hand, the OH masers surrounding
Source 2(ii) show an outward velocity of about 10 km s${-1}$, which is small,
but higher velocity winds could tunnel through adjacent spaces, and even be
responsible for the 300 km s${-1}$ bullet of Source 7. An extrapolation of the
orthogonals to the IR polarization vectors are not accurate enough to pinpoint
the source of the IR radiation, but it is estimated that Sources 2(ii) and
3(d)(ii) could

ABSRACT: We review recent progress on testing the hypothesis of the existence
of cosmic string perturbations in microwave background maps. Using an
analytical model for the string network we show that the predicted amplitude
and spectrum of MBR fluctuations are consistent with the COBE data for a
reasonable value of the single free parameter of the string model (the mass per
unit length of the string $\mu$). To {\it distinguish} the predictions of
cosmic strings from those of Gaussian models it is necessary to apply specific
{\it statistical tests} which are sensitive to non-random phases of the MBR
temperature maps. We discuss two such statistical tests: First, the probability
distribution and the moments of fluctuations ${{\delta T}\over T}$ and second
the corresponding statistical quantities for the {\it gradient} of fluctuations
along a fixed direction. We show that the second statistic can detect cosmic
string specific signatures on MBR temperature maps with resolution of a few
arcminutes or smaller.

The color-magnitude diagram of $ \sim 3 \times 10^5 $ stars obtained for
Baade's Window towards the Galactic bulge with the OGLE project reveals a
surprisingly narrow main sequence due to galactic disk stars at a distance of
$d \sim 2 $ kpc, i.e. at the location of the Sagittarius spiral arm. A more
careful analysis indicates there is an excess in the number of disk stars by a
factor $\sim 2$ between us and $d \sim 2.5$ kpc and a rapid drop by a factor
$\sim 10$ beyond that distance. It is unlikely that the observed structure is
an artifact of the interstellar extinction, but careful determination of the
extinction is needed before the structure is firmly established. The narrow
main sequence extends down to stars as faint as $M_{_V} \approx 7$, i.e. it is
composed of old stars. This is not expected in a conventional disk model, or in
a conventional model of a spiral structure. However, a strong concentration of
old stars towards spiral arms has been noticed in some other galaxies, like M51
(Rix \& Rieke 1993), with the near infrared surface photometry. We have also
found that the relative distribution of red clump and red giant stars in the
Galactic bulge implies that there is a relatively young stellar population
present there.

The rotation curves of 20 spiral galaxies are examined in the light of a toy
model (Soares 1992) which has as the main feature the assignment of a high M/L
ratio (=30; Ho=50 km/s/Mpc) to the visible matter. The observed rotation of all
galaxies can be accommodated without the assumption of a dark halo.
  Moreover, the suggestion is made that the fact that almost all available
rotational velocity measurements are derived from emission lines emitted by
galaxian gas (either neutral or ionized) makes them inappropriate as tracers of
the galaxy gravitational potential. To account for that, the model introduces
an effective potential meant to describe the hydrodynamics inside a gaseous
disk. The general morphology of the curves (i.e., the presence of a plateau in
V(r) X r) is interpreted in this framework as a consequence of the
hydrodynamical characteristics of galaxian disks.
  The Tully-Fisher relation is expressed in terms of model parameters and used
as an additional constraint in the process of fitting the model to the observed
rotation of the galaxies.

The dark matter in Galactic halos, or some fraction of it, may be in the form
of dark clusters which consist of small mass objects. Carr & Lacey (1987) have
derived the permissible properties of such systems, and proposed the existence
of dark clusters with mass of order $10^6\solarmass$ to explain some of the
observed dynamical properties of the stellar disk of the Galaxy. A population
of bound systems with mass of $\sim 10^5-10^6\solarmass$ is also an attractive
possibility since it is close to the baryon Jeans mass at recombination, which
may be the preferred mass scale for the first bound objects to form in the
universe. At the present, the existence of dark clusters which consist of brown
dwarfs, Jupiters, or black hole remnants of an early generation of stars, is
not indicated, nor can be excluded on observational grounds.
  We describe how dark clusters can be discovered in a sample of gravitational
microlensing events in LMC stars. Alternatively, it could provide strict bounds
on the fraction of halo mass which resides in such systems. If MACHOs are
clustered, the implied degeneracy in their spatial and velocity distributions
would result in a strong autocorrelation in the sky position of microlensing
events on an angular scale $\lesssim 20$ arcsec, along with a correlation in
the event duration.
  We argue that a small number of events could be enough to indicate the
existence of clusters, and demonstrate that a sample of $\simeq 10$ events
would be sufficient to reject the proposal of Carr & Lacey (1987) at the $95\%$
confidence level.

The cold dark matter (CDM) scenario for structure formation in the Universe
is very attractive and has many successes; however, when its spectrum of
density perturbations is normalized to the COBE anisotropy measurement the
level of inhomogeneity predicted on small scales is too large. This can be
remedied by a tau neutrino of mass $1\MeV - 10\MeV$ and lifetime $0.1\sec -
100\sec$ whose decay products include electron neutrinos because it allows the
total energy density in relativistic particles to be doubled without
interfering with nucleosynthesis. The anisotropies predicted on the degree
scale for ``$\tau$CDM'' are larger than standard CDM. Experiments at $e^\pm$
colliders may be able to probe such a mass range.

Experiments are looking for diffuse brown dwarfs in the dark galactic halo
through the gravitational lens effect. If brown dwarfs are clumped in dark
clusters, the event rate is not changed, but events are spatially clustered,
and stars nearby a micro-lensed one are likely to be micro-lensed in a near
future. Therefore, an intensive survey of the region where a micro-lensing
occurred should reveal many other events.

A detailed study of the mixed-morphology galaxy pair CPG 29 (Arp 119, VV 347)
shows spectacular spectroscopic peculiarities in the southern (spiral)
component (Mkn 984) including a spatially resolved region, roughly aligned
along the minor axis of the galaxy, with multiple emission-line components
redshifted by as much as 1300 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the LINER nucleus.
Strong [OI]\l6300 and [SII]\l\l6716,6731 emission suggest shock ionization. The
rest of the galaxy's disk is spectroscopically undistinguished, with emission
lines characteristic of disk H II regions and, in large part, ordered rotation.
We discuss the following four possible explanations for the morphological and
spectroscopic peculiarities in the spiral: (1) a super--wind scenario,
supported by the high FIR luminosity of the spiral, and by emission line
activity similar to that observed in FIR strong galaxies; (2) motion of the
spiral through a hot, relatively dense intergalactic medium, possibly
associated with the elliptical, that could affect the star formation rate and
create a brightened disk rim; (3) a faint companion in direct collision with
the disk, at $\Delta v_r \sim 1000$ \kms, that would straightforwardly explain
the existence of the different redshift systems; (4) a pole on collision by the
elliptical, that could produce the disturbed morphology and other properties of
the spiral. The elliptical/spiral pole--on collision explains the high velocity
line emitting regions as tidally stripped gas, and accounts for the presence of
gas ionized by moterate velocity shocks. The morphology of Mrk 984 is
consistent

The Sachs-Wolfe effect is known to produce large angular scale fluctuations
in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) due to gravitational
potential fluctuations. We show how the angular correlation function of the
CMBR can be expressed explicitly in terms of the mass autocorrelation function
$\xi (r)$ in the Universe. We derive analytic expressions for the angular
correlation function and its multipole moments in terms of integrals over $\xi
(r)$ or its second moment, $J_3 (r)$, which does not need to satisfy the sort
of integral constraint that $\xi (r)$ must. We derive similar expressions for
bulk flow velocity in terms of $\xi$ and $J_3$. One interesting result that
emerges directly from this analysis is that, for angles $\theta$, there is a
substantial contribution to the correlation function from a wide range of
distance $r$ and that the radial shape of this contribution does not vary
greatly with angle.

We explore the possibility of describing our universe with a
singularity--free, closed, spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological
model, using only general relativity and a suitable equation of state which
produces an inflationary era. A phase transition to a radiation--dominated era
occurs as a consequence of boundary conditions expressing the assumption that
the temperature cannot exceed the Planck value. We find that over a broad range
of initial conditions, the predicted value of the Hubble parameter is
approximately $47$ km$\cdot$~s$^{-1}\cdot$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Inflation is driven by a
scalar field, which must be conformally coupled to the curvature if the
Einstein equivalence principle has to be satisfied. The form of the scalar
field potential is derived, instead of being assumed a priori.

We simulate the propagation of a shock front through the galactic halo
induced by an explosion and/or a starburst at the galactic center. A huge
dumbbell ($\Omega$)-shaped shock front produced by an explosion of energy
$3\times 10^{56}$ ergs about fifteen million years ago can mimic the radio and
X-ray North Polar Spur as well the southern large X-ray spur. The post-shock
high-temperature gas in the corona will explain the observed X-ray bulge around
the galactic center. Key workds Galaxy: center -- Galaxy: halo -- Radio

A measure of the average depression between Lyman absorption lines in the
spectrum of the faint quasar BR1202-0725 ($z_{em}=4.695$) is presented. The
relatively high resolution of the spectrum ($\sim 40$ km s$^{-1}$) allows the
selection of regions free of strong absorption lines in the Lyman alpha forest.
A reliable evaluation of the continuum shape is based on the careful flux
calibration and on the large wavelength interval covered (5000--9300 ~\AA). A
best estimate of $\tau _{_{GP}}\leq 0.02\pm 0.03$ has been found for the
Gunn-Peterson optical depth at the highest absorption redshift observed at this
resolution, $z \simeq 4.3$. The derived baryon density of the intergalactic
medium is $\Omega _{IGM}\mincir 0.01$ if the observed quasars are the major
contributor to the ionizing UV background flux. This limit, when compared with
the total baryon density deduced from the nucleosynthesis, could imply that
most of the baryons are already in bound systems at $z\sim 5$.

The MS1224+20 cluster of galaxies is a high luminosity X-ray source at
z=0.325. To compare the lensing mass to the virial mass we have completed a
uniform, high precision redshift survey over a field of $7\arcm\times9\arcm$,
obtaining 75 redshifts. The velocity dispersion of 30 cluster galaxies is $775$
\kms\ and the projected harmonic radius is 0.32 \hmpc. The virial mass is
$2.1\times 10^{14} h^{-1} \msun$. Correcting for faint cluster galaxies without
redshifts and allowing for a modest evolution in the galaxy luminosity function
gives a current epoch mass-to-light ratio $M/L_V(0)=255h \msun/\lsun$. The same
field contains a $z=0.225$ cluster with $\sigma_v\simeq 500$ \kms, and a group
at $z=0.412$ with $\sigma_v\simeq 400$ \kms. The clusters' gravitational field
induces image ellipticities that are calculated from the light-traces-mass
density distribution and compared to the observed average tangential
distortions from Fahlman \et (1994). Between 1.5 and 3 virial radii, the
observed lensing distortions are $4\pm2$ times stronger than the
light-traces-mass model and the virial M/L predict.

We discuss the applicability and derivation of window functions for cosmic
microwave background experiments on large and intermediate angular scales.
These window functions describe the response of the experiment to power in a
particular mode of the fluctuation spectrum. We give general formulae,
illustrated with specific examples, for the most common observing strategies.

We discuss a method for a model independent reconstruction of the CMB
temperature fluctuation power spectrum on small and intermediate scales that is
geared to individual experiments. The importance of off-diagonal correlations
for determining the shape of the power spectrum is emphasized and some examples
of a reconstruction method are given. By using this method to ``map'' the power
spectrum on the scales to which they are sensitive several experiments could be
combined to map out the full power spectrum, and test consistency of observed
features. For example we find that the GUM scan of the 3rd flight of the MAX
experiment prefers a positive slope to the power spectrum near $\ell\simeq160$,
which provides weak evidence for the presence of a Doppler peak.

(accepted for publication in the Ap.J.) I present a general classification of
self-similar solutions to the equations of gravitational hydrodynamics that
contain many previous results as special cases. For cold flows with spherical
symmetry, the solution space can be classified into several regions of behavior
similar to the Bondi solutions for steady flow. A full description of these
solution is possible, which serves as the asymptotic limit for the general
problem. By applying a shock jump condition, exact general solutions can be
constructed. The isothermal case allows an extra exact integral, and can be
asymptotically analyzed in the presence of finite pressure. These solutions
serve as analytic models for problems such as spherical accretion for star
formation, infall or outflow of gas into galaxies, Lyman alpha cloud dynamics,
etc. Most previous self-similar results are obtained as special cases. The
critical values for a cosmological flow with $\Omega=1$ and $\gamma=4/3$ turn
out to play a special role.

We estimate the contribution of galaxies to the cosmological density Omega_0
including also their extended dark halos. We find Omega_gal< 0.1, so implying
that the matter in galaxies cannot by itself close the Universe but marginally
could be baryonic. (latex file)two figures available upon request).

We present convenient formulae for the energy losses of energetic atomic
nuclei over the entire energy range relevant to the physics of cosmic rays.
Results are applied to a leaky-box equation with a complete loss term. Thereby
we derive the equilibrium spectrum of cosmic rays in various types of galaxies.
We emphasize a spectral break energy at 450 MeV independent of the matter
density, resulting from the transition from Coulomb and ionization losses to
pion production losses as the relevant cooling process for the cosmic ray
nuclei . We comment on the possible cosmic ray origin of the cosmic gamma ray
background.

The natural outcome of theoretical calculations of microwave background
anisotropy is the angular power spectrum ${\cal C}_\ell$ as a function of
multipole number $\ell$. Experimental ${\cal C}_\ell$'s are needed for direct
comparison. Estimation procedures using statistics linear in the pixel
amplitudes as well as the conventional but less useful quadratic combinations
are described. For most current experiments, a single broad-band power
amplitude is all that one can get with accuracy. Results are given for the
Capri-meeting detections. Mapping experiments, sensitive to many base-lines,
can also give spectral ``colour'' information, either with a series of
contiguous narrow-band powers or as parameterized by a local ``colour'' index
$n_{\Delta T}$ (scale invariant is -2, white noise is 0). Bayesian analyses of
the full first year DMR and FIRS maps give very similar band-powers (\eg
$Q_{rms,PS}=17.9 \pm 2.9 \mu K$ {\it c.f.} $18.6 \pm 4.7 \mu K$ for $n_{\Delta
T}=-2$) and colour indices (with 1 and 2 sigma error bars) $n_{\Delta
T}+3=2.0^{+0.4;+0.7}_{-0.4;-1.0}$ and $ 1.8^{+0.6;+0.9}_{-0.8;-1.3}$ ({\it
c.f.} the value 1.15 for a ``standard'' scale invariant CDM model). The 53 and
90 GHz DMR maps, as well as the FIRS map, have residual short-distance noise
which steepens $n_{\Delta T}$. Allowing the pixel error bars to increase
absorbs much of the residual, but further exploration is needed to see if a
second residual evident in the data which is responsible for the high
$n_{\Delta T}$ is from systematic errors or is physical.

(To appear in Nuclear Physics B Supplements Proceedings section) This talk
will explore the evolution of topological defects in an open universe. The
rapid expansion of the universe in an open model slows defects and suppresses
the generation of CBR fluctuations at large angular scale as does the altered
relationship between angle and length in an open universe. Defect models, when
normalized to COBE in an open universe, predict a galaxy power spectrum
consistent with the galaxy power spectrum inferred from the galaxy surveys and
do not require an extreme bias. Neither defect models in a flat universe nor
standard inflationary models can fit either the multipole spectrum or the power
spectrum inferred from galaxy surveys.

%The content of this replacement paper is identical to the original. %We have
attempted to fix the postscript so that it will print out on %a larger number
of printers. Using recent experimental limits on $\mu$ distortions from COBE
FIRAS, and the large lever-arm spanning the damping of sub-Jeans scale
fluctuations to the scale of the COBE DMR fluctuations, we set a constraint on
the slope of the primordial power spectrum $n$. It is possible to analytically
calculate the contribution over the full range of scales and redshifts,
correctly taking into account fluctuation growth and damping as well as
thermalization processes. We find that the 95\% upper limit is weakly dependent
on cosmological parameters, e.g. $n<1.54 (h=0.5)$ and $n<1.56 (h=1.0)$ for
$\Omega_0=1$ with marginally weaker constraints for $\Omega_0<1$ in a flat
$\Omega_0 +\Omega_\Lambda=1$ universe.

We present the case that populations of sdB/sdOB/sdO-type stars may be a
common constituent of galactic stellar populations, responsible for the UV
upturn (`UVX') observed in the spectra of spiral bulges and normal galaxy
nuclei. Extreme Horizontal Branch stars with $\log g > 5$ and $\log \teff >
20,000K$ have emerged in the last few years as the most likely candidate for
the origin of the UVX. The magnitude of this far-UV flux in some systems (e.g.
NGC~1399, NGC~4649) indicates that galactic nuclear regions must contain larger
numbers of these subdwarfs than does the solar neighbourhood. This paper
summarizes the results of a quantitative study of the UV radiation from evolved
stellar populations. We have computed a large grid of stellar models in
advanced stages of evolution, as well as a set of isochrones for ages 2-20 Gyr,
for a wide range in composition. We use these calculations to derive synthetic
UV colour indices for stellar populations with hot components.

We consider whether the hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission from Centaurus
A is beamed radiation from the active nucleus which is Compton-scattered into
our line-of-sight. We derive the spectrum and degree of polarization of
scattered radiation when incident beamed radiation is scattered from a cold
($kT<<m_ec^2$) electron cloud moving with bulk relativistic motion along the
jet axis, and calculate results for an unpolarized, highly-beamed incident
power-law photon source. We fit the OSSE data from Centaurus A with this model
and find that if the scatterers are not moving relativistically, then the angle
the jet makes with respect to our line-of-sight is $61^\circ\pm 5^\circ$. We
predict a high degree of polarization of the scattered radiation below
$\sim300$ keV. Future measurements with X-ray and gamma-ray polarimeters could
be used to constrain or rule out such a scenario.

{}From deep optical images of three clusters selected by virtue of their
X-ray luminosity and/or optical richness (1455+22; $z=0.26$, 0016+16; $z=0.55$
and 1603+43; $z=0.89$), we construct statistically-complete samples of faint
field galaxies ($I \leq 25$) suitable for probing the effects of gravitational
lensing. By selecting clusters across a wide redshift range we separate the
effects of the mean redshift distribution of the faint field population well
beyond spectroscopic limits and the distribution of dark matter in the lensing
clusters. A significant lensing signature is seen in the two lower redshift
clusters whose X-ray properties are well-constrained. Based on these and
dynamical data, it is straightforward to rule out field redshift distributions
for $I \leq 25$ which have a significant low redshift excess compared to the no
evolution prediction, such as would be expected if the number counts at faint
limits were dominated by low-$z$ dwarf systems. The degree to which we can
constrain any high redshift tail to the no evolution redshift distribution
depends on the distribution of dark matter in the most distant lensing cluster.
In the second paper in this series, we use the lensing signal to reconstruct
the full two-dimensional mass distribution in the clusters and, together with
high resolution X-ray images, demonstrate that their structural properties are
well-understood. The principal result is therefore the absence of a dominant
low-$z$ dwarf population to $I \leq25$.

Using a non-parametric procedure developed by Kaiser \& Squires (1993), we
analyse the statistical image distortions of faint field galaxies to $I\ls25.5$
in two distant X-ray luminous clusters 1455+22 ($z_{cl}=0.26$) and 0016+16
($z_{cl}=0.55$) to derive two dimensional projected mass distributions for the
clusters. The mass maps of 1455+22 and 0016+16 are presented at effective
resolutions of 135 kpc and 200 kpc respectively (for $H_o$=50 kms sec$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, $q_o=0.5$) with a mean signal to noise per resolution element of 17
and 14. We compare our 2-D mass distributions on scales up to $\sim$1 Mpc with
those defined by the spatial distribution of colour-selected cluster members
and from deep high resolution X-ray images of the hot intracluster gas. Despite
the different cluster morphologies, one being cD-dominated and the other not,
in both cases the form of the mass distribution derived from the lensing signal
is strikingly similar to that traced by both the cluster galaxies and the hot
X-ray gas. We find some evidence for a greater central concentration of dark
matter with respect to the galaxies. The overall similarity between the
distribution of total mass and that defined by the baryonic components presents
a significant new observational constraint on the nature of dark matter and the
evolutionary history of rich clusters.

We present numerical simulations of galaxy formation, one of the most
challenging problems in computational astrophysics. The key point in such
simulations is the efficient solution of the N--body problem. If the gas of a
galaxy is treated by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the
hydrodynamic equations can be reduced to a form similar to that of the N--body
problem. A straightforward implementation requires a computational effort
$\propto N^2$, making it prohibitively expensive to simulate systems larger
than $10^5$ particles even on the largest available supercomputers. After a
description of the physical and numerical problems, we shortly review the
standard numerical methods to tackle these problems and discuss their
advantages and drawbacks. We also present a completely different approach to
perform such simulations using a workstation in combination with the special
purpose hardware {\sc Grape}. After a discussion of the main features of {\sc
Grape}, we present a simple implementation of a {\sc SPH}--N--body code on such
a configuration. Comparing results and performance of these two approaches, we
show, that with an investment of US \$ 50000, the problem can be solved up to 5
times faster than on a {\sc Cray} YMP.

Stationary, spherical accretion onto an unmagnetized neutron star is here
reconsidered on the wake of the seminal paper by Zel'dovich \& Shakura (1969).
It is found that new ``hot'' solutions may exist for a wide range of
luminosities. These solutions are characterized by a high temperature,
$10^{9}\div 10^{11}$ K, and arise from a stationary equilibrium model where the
dominant radiative mechanisms are multiple Compton scattering and
bremsstrahlung emission. For low luminosities, $\mincir 10^{-2} \ L_{E}$, only
the ``cold'' (\`a la Zel'dovich and Shakura) solution is present.

We present results of searching for the possible typical scales in the
spatial distribution of QSOs. Our method is based on the second derivative of
the two-point correlation function. This statistic is sensitive to the scale of
the maximum in the spectrum $P(k)$ of the density perturbation in the universe.
This maximum or bend scale can be detected as the wavelengths of the periodic
component in the second derivative of the integral correlation function. For
various QSO samples compiled from surveys of pencil-beam and bright QSOs, a
typical scale of about 93 $\pm$ 10 h$^{-1}$Mpc for $q_0=0.5$ has been detected.
This typical scale is in good agreement with that found in the spatial
distributions of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and CIV absorption systems of
QSOs if $q_0$ is taken to be $\sim 0.2$. Therefore, it is likely a common or
universal scale in the large scale structure traced by these objects. This
result is consistent with the assumption that the typical scale comes from a
characteristic scale in the spectrum of the density perturbation in the
universe.

Many analyses of microwave background experiments neglect the correlation of
noise in different frequency or polarization channels. We show that these
correlations, should they be present, can lead to severe misinterpretation of
an experiment. In particular, correlated noise arising from either electronics
or atmosphere may mimic a cosmic signal. We quantify how the likelihood
function for a given experiment varies with noise correlation, using both
simple analytic models and actual data. For a typical microwave background
anisotropy experiment, noise correlations at the level of 1\% of the overall
noise can seriously {\it reduce} the significance of a given detection.

High spectral and spatial resolution observations of the HCO+ molecule toward
the T Tau binary system obtained with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array reveal
a broad emission line profile (V_LSR = 7.2 km/s, width = 2.0 km/s) upon which a
narrow, redshifted absorption feature (V_LSR = 8.5 km/s, width +/- 0.5 km/s) is
superposed. One possible interpretation of the absorption is that it arises
from infall of molecular cloud envelope material onto the immediate
circumbinary region, which would imply that large scale dynamic accretion
processes are still active well into the optically visible stages of star
formation. Provided the mass is deposited at radii sufficiently close to the
young stars, estimates of the accretion rates indicate that infall may add
enough material to the system to account for the FU~Orionis type flares
recently observed in T~Tau in =< 100 yr.

We present the first results from an all-sky maser-line survey of symbiotic
Miras. Interferometric spectral-line observations of R Aqr and H1-36 Arae have
revealed a 22-GHz water maser in the former and 1612-MHz hydroxyl and weak
22-GHz water maser emission from the latter. H1-36 has thus become the first
known symbiotic OH/IR star. We have also detected weak OH line emission from
the vicinity of R Aqr, but we note that there are small discrepencies between
the OH- and H2O-line velocities and positions. These detections demonstrate
unequivocally that dust can shield some circumstellar hydroxyl and water
molecules from dissociation, even in systems which possess intense local
sources of UV. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of these
observations. The narrow profile of the water maser in R Aqr means that there
may finally be an opportunity to determine the system's orbital parameters. We
also point out that high resolution synthesis observations may trace the
distribution of dust in H1-36 and R Aqr, possibly throwing light on the
mass-loss process in symbiotic Miras and placing constraints on the amount of
collimation experienced by UV radiation from their hot, compact companions.

Recent maser surveys have shown that many potential OH/IR stars have no OH
masers in their circumstellar envelopes, despite the modest requirements which
should be implicitly met by IRAS colour-selected candidates. It has been
suggested that these OH/IR colour mimics must have a degenerate companion which
dissociates OH molecules and disrupts the masing action, ie. that they are
related to symbiotic Miras. Coincidentally, there is a paucity of long-period
symbiotic Miras and symbiotic OH/IR stars. Phenomonologically, those that are
known seem to cluster in the zone where field Miras transform into OH/IR stars.
If it could be proven that OH/IR colour mimics contain a degenerate star, that
observable evidence of this star is hidden from view by CS dust whilst it
slowly accretes from the wind of its Mira companion, then we have an excellent
explanation for not only the existence of OH/IR colour mimics, but also for the
low observed frequency of symbiotic OH/IR stars and the common occurrence of
very slow novae in long-period symbiotic Miras. Here, we employ radio continuum
radiation (which should escape unhindered from within the dust shells) as a
simple probe of the postulated hot degenerate companions which would inevitably
ionize a region of their surrounding gas. We compare the radio and infrared
properties of the colour mimics with those of normal symbiotic Miras, using the
strong correlation between radio and mid-IR emission in symbiotic stars. We
show that if a hot companion exists then, unlike their symbiotic counterparts,
they must produce radiation-bounded nebulae. Our observations provide no
support for the above scenario for the lack of observed masers, but neither do
they permit a rejection of this scenario.

I report on controlled comparison of gravitational approximation schemes
linear/lognormal/adhesion/frozen-flow/Zel'dovich(ZA) and ZA's second--order
generalization. In the last two cases we also created new versions of the
approximation by truncation, i.e., by finding an optimum smoothing window (see
text) for the initial conditions. The Zel'dovich approximation, with optimized
initial smoothing, worked extremely well. Its second-order generalization was
slightly better. The success of our best-choice was a result of the treatment
of the phases of nonlinear Fourier components. The adhesion approximation
produced the most accurate nonlinear power spectrum and density distribution,
but its phase errors suggest mass condensations were moved somewhat
incorrectly. Due to its better reproduction of the mass density distribution
function and power spectrum, adhesion might be preferred for some uses. We
recommend either n-body simulations or our modified versions of ZA, depending
on the purpose. Modified ZA can rapidly generate large numbers of realizations
of model universes with good accuracy down to galaxy group (or smaller) mass
scales.

Formation theories for central dominant galaxies in clusters require them to
be located at the minimum of the cluster gravitational potential. However, 32\%
(8 out of 25) of the clusters with more than 50 measured redshifts have central
galaxies with significant velocity offsets (with respect to other cluster
members). By studying their velocity distributions and correlations between
velocity and position, I show that the presence of a large peculiar velocity is
strongly correlated with the presence of substructure in these massive systems.
About 85\% (21 of 25) of all well-studied clusters show some evidence for
substructure, in contrast to the 30-40\% found when using only galaxy or gas
distributions. The correlation between substructure and central galaxy location
verifies the hypothesis of Merritt (1985) and Tremaine (1990) that high
peculiar velocities are indicative of recent merger events between less-massive
systems of galaxies. Dynamical friction should act quickly to pull the central
galaxy, the most massive discrete object in a cluster, to the minimum of the
potential. The less-massive galaxies retain information about their primordial
subclusters for a longer period of time. I use an objective partitioning
algorithm to assign cluster galaxies to their host subclumps. When galaxies are
allocated in this fashion to their subclusters, 75\% of the significant
velocity offsets are eliminated. Only 2 out of the 25 clusters have central
galaxies which are not centrally-located when substructure is considered in the
analysis.

We study the effect of the non-Gaussian clustering of galaxies on the
statistics of pencil beam surveys. We find that the higher order moments of the
galaxy distribution play an important role in the probability distribution for
the power spectrum peaks. Taking into account the observed values for the
kurtosis of galaxy distribution we derive the general probability distribution
for the power spectrum modes in non-Gaussian models and show that the
probability to obtain the 128$\hm$ periodicity found in pencil beam surveys is
raised by roughly one order of magnitude. The non-Gaussianity of the galaxy
distribution is however still insufficient to explain the reported
peak-to-noise ratio of the periodicity, so that extra power on large scales
seems required.

We present the results of a short time scale monitoring of SiO maser emission
(v=1 J=1-0 transition) in four known strong sources. These sources were
monitored nightly for a period of about a month. The aim of these observations
is to investigate the possible presence of variations in the maser lines on
time scales of a few days to weeks, due to sound waves propagating out from the
central star. If sound waves are responsible for the mass loss of certain cool
giants, as suggested by Pijpers and Hearn (1989) and Pijpers and Habing (1989),
local variations in density and relative velocity are expected just above the
stellar photosphere. These could give rise to variations in any narrow spectral
line formed in this region, and therefore in particular in the SiO maser lines.
Our observations indicate that variations in the line shape (leading to
relative changes in the intensity of about 20\%) occur in the SiO emission of
Mira type stars, within short time scales of 10-20 days. The main component of
the profile variability is consistent with a displacement of the velocity
centroid of the dominant maser peaks, by about 1 km s$^{-1}$ in the average.
Apparent variations in the total line flux were also found, but could be
partially due to calibration uncertainties.

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) discretization techniques are
generalized to develop a method, smoothed particle interpolation (SPI), for
solving initial value problems of systems of non-hydrodynamical nature. Under
this approach, SPH is viewed as strictly an interpolation scheme and, as such,
suitable for solving general hyperbolic and parabolic equations. The SPI method
is tested on (1) the wave equation with inhomogeneous sound speed and (2)
Burgers equation. The efficiency of SPI is studied by comparing SPI solutions
to those obtained with standard finite difference methods. It is shown that the
power of SPI arises when the smoothing particles are free to move.

We use new models of stellar population synthesis to estimate the fraction of
stars formed during the last major bursts of star formation in E/S0 galaxies in
low-redshift clusters ($z\simlt0.4$) from the spectral signatures of
intermediate-age stars. We find that the mass fraction of stars formed in late
bursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased smoothly with
redshift, from about 8\% at $z\approx1$ to less than 1\% at $z\approx0$. This
result, which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers, is
nearly independent of the assumed ages and morphological types of the
progenitor galaxies prior to the last major bursts of star formation. We then
compute the implied color and 4000 {\AA} break evolution for progenitors of
E/S0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts $0\simlt z\simlt1$. We investigate a
conservative model in which all present-day E/S0 galaxies are assumed to
initially be elliptical galaxies and to then undergo bursts of star formation
at the rate estimated from the signatures of intermediate-age stars at low
redshifts. This model reproduces well the observed spread of colors and 4000
{\AA} breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters, but underestimates the
fraction of galaxies in the blue tail of the distribution. Such a discrepancy
may be interpreted as an increasing fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at
high redshift, as suggested independently by recent {\it HST} observations of
intermediate-redshift clusters. The current data do not seem to require
morphological evolution of cluster galaxies out to $z\sim0.4$, but suggest that
either morphological or strong luminosity evolution might have played a major
role at $z\simgt0.7$.

We report the first use of the Rutgers Imaging Fabry-Perot Spectrophotometer
to study the dynamics of the cores of globular clusters. We have obtained
velocities for cluster stars by tuning the Fabry-Perot to take a series of
narrow-band images at different wavelengths across one of the Na D (5890 AA)
absorption lines. Measuring the flux in every frame yields a short portion of
the spectrum for each star simultaneously. This proves to be a very efficient
method for obtaining accurate stellar velocities; in crowded regions we are
able to measure hundreds of velocities in 3-4 hours of observing time. We have
measured velocities with uncertainties of less than 5 km/s for 216 stars within
1.5' of the center of the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078). The paper is a
uuencoded compressed postscript file.

We compare different nonlinear approximations to gravitational clustering in
the weakly nonlinear regime, using as a comparative statistic the evolution of
non-Gaussianity which can be characterised by a set of numbers $S_p$ describing
connected moments of the density field at the lowest order in $<\delta^2>$:
$<\delta^n>_c \simeq S_n<\delta^2>^{n-1}$. Generalizing earlier work by
Bernardeau (1992) we develop an ansatz to evaluate all $S_p$ in a given
approximation by means of a generating function which can be shown to satisfy
the equations of motion of a homogeneous spherical density enhancement in that
approximation. On the basis of the values of we show that approximations
formulated in Lagrangian space (such as the Zeldovich approximation and its
extensions) are considerably more accurate than those formulated in Eulerian
space such as the Frozen Flow and Linear Potential approximations. In
particular we find that the $n$th order Lagrangian perturbation approximation
correctly reproduces the first $n+1$ parameters $S_n$. We also evaluate the
density probability distribution function for the different approximations in
the quasi-linear regime and compare our results with an exact analytic
treatment in the case of the Zeldovich approximation.

We examine the collapse of an axion domain wall bounded by an axionic string.
It is found that the collapse proceeds quickly and axion domain walls
disappear. However axions are emitted in the collapse and its energy density
increases during radiation dominated era and contributes significantly to the
present mass density of the universe. In particular the axion emitted from the
wall can account for the dark matter in the universe for $F_a\gsim
10^{10}\GeV$.

We present optical spectra of QSO HS~1946+7658 with either high resolution
(FWHM=10 km/s) or high signal to noise ratio (SNR=40-100). We find 113 Lyman
alpha and six metal line systems. The metal systems at Zabs=2.844 and 3.050
have complex velocity structures. We find that the system at 2.844 is a damped
Ly-a absorption system, with neutral hydrogen column density of
logN(HI)=20.2+/-0.4, and it is the cause of the Lyman limit break at 3520\AA.
The metal abundance in the gas phase of the system is [M/H]=-2.6+/-0.3, with a
best estimate of [M/H]= -2.8, with ionization parameter Gamma=-2.75, from a
photoionization model. We show that the abundance ratios rule out appreciable
dust in this DLA system. We do not see the enhancement of O over C reported in
Nature by Reimers last years. We see CII*(1335) offset by 15 km/s with respect
to CII(1334), presumably because the gas density varies from 2 - 8 cm(-3) with
changing velocity in the DLA system. These densities imply that the damped
component is 6 - 25 pc thick, which is reasonable for a single cloud in a cold
spiral disk. We see a 2.6sigma lack of Ly-a forest lines well away from the QSO
redshift, which may be a chance fluctuation. We also see a correlation between
column density N(HI) and Doppler parameter b for 96 unsaturated Ly-a forest
absorption lines, and although this correlation persists in the 36 Ly-a lines
which lie in regions where SNR=8-16, we agree with Rauch etal (1993) that it is
probably a bogus effect of low SNR. We show that there are few low-b Ly-a
forest lines in moderate SNR data.

We derive the fully relativistic Ohm's law for an electron-positron plasma.
The absence of non-resistive terms in Ohm's law and the natural substitution of
the 4-velocity for the velocity flux in the relativistic bulk plasma equations
do not require the field gradient length scale to be much larger than the
lepton inertial lengths, or the existence of a frame in which the distribution
functions are isotropic.

We have made a detailed comparison of the results of large N-body simulations
with the analytical description of the merging histories of dark matter halos
presented in Lacey & Cole 1993, which is based on an extension of the Press-
Schechter method (Bond etal 1991,Bower 1991). We find the analytical
predictions for the halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to be
remarkably accurate. The analytical model is however expected to apply for
arbitrary Omega and general power spectra. Dark matter halos were identified in
the simulations using two different methods. For halos selected at mean
overdensities 100-200, the analytical mass function was found to provide a good
fit to the simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by the
spherical collapse model, with a typical error of <30% over a range of 1000 in
mass, which is the full dynamic range of our N-body simulations. This was
insensitive to the type of filtering used. Over a range of 100 - 1000 in mass,
there was also good agreement with the analytical predictions for merger rates,
including their dependence on the masses of the two halos involved and the time
interval being considered, and for formation times, including the dependence on
halo mass and formation epoch. The analytical Press-Schechter mass function and
its extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very useful
description of the growth of dark matter halos through hierarchical clustering,
and should providea valuable tool in studies of the formation and evolution of
galaxies and galaxy clusters.

An efficient algorithm for solving Poisson's equation in two and three
spatial dimensions is discussed. The algorithm, which is described in detail,
is based on the integral form of Poisson's equation and utilizes spherical
coordinates and an expansion into spherical harmonics. The solver can be
applied to and works well for all problems for which the use of spherical
coordinates is appropriate. We also briefly discuss the implementation of the
algorithm into hydrodynamic codes which are based on a conservative
finite--difference scheme.

I propose a method to fit the probability distribution function (hereafter
PDF) of the large scale density field rho, motivated by a Lagrangian version of
the continuity equation. It consists in applying the Edgeworth expansion to the
quantity Phi=log rho - < log rho >. The method is tested on the matter particle
distribution in two cold dark matter N-body simulations of different physical
sizes to cover a large dynamic range. It is seen to be very efficient, even in
the non-linear regime, and may thus be used as an analytical tool to study the
effect on the PDF of the transition between the weakly non-linear regime and
the highly non-linear regime.

Using observations of the 2496.7 A B I line with the HST GHRS at a nominal
resolution of 90,000, we have found the abundance of boron of HD 140283 to be
log epsilon_B (= 12 + log (N_B/N_H)) = 0.34 \pm 0.20. This result is found when
a significant non-LTE effect in the formation of the B I line is taken into
account. The resulting N_B/N_Be ratio is about 17 (in the range 9 -- 34), which
is in very good agreement with what is expected from spallation by cosmic rays.
We conclude that this origin of Be and B in the Early Galaxy is the most
probable of recently suggested formation mechanisms. (Submitted to A&A.

We examine the relationship between the group x-ray luminosity in the 0.3-3.5
keV band and the measured velocity dispersion, and galaxy surface number
density. We find definite correlations. Richer groups follow the same relation
as rich clusters (cf. Quintana & Melnick 1982) with $L_x \propto \sigma^{4.0\pm
0.6}$, but the relation flattens for lower luminosity systems which have
velocity dispersions below 300 km/s). We suggest that the $L_x-\sigma$ relation
arises from a combination of extended cluster emission and emission associated
with individual galaxies. The x-ray emission for the richer groups is dominated
by emission from the intra-group medium, as for the richer clusters; emission
from the poorer clusters is dominated by less extended emission associated with
the individual group galaxies. This is a corrected version of the paper which
appeared in the Astronomical Journal (February 1994). We include a new version
of the affected figure.

Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy may result from both scalar and
tensor perturbations. For a sufficiently narrow range of angular scales, CMB
perturbations can be characterized by four parameters. Results from the Cosmic
Background Explorer fix one combination of the parameters, reducing the
parameters to three. If CMB perturbations are from inflation, there is an
additional relation, reducing the parameters to two. An appropriate combination
of a medium-angle and a small-angle CMB observation can test the inflation
hypothesis because inflation cannot explain a high signal in one experiment and
a low signal in the other.

We use numerical simulations to calculate the cosmic microwave background
anisotropy induced by the evolution of a global texture field, with special
emphasis on individual textures. Both spherically symmetric and general
configurations are analysed, and in the latter case we consider field
configurations which exhibit unwinding events and also ones which do not. We
compare the results given by evolving the field numerically under both the
expanded core (XCORE) and non-linear sigma model (NLSM) approximations with the
analytic predictions of the NLSM exact solution for a spherically symmetric
self-similar (SSSS) unwinding. We find that the random unwinding configuration
spots' typical peak height is 60--75\% and angular size typically only 10\% of
those of the SSSS unwinding, and that random configurations without an
unwinding event nonetheless may generate indistinguishable hot and cold spots.
The influence of these results on analytic estimates of texture induced
microwave anisotropies is examined, and comparison made with other numerical
work.

Numerical simulations of the evolution of a global topological defect field
have two characteristic length scales --- one macrophysical, of order the field
correlation length, and the other microphysical, of order the field width. The
situation currently of most interest to particle cosmologists involves the
behaviour of a GUT-scale defect field at the epoch of decoupling, where the
ratio of these scales is typically of order $10^{50}$. Such a ratio is
unrealisable in numerical work, and we consider the approximations which may be
employed to deal with this. Focusing on the case of global texture we outline
the implementation of the associated algorithms, and in particular note the
subtleties involved in handling texture unwinding events. Comparing the results
in each approach then establishes that, subject to certain constraints on the
minimum grid resolution, the methods described are both robust and consistent
with one another.

Physics, St. Andrews, Scotland, August 1993.

We have obtained 12CO and 13CO J=1-0 observations of the nearby spiral galaxy
M33 to try to resolve the long-standing discrepancy between 12CO/13CO line
ratios measured in Galactic giant molecular clouds and external galaxies.
Interferometer maps of the molecular cloud MC20 give a 12CO/13CO line ratio of
7.5+/-2.1, which agrees reasonably well with the line ratio measured in
Galactic giant molecular clouds. In contrast, the 12CO/13CO line ratio obtained
from single dish data is 10.0+/-0.9, significantly higher than Galactic values
but in good agreement with line ratios measured in other galaxies. The
interferometer map of MC20 reveals that the cloud has similar spatial and
velocity extents in the two lines, and thus the high single dish line ratio
cannot be due to different filling factors in the two lines. In addition, the
single dish data show no evidence for significant variations in the line ratio
with metallicity, which eliminates abundance changes as the explanation for the
high single dish line ratio. We conclude that the high 12CO/13CO line ratio s
observed in M33, and in the disks of spiral galaxies in general, are due to the
presence of a population of diffuse molecular clouds. The lower limit to the
fraction of the total 12CO emission from M33 that originates in the diffuse
clouds is 30+/-30%, while the upper limit is ~60%.

It is shown that the violent relaxation of dissipationless stellar systems
leads to universal de Vaucouleurs profiles only outside 1.5 effective radii
$R_e$. Inside $1.5 R_e$ the surface density profiles depend strongly on the
initial conditions and are in general not in agreement with the de Vaucouleurs
law. This result is in contradiction to the observations which show that all
elliptical galaxies have de Vaucouleurs profiles inside $1.5 R_e$ and show
strong deviations outside $1.5 R_e$. The $r^{1/4}$-profiles of E-galaxies are
therefore not a direct result of collisionless violent relaxation and angular
momentum redistribution. It is rather a universal initial density profile which
is required in order to explain the universal structure of E-galaxies. A new
model for the formation of E-galaxies is presented which assumes that
ellipticals and bulges formed from isothermal, gaseous spheres which
accumulated in the core regions of dark matter halos and condensed into stars
through a cooling instability. This scenario predicts that early type galaxies
trace directly the core radii and core masses of their dark matter halos,
providing important information on the nature of the dark matter component in
galaxies.

We apply fractal analysis methods to investigate the scaling properties in
the Abell and ACO catalogs of rich galaxy clusters. We also discuss different
technical aspects of the method when applied to data sets with small number of
points as the cluster catalogs. Results are compared with simulations based on
the Zel'dovich approximation. We limit our analysis to scales less than 100
$\hm$. The cluster distribution show a scale invariant multifractal behavior in
a limited scale range. For the Abell catalog this range is 15--60$\hm$, while
for the ACO sample it extends to smaller scales. Despite this difference in the
extension of the scale--range where scale--invariant clustering takes place,
both samples are characterized by remarkably similar multifractal spectra in
the corresponding scaling regime. In particular, the correlation dimension
turns out to be $D_2\simeq 2.2$ for both Abell and ACO clusters. Although it is
difficult to point out the scale at which homogeneity is reached with the
present size of these redshift surveys, our results indicate that the cluster
distribution shows a tendency to homogeneity at large scales, disproving the
picture of a pure scale invariant fractal structure extending to arbitrarily
large distances.

Large-amplitude isothermal fluctuations in the dark matter energy density,
parameterized by $\Phi\equiv\delta\rhodm/\rhodm$, are studied within the
framework of a spherical collapse model. For $\Phi \ga 1$, a fluctuation
collapses in the radiation-dominated epoch and produces a dense dark-matter
object. The final density of the virialized object is found to be $\rho_F
\approx 140\, \Phi^3 (\Phi+1) \rhoeq$, where $\rhoeq$ is the matter density at
equal matter and radiation energy density. This expression is valid for the
entire range of possible values of $\Phi$, both for $\Phi \gg 1$ and $\Phi \ll
1$. Some astrophysical consequences of high-density dark-matter clumps are
discussed.

Using a set of $\pppm$ simulation which accurately treats the density
evolution of two components of dark matter, we study the evolution of clusters
in the Cold + Hot dark matter (CHDM) model. The mass function, the velocity
dispersion function and the temperature function of clusters are calculated for
four different epochs of $z\le 0.5$. We also use the simulation data to test
the Press-Schechter expression of the halo abundance as a function of the
velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$. The model predictions are in good agreement
with the observational data of local cluster abundances ($z=0$). We also
tentatively compare the model with the Gunn and his collaborators' observation
of rich clusters at $z\approx 0.8$ and with the x-ray luminous clusters at
$z\approx 0.5$ of the {\it Einstein} Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey. The
important feature of the model is the rapid formation of clusters in the near
past: the abundances of clusters of $\sigma_v\ge 700\kms$ and of $\sigma_v\ge
1200 \kms$ at $z=0.5$ are only 1/4 and 1/10 respectively of the present values
($z=0$). Ongoing ROSAT and AXAF surveys of distant clusters will provide
sensitive tests to the model. The abundance of clusters at $z\approx 0.5$ would
also be a good discriminator between the CHDM model and a low-density flat CDM
model both of which show very similar clustering properties at $z=0$.

It is shown that a significant amount of detectable gravitational
microlensing events that could potentially be found by MAssively Parallel
Photometry (MAPP) projects (such as the MACHO, EROS and OGLE collaborations)
will occur for stars too dim to be easily noticed individually by these
projects. This is the result of a large magnification bias effect, a bias of
including high magnification events in any flux-limited sample. The probability
of detecting these events may be as high as 2.3 times the lensing probability
of stars currently being monitored by MAPP collaborations.

Near--infrared, optical and ultraviolet quasi--simultaneous observations of
11 BL Lacertae objects are reported. For all but one source the dereddened
spectral flux distribution in the $8\cdot10^{13}-2\cdot10^{15}$ Hz frequency
range can be described by a single power law f$_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with
average spectral index $<\alpha>$ = 0.88 $\pm$ 0.42 (standard deviation) plus,
where relevant, the contribution of the host galaxy. In most cases the non
simultaneous soft X--ray fluxes obtained by the {\it Einstein Observatory} lie
on or below the extrapolation of the power law. The results are compared with
the average spectral properties of other samples of BL Lacs studied separately
in the IR--optical and in the UV bands. The implications for existing models of
the objects are shortly discussed.

There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like
oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for
convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these
oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must
be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements,
even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude.
  This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude
of oscillations (dL/L) can be derived from the velocity amplitude v_osc. Using
linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a
large sample of pulsating stars satisfy
  (dL/L)_bol proportional to v_osc/T_eff. Using this relationship, together
with the best estimate of v_osc(Sun) = (23.4 +/- 1.4) cm/s, we estimate the
luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550 nm to be dL/L = (4.7 +/- 0.3)
ppm.
  Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e.,
convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only
predictions come from model calculations by (Christensen-Dalsgaard & Frandsen,
Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough
to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although
convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties
of convection -- including oscillation amplitudes -- should change smoothly
through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity
amplitudes predicted by the model

The study by White (1984) on the growth of angular momentum in dark haloes is
extended towards a more detailed investigation of the spin parameter
$\lambda\equiv L\sqrt{E}/{G M^{2.5}}$. Starting from the Zel'dovich
approximation to structure formation, a dark halo is approximated by a
homogeneous ellipsoid with the inertial tensor of the (highly irregular)
Lagrangian region $\Upsilon$ from which the dark halo forms. Within this
approximation, an expression for the spin parameter can be derived, which
depends on the geometry of $\Upsilon$, the cosmological density parameter
$\Omega_0$, the overdensity of the dark halo, and the tidal torque exerted on
it. For Gaussian random fields, this expression can be evaluated statistically.
As a result, we derive a probability distribution of the spin parameter which
gives $\lambda\simeq0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, consistent with numerical
investigations. This probability distribution steeply rises with increasing
spin parameter, reaching its maximum at $\lambda\simeq0.025$. The 10 (50,90)
percentile values are $\lambda=0.02$ (0.05,0.11, respectively). There is a weak
anticorrelation of the spin parameter with the peak height $\nu$ of the density
fluctuation field $\lambda\propto \nu^{-0.29}$. The dependence on $\Omega_0$
and the variance $\sigma$ of the density-contrast field is very weak; there is
only a marginal tendency for the spin parameter to be slightly larger for
late-forming objects in an open universe. Due to the weak dependence on
$\sigma$, our results should be quite generally applicable and independent on

We present a detailed study of the growth of the Parker instability in a
differentially rotating disk embedded in an azimuthal equilibrium magnetic
field, such as the interstellar gas or an accretion disk. Basic properties of
the instability without shear are first recalled. Differential rotation is
modeled in the shearing sheet approximation, classical in the theory of spiral
density waves. The action of differential rotation is reduced to two different
effects, (i) a linear time-dependence of the radial wavenumber, and (ii) a
radial differential force. We present both exact numerical solutions, and
approximate analytical ones based on the WKB approximation in the limit of weak
differential rotation. Most important are (i) a transient natural stabilization
of the Parker mode due to the radial differential force (ii) the generation of
magnetosonic and Alfvenic waves, and (iii) in a certain parameter range a
possible ``turn-over'' of the perturbation whereby, quite surprisingly, matter
which had started being elevated by the instability may end up dropping towards
the disk midplane. A simplified model shows the possible observable effects of
this turn-over.

It has been shown that the large--scale correlation functions of the density
field (and velocity divergence field) follow a specific hierarchy in the
quasilinear regime and for Gaussian initial conditions (Bernardeau 1992). The
exact relationships between the cumulants of the probability distribution
functions (the so-called $S_p$ parameters) are however sensitive to the
smoothing window function applied to the fields. In this paper, I present a
method to derive the whole series of the $S_p$ parameters when the density
field is smoothed with a top--hat window function. The results are valid for
any power spectrum and any cosmological parameters. Similar calculations are
presented for the velocity divergence field.
  The resulting shapes of the one--point probability distribution functions of
the cosmic density and the velocity divergence fields are given as a function
of the power spectrum and $\Omega$. Simple analytical fits are proposed when
the index of the power spectrum is -1. Comparisons with numerical simulations
prove these analytical results to be extremely accurate.

The {\it COBE} DMR sky maps contain low-level correlated noise. We obtain
estimates of the amplitude and pattern of the correlated noise from three
techniques: angular averages of the covariance matrix, Monte Carlo simulations
of two-point correlation functions, and direct analysis of the DMR maps. The
results from the three methods are mutually consistent. The noise covariance
matrix of a DMR sky map is diagonal to an accuracy of better than 1\%. For a
given sky pixel, the dominant noise covariance occurs with the ring of pixels
at an angular separation of $60 \deg$ due to the $60 \deg$ separation of the
DMR horns. The mean covariance at $60 \deg$ is $0.45\% ^{+0.18}_{-0.14}$ of the
mean variance. Additionally, the variance in a given pixel is $0.7\%$ greater
than would be expected from a single beam experiment with the same noise
properties. Auto-correlation functions suffer from a $\sim 1.5\; \sigma$
positive bias at $60 \deg$ while cross-correlations have no bias. Published
{\it COBE} DMR results are not significantly affected by correlated noise. COBE

The optical depth to microlensing toward M31 due to known stars in the disk
of M31 itself is $\tau\sim 2\times 10^{-7}e^{-r/d}$ where $d$ is the disk scale
length and $r$ is the distance along the major axis. Thus, there can be
significant lensing toward the M31 disk even if M31 contains no dark compact
objects. The optical depth has a strong dependence on azimuthal angle: at fixed
radius $\tau\propto[1+ (h/d)\tan i\cos\phi]^{-2}$ where $h$ is the scale height
of the disk, $i=75^\circ$ is the inclination of M31, and $\phi$ is the
azimuthal angle relative to the near minor axis. By measuring the optical depth
as a function of radial and azimuthal position, it is possible to estimate $h$
and $d$ for the mass of the M31 disk, and so determine whether the disk light
traces disk mass. Ground-based observations in $0.\hskip-2pt''5$ seeing of 0.8
$\rm deg^2$ once per week could yield $\sim 3$ events per year. With an
ambitious space-based project, it would be possible to to observe $\sim 80$
events per year. If lensing events were dominated by the M31 spheroid rather
than the disk, the event rate would be higher and the spheroid's parameters
could be measured. The pattern of optical depths differs substantially for a
disk and a spheroid.

Fundamental assumptions which form the basis of models for large-scale
structure in the Universe are sketched in light of a Lagrangian description of
inhomogeneities. This description is introduced for Newtonian self-gravitating
flows. On its basis a Lagrangian perturbation approach is discussed and
compared with the standard Eulerian theory of gravitational instability. The
performance of Lagrangian perturbation solutions up to the third order is
demonstrated in comparison with numerical N-body simulations. First results of
this comparison are presented for large scales (PM-code) and for small scales
(tree-code).

This paper presents and analyses statistical results from a large number of
$N$-body simulations of isolated systems with equal masses, in which $250\le
N\le 2000$. It concentrates on the phase starting around the end of core
collapse, when binaries start to play a crucial role. Interactions of hard
binaries are consistent with the Spitzer (1987) cross section. The evolution of
the half-mass radius after core collapse nearly follows classical theory, The
evolution of the inner parts of the system around the time of core bounce is
consistent with these simplified models provided that the continuous production
of energy, as usually assumed, is replaced by a model of {\sl stochastic}
energy production. Similarly, post-collapse evolution of the core requires a
modest recalibration of the coefficient of energy generation, especially for
small $N$. The distributions of velocity dispersion and anisotropy become
remarkably homologous soon after core bounce. The bound mass of the systems
very nearly follows a power law with time. A small number of escapers, presumed
to be those associated with binary activity, dominate the energy which is
carried off. The ``internal" energy of escaping binaries is consistent with
theoretical expectations.

A general theoretical framework is developed for interpreting
spectropolarimetric observations of optically thin emission line scattering
from small dust particles. Spatially integrated and spatially resolved line
profiles of both scattered intensity and polarization are calculated
analytically from a variety of simple kinematic models. These calculations will
provide a foundation for further studies of emission line scattering from dust
and electrons in such diverse astrophysical environments as Herbig-Haro
objects, symbiotic stars, starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei.

Detailed comparisons are made between observations of scattered light
upstream of the head of the HH~1 jet and predictions of simple scattering
models. It is shown that, in order to unambiguously determine the velocity of
the head of the jet (bow shock) with respect to the upstream dust, existing
spectroscopic observations are insufficient and that spectropolarimetric
observations of the scattered light are necessary. Such an independent measure
of the bow shock velocity is important in order to test ``multiple outflow''
theories of Herbig-Haro jets. It is also shown 2that the scattering dust must
have a very forward-throwing scattering phase function
($\langle\cos\theta\rangle\msim 0.7$) and slight evidence is found for a
dust-gas ratio that is higher than average.

The Doppler shifts of optical emission lines which have been scattered by
surrounding dust and electrons can provide useful information about the
kinematics, geometry and physical conditions of astrophysical flows. In
principle, the scatterers can provide views of the line-emitting gas from
different directions, allowing the 3-d velocity field of the emitting gas to be
determined and revealing sources which are hidden from direct view.
Unfortunately, as in a Hall of Mirrors, the resultant multiple images can be
confusing and hard to interpret. In general, the scattering geometry will be
unknown, which makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of the motion of
the scatterers from that of the motion of the emitting source. In this
situation, spectropolarimetric observations can be a great help, since the
scattered light will be partially polarised to a degree dependent on the angle
of scattering and on the details of the scattering process. Analysis of the
polarisation profiles of the scattered emission lines can then determine the
relative orientation and velocity of the source and the scatterers. Such
techniques are applied to the upstream scattered emission lines in the HH 1
jet, where it is shown that spectropolarimetric measurements would allow an
independent determination of the bowshock velocity with respect to the upstream
matter, which would test ``multiple outburst'' models of the jet.

The properties of the probability distribution function of the cosmological
continuous density field are studied. We present further developments and
compare dynamically motivated methods to derive the PDF. One of them is based
on the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). We extend this method for arbitrary
initial conditions, regardless of whether they are Gaussian or not. The other
approach is based on perturbation theory with Gaussian initial fluctuations. We
include the smoothing effects in the PDFs. We examine the relationships between
the shapes of the PDFs and the moments. It is found that formally there are no
moments in the ZA, but a way to resolve this issue is proposed, based on the
regularization of integrals. A closed form for the generating function of the
moments in the ZA is also presented, including the smoothing effects. We
suggest the methods to build PDFs out of the whole series of the moments, or
out of a limited number of moments -- the Edgeworth expansion. The last
approach gives us an alternative method to evaluate the skewness and kurtosis
by measuring the PDF around its peak. We note a general connection between the
generating function of moments for small r.m.s $\sigma$ and the non-linear
evolution of the overdense spherical fluctuation in the dynamical models. All
these approaches have been applied in 1D case where the ZA is exact, and simple
analytical results are obtained. The 3D case is analyzed in the same manner and
we found a mutual agreement in the PDFs derived by different methods in the the
quasi-linear regime. Numerical CDM simulation was used to validate the accuracy
of considered approximations. We explain the successful log-normal fit of the
PDF from that simulation at moderate $\sigma$ as mere fortune, but not as a
universal form of density PDF in general.

We report on a recent paper (Wei\ss\ \& Buchert 1993), where we carry out
pencil beam constructions in a high-resolution simulation of the large-scale
structure of galaxies. As an example we present the results for the case of
``Hot-Dark-Matter" (HDM) initial conditions (with scale-free $n = 1$ power
index on large scales and $\Omega = 1$) as a representative of models with
sufficient large-scale power. We use an analytic approximation for particle
trajectories of a self-gravitating dust continuum and apply a local dynamical
biasing of volume elements to identify luminous matter in the model. Using this
method, we are able to resolve formally a simulation box of 1200h^-1 Mpc (e.g.
for HDM initial conditions) down to the scale of galactic halos using $2160^3$
particles. Pencil beam probes are taken for a given epoch using the parameters
of observed beams. In particular, our analysis concentrates on the detection of
a quasi-periodicity in the beam probes. The simulation is designed for
application to parameter studies which prepare future observational projects.
We find that a large percentage of the beams shows quasi-periodicities with
periods which cluster at a certain length scale. The periods found range
between one and eight times the cutoff length in the initial fluctuation
spectrum.

We present a thorough and detailed investigation of baryon isocurvature
models including realistic thermal histories, \ie, late or partial reionization
of the universe and compact object formation after standard recombination.
Constraints on these models are imposed from spectral distortion in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), number fluctuations in galaxy counts $\sigma_8$,
and recent CMB anisotropy observations. Since the status of degree scale
anisotropies is as yet unclear, the lack of spectral distortions is the most
serious constraint on the spectral index of initial fluctuations: $-1.2 \simlt
n \simlt -0.5$ in partially ionized models and $-1.2 \simlt n \simlt -0.9$ in
compact object dominated universes in order to avoid significant bias in galaxy
formation. Full ionization of the universe before $z = 300$ is also forbidden
by this constraint. Intermediate scale CMB fluctuations which are significantly
larger than standard CDM is a {\it robust} prediction of these models. Many
models are consequently in conflict with the recent degree scale detections by
Python, ARGO, and MSAM, \eg, compact object dominated models with $\Omega_0
\simlt 0.2$. Moreover, {\it all} models will be ruled out if the low CMB
fluctuations on degree scales as detected by the SP91 13 point scan are
confirmed. On the other hand, most models fare well compared with the high
Tenerife and MAX detections.

A Lagrangian relativistic approach to the non--linear dynamics of
cosmological perturbations of an irrotational collisionless fluid is
considered. Solutions are given at second order in perturbation theory for the
relevant fluid and geometric quantities and compared with the corresponding
ones in the Newtonian approximation. Specifically, we compute the density, the
volume expansion scalar, the shear, the ``electric" part, or tide, and the
``magnetic" part of the Weyl tensor. The evolution of the shear and the tide
beyond the linear regime strongly depends on the ratio of the characteristic
size of the perturbation to the cosmological horizon distance. For
perturbations on sub--horizon scales the usual Newtonian approximation applies,
at least at the considered perturbative order; on super--horizon scales,
instead, a new picture emerges, which we call ``silent universe", as each fluid
element evolves independently of the environment, being unable to exchange
signals with the surrounding matter through either sound waves or gravitational
radiation. For perturbations inside the Hubble radius particular attention is
paid in singling out non--local effects during the non--linear evolution of
fluid elements. These non--local effects are shown to be carried by a traceless
and divergenceless tensor, contained in the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor,
which is dynamically generated as soon as the system evolves away from the
linear regime.

We present the results of a search for X--ray luminous distant clusters of
galaxies. We found extended X--ray emission characteristic of a cluster towards
two of our candidate clusters of galaxies. They both have a luminosity in the
ROSAT bandpass of $\simeq10^{44}{\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}}$ and a redshift of $>0.5$;
thus making them two of the most distant X--ray clusters ever observed.
Furthermore, we show that both clusters are optically rich and have a known
radio source associated with them. We compare our result with other recent
searches for distant X--ray luminous clusters and present a lower limit of
$1.2\times10^{-7}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ for the number density of such high redshift
clusters. This limit is consistent with the expected abundance of such clusters
in a standard (b=2) Cold Dark Matter Universe. Finally, our clusters provide
important high redshift targets for further study into the origin and evolution
of massive clusters of galaxies. Accepted for publication in the 10th September
1994 issue of ApJ.

We consider the emission of high energy to very high energy $\gamma$-rays in
radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN) or the central regions of radio-loud
AGN. We use our results to estimate the $\gamma$-ray flux from the central
regions of nearby AGN, and then to calculate the contribution to the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray flux from unresolved AGN.

We discuss the non--linear growth of the kurtosis of the smoothed peculiar
velocity field (along an arbitrary direction), in an Einstein--de Sitter
universe, induced by Gaussian primordial density fluctuations. Applying the
perturbative theory, we show that, for different cosmological models, a
departure from the original Gaussian distribution is gravitationally induced
only on small scales ($\simlt 20-30$ Mpc). Models with scale--free power
spectrum $P(k)\propto k^{\,n}$, with $-1< n \leq 1$, are also considered. When
the fluid particles move according to the Zel'dovich approximation the
probability distribution of the peculiar velocity field remains unaltered
during the evolution.

Radio continuum emission has been detected from a planetary nebula in the
Large Magellanic Cloud: this is the first radio continuum detection for any
planetary nebula outside our galaxy. The radio flux density is a factor of two
lower than predicted from the \hbeta\ flux. This could be due either to a
two-component morphology or to a stellar contribution to the \hbeta\ emission.
We have modeled the optical and infrared spectrum using the photo-ionisation
code Cloudy: a very good fit is obtained if we assume the nebula is carbon
rich. The derived diameter implies an evolutionary age of the nebula of
$<1000\yr$, similar to what is derived from the IRAS colours alone. The central
star, which is of [WC] type, has a much higher stellar temperature than
Galactic [WC] stars showing similar circumstellar IRAS colours. An explanation
could be that the expansion velocity of the nebula is lower than those of its
galactic counterparts. This radio detection indicates that accurate nebular
luminosities could be determined from their radio emission for many LMC
planetary nebulae.

We describe a method for parameterizing two-integral distribution functions,
based on triangular tesselations of the integral plane. We apply the method to
the axisymmetric isotropic rotator model for the Galactic bulge of Kent~(1992),
and compare the results with observations of proper motions in Baade's Window,
and with radial velocity surveys. In spite of mounting evidence from surface
photometry and from study of the gas kinematics that the Galactic bulge is not
axisymmetric, the stellar kinematics in Baade's Window are very similar to
those of an isotropic oblate rotator. Another field at large radius does not
fit this model, though. In any case, the edge-on kinematics of a hot stellar
population are a poor handle on the existence or otherwise of a bar.

In this paper we show that the conventional diffusive shock acceleration
mechanism for cosmic rays associated with relativistic astrophysical shocks in
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has severe difficulties to explain the highest
energy cosmic ray events. We show that protons above around $2\times10^{20}\eV$
could have marginally been produced by this mechanism in an AGN or a rich
galaxy cluster not further away than around $100\Mpc$. However, for the highest
energy Fly's Eye and Yakutsk events this is inconsistent with the observed
arrival directions. Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields appear unable to
alter the direction of such energetic particles by more than a few degrees. We
also discuss some other options for these events associated with relativistic
particles including pulsar acceleration of high $Z$ nuclei. At the present
stage of knowledge the concept of topological defects left over from the early
universe as the source for such events appears to be a promising option. Such
sources are discussed and possible tests of this hypothesis are proposed.

We trace the evolution of cosmic microwave background photons propagating
through a reionized model universe. The reionization of the intergalactic
medium is achieved by UV photons emitted from the decaying `hot' dark matter
neutrinos. The model universe is represented by a comoving cube through which
we propagate photons and subject them to the Sachs-Wolfe effect and Thomson
scattering off the ionized fraction of the IGM, beginning at z=1900 until the
present z=0. The simulation follows the evolving matter inhomogeneities and
microwave background photons into the present nonlinear regime and yields
temperature maps of the microwave sky as a comoving observer would detect. Our
temperature maps display anisotropies on scales ranging from 2 to 8 degrees
with rms amplitudes ranging from DT/T_{rms} =2.8 to 3.4 times 10^{-5} without
reionization. If we allow the neutrinos to decay and subsequently reionize the
IGM, the level of the temperature anisotropies is reduced to DT/T=0.8 to 1.1
times 10^{-5}. This includes the Doppler shifts suffered by the CMB photons as
they scatter off the moving ionized fraction of the IGM. If, however,
reionization is caused by a late and sudden energy input into the IGM, we find
that some reduction in $\Delta T/T$ occurs, but not enough to make this
scenario consistent with observations. We find that the decaying neutrino
hypothesis is more efficient at reducing primordial anisotropies and generates
smaller Doppler anisotropies than a model reionized via a late and sudden
energy input into the IGM.

We show that HI clouds in the Magellanic Clouds are stripped by the
ram-pressure due to the halo and disk gases of the Galaxy. Molecular clouds are
swept to the edge of the LMC, showing an eccentric distribution. The stripped
HI clouds form a narrow band on the sky, and mimics the Magellanic Stream, when
the LMC takes a polar orbit. We point out that the Magellanic Stream will fall
into the Galaxy, and will be finally accreted by the Galactic disk. The
accretion may cause warping of the inner gas disk of the Galaxy. Some clouds
are accreted by the nuclear disk, which could explain the peculiar distribution
and kinematics in the central region. The stripping of the interstellar gas
from the Magellanic Clouds will rapidly change their morphological type into
dwarf ellipticals.

We investigate the clustering of galaxies in the QDOT redshift survey of IRAS
galaxies. We find that the redshift space two-point correlation function is
well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.11+\-0.09, with clustering length
3.87+\-0.32 Mpc/h out to pair separations of 25 Mpc\h. On scales larger than 40
Mpc/h, the correlation function is consistent with zero. The r.m.s. fluctuation
in the count of QDOT galaxies above the Poisson level in spheres of radius 8
Mpc/h is \sigma_8^{IRAS}=0.58+\-0.14, showing that fluctuations in the
distribution of IRAS galaxies on these scales are smaller than those of optical
galaxies by a factor of about 0.65, with an uncertainty of 25%. We find no
detectable difference between the correlation functions measured in redshift
space and in real space, leading to a $2\sigma$ limit of b_{IRAS}/\Omega^{0.6}
>1.05, where b_{IRAS} is the bias factor for IRAS galaxies and \Omega is the
cosmological density parameter. The QDOT autocorrelation function calculated in
concentric shells increases significantly with shell radius. This difference is
more likely due to sampling fluctuations than to an increase of the clustering
strength with galaxy luminosity, but the two effects are difficult to
disentangle; our data allow at most an increase of \sim 20% in clustering
strength for each decade in luminosity. For separations greater than \sim 3
Mpc/h, the cross-correlation function of Abell clusters (with Richness R\ge 1)
and QDOT galaxies is well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.81+\-0.10,
with clustering length 10.10+\-0.45 Mpc/h, and no significant signal beyond
\gsim 50 Mpc\h. This cross-correlation depends only weakly on cluster richness.

A large number of stellar evolution models with [Fe/H] = -2.3 and -3.3 have
been calculated in order to determine the primordial $^7$Li abundance and to
test current stellar evolution models by a comparison to the extensive database
of Li abundances in extremely metal poor halo stars observed by Thorburn
(1994). Standard models do a good job of fitting the observed Li abundances in
stars hotter than 5600 K. They predict a primordial $^7$Li abundance of Log
N(Li) = 2.24\pm 0.03$. Models which include microscopic diffusion predict a
downward curvature in the $^7$Li destruction isochrones at hot temperatures
which is not present in the observations. Thus, the observations clearly rule
out models which include uninhibited microscopic diffusion of $^7$Li from the
surface of the star. The [Fe/H] = -2.3 stellar models which include both
diffusion and rotational mixing provide an excellent match to the observations.
Both the plateau stars and the heavily depleted cool stars are well fit by
these models. The rotational mixing leads to considerable $^7$Li depletion in
these models and the primordial $^7$Li abundance inferred from these models is
Log N(Li) = $3.08\pm 0.1$.

We apply the adhesion approximation to study the formation and evolution of
voids in the Universe. Our simulations -- carried out using 128$^3$ particles
in a cubical box with side 128 Mpc -- indicate that the void spectrum evolves
with time and that the mean void size in the standard COBE-normalised Cold Dark
Matter (hereafter CDM) model with $h_{50} = 1,$ scales approximately as $\bar
D(z) = {\bar D_0\over \sqrt {1+z}},$ where $\bar D_0 \simeq 10.5$ Mpc.
Interestingly, we find a strong correlation between the sizes of voids and the
value of the primordial gravitational potential at void centers. This
observation could in principle, pave the way towards reconstructing the form of
the primordial potential from a knowledge of the observed void spectrum.
Studying the void spectrum at different cosmological epochs, for spectra with a
built in $k$-space cutoff we find that, the number of voids in a representative
volume evolves with time. The mean number of voids first increases until a
maximum value is reached (indicating that the formation of cellular structure
is complete), and then begins to decrease as clumps and filaments merge leading
to hierarchical clustering and the subsequent elimination of small voids. The
cosmological epoch characterizing the completion of cellular structure occurs
when the length scale going nonlinear approaches the mean distance between
peaks of the gravitational potential. A central result of this paper is that

We have searched for gravitational-lens induced echoes between gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) in NASA's orbiting {\it Compton} Gamma Ray Observatory's Burst
and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) data. The search was conducted in two
phases. In the first phase we compared all GRBs in a brightness complete sample
of the first 260 GRBs with recorded angular positions having at least 5 \%
chance of being coincident from their combined positional error. In the second
phase, we compared all GRB light curves of the first 611 GRBs with recorded
angular positions having at least 55 \% chance of being coincident from their
combined positional error. No unambiguous gravitational lens candidate pairs
were found in either phase, although a ``library of close calls" was
accumulated for future reference. This result neither excludes nor
significantly constrains a cosmological origin for GRBs.

In an attempt to understand the properties of convective energy transport in
the solar convection zone, a numerical model has been constructed for turbulent
flows in a compressible, radiation-coupled, non-magnetic, gravitationally
stratified medium using a realistic equation of state and realistic opacities.
The time-dependent, three-dimensional hydrodynamic equations are solved with
minimal simplifications.
  The statistical information obtained from the present simulation provides an
improved understanding of solar photospheric convection. The characteristics of
solar convection in shallow regions is parameterized and compared with the
results of Chan and Sofia's simulations of deep and efficient convection (Chan
and Sofia 1989). We assess the importance of the zones of partial ionization in
the simulation, and confirm that the radiative energy transfer is negligible
throughout the region except in the uppermost scale heights of the convection
zone, a region of very high super-adiabaticity.
  When the effects of partial ionization are included, the dynamics of flows
are altered significantly. However, we confirm the Chan and Sofia result that
kinetic energy flux is non-negligible and can have a negative value in the
convection zone.

Globular clusters cores harbour many low-mass X-ray binaries, cataclysmic
variables, and millisecond pulsar binaries which are likely to have been formed
via the process of tidal capture. Tidal capture binaries were originally
thought to be responsible for halting core collapse and for subsequent
re-expansion via the process of ``binary heating''. The standard model, now
suggests that these binaries are no longer viable as a direct energy source. We
present the results of a study which suggests that tidal capture binaries may
indeed be a significant direct source of energy for the cores of globular
clusters. We show that following capture, these binaries go through a short,
violent chaotic phase, with the orbital eccentricity (and hence the tidal
energy) suffering large changes on a very short timescale. This is followed by
a long quiescent phase in which the tidal energy remains small while the orbit
circularizes only via normal dissipative effects. This quiescent phase allows
captured main sequence stars to evolve in the absence of large tides, a fact
important for the production of low-mass X-ray binaries and cataclysmic
variables.

HQM is an optical broad-band photometric monitoring program carried out since
Sept.~1988. Our main intention is to search for indications of microlensing in
a sample of $\sim$\,100 selected quasars; however, we also want to study the
intrinsic variability. We use a CCD camera equipped to the MPIA 1.2$\,$m
telescope. Fully automatic photometric reduction relative to stars in the frame
is done within a few minutes after each exposure, thus interesting brightness
changes can be followed in detail. The typical photometric error is 1--2\,\%
for a 17.5\,mag quasar, making HQM the most accurate long-term quasar
monitoring program yet carried out. The main results of HQM which we discuss
here are: (1) Concerning variability, quasars form two, clearly distinct
classes, optically violent variables (OVVs) and non-OVVs. (2) All OVVs are
radio loud and probably belong to the blazar class. (3) Non-OVVs have
lightcurve gradients of at most several 0.1\,mag\,yr$^{-1}$ in the quasar
restframe and can be well fitted by polynomials of low order. (4) Although our
data cover only a relatively short timespan, we conclude that there is a large
fraction of quasars which would be undetectable in photographic surveys using
optical variability alone as the selection criterium. (5) A broad class of
flat-spectrum radio quasars are no blazars, they are even less variable in the
optical than radio quiet objects. (6) There is some statistical evidence for
microlensing in our sample; if present it does, however, lead only to low
lightcurve gradients.

We also discuss existing literature data.

4C\,56.27 (1823+568), this paper is the first variability study. We have also
carried out POSS photometry to obtain indications for variability on a longer
timescale.

Walraven photometry of established and probable members of the Orion OB1
association is presented. Effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity
and mass are derived for all stars, using atmosphere models by Kurucz (1979).
Absolute magnitudes are calculated using the Straizys and Kuriliene (1981)
tables. Distance moduli and visual extinctions are determined. A comparison of
the visual extinctions to IRAS $100\um$ data shows that the near edge of the
Orion A and B clouds lies at a distance of $\sim 320\pc$, while the far edge is
at $\sim 500\pc$. A method for deriving the ages of the subgroups by comparing
theoretical isochrones to the observations in the log g, log T plane is
presented. The derived ages suggest, contrary to earlier studies, that subgroup
1b is younger than 1c, which can possibly be explained by past geometries of
the system of stars and gas. The initial mass function for Orion OB1 is derived
with the aid of the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. Through extensive simulations, we
show that it is very difficult to derive accurately the IMF from the available
data. To within somewhat weak limits the IMF is found to be of the form $\xi
(\log M)=AM^{-1.7\pm 0.2}$ for all subgroups. The energy output of the
subgroups in the form of stellar winds and supernovae is calculated and
compared to the observed size and expansion velocity of the Orion-Eridanus
bubble. It is shown that the energy output of the association can account for
the morphology and kinematics of the ISM.

We consider viscous rotating accretion flows in which most of the viscously
dissipated energy is stored as entropy rather than being radiated. Such
advection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small
or very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the
temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is
quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular
velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long
before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is
positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing
outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will
tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated
accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars
and the widespread occurrence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.

We announce the detection of correlations on angular scales of $\ga10'$
between optically bright, high-redshift, radio-loud QSOs with diffuse X-ray
emission seen by ROSAT in the {\it All-Sky Survey}. These correlations reach
significance levels of up to $99.8\%$. A comparison of the results with a
sample of control fields, bootstrapping analyses, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
provide unambiguous support for the statistical significance of the
correlations found. We argue that the detected enhanced diffuse X-ray emission
is in the foreground of the QSOs, and that it is probably due to galaxy
clusters which magnify the QSOs by their gravitational lensing effect, thereby
giving rise to a magnification bias in the background source sample. A
comparison of the results presented below with correlations previously found
between the same QSO sample and either Lick or IRAS galaxies provides further
evidence for this interpretation, and identifies positions in the sky where
weak gravitational lensing may be detected by searching for coherent
distortions of background galaxy images.

We reformulate the transport equation which determines the size, shape and
orientation of infinitesimal light beams in arbitrary spacetimes. The behaviour
of such light beams near vertices and conjugate points is investigated, with
special attention to the singular behaviour of the optical scalars. We then
specialize the general transport equation to the case of an approximate metric
of an inhomogeneous universe, which is a Friedmann metric `on average' with
superposed isolated weak matter inhomogeneities. In a series of well-defined
approximations, the equations of gravitational lens theory are derived.
Finally, we derive a relative optical focusing equation which describes the
focusing of light beams relative to the case that the beam is unaffected by
matter inhomogeneities in the universe, from which it follows immediately that
no beam can be focused less than one which is unaffected by matter clumps,
before it propagates through its first conjugate point.

We describe an algorithm for long-term planetary orbit integrations,
including the dominant post-Newtonian effects, that employs individual
timesteps for each planet. The algorithm is symplectic and exhibits short-term
errors that are $O(\epsilon\Omega^2\tau^2)$ where $\tau$ is the timestep,
$\Omega$ is a typical orbital frequency, and $\epsilon\ll1$ is a typical
planetary mass in solar units. By a special starting procedure long-term errors
over an integration interval $T$ can be reduced to
$O(\epsilon^2\Omega^3\tau^2T)$. A sample 0.8 Myr integration of the nine
planets illustrates that Pluto can have a timestep more than 100 times
Mercury's, without dominating the positional error. Our algorithm is applicable
to other $N$-body systems.

Results are presented for one-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics
computations of the structure and evolution of Lya forest clouds
gravitationally confined by dark matter minihalos. The clouds are developed
from linear perturbations at high redshift and exposed to either a QSO- or
galaxy-dominated metagalactic radiation field at moderate redshifts. While the
emphasis is on spherical systems, slab symmetry is also considered. Three zones
may be identified in a collapsed cloud: (1) a quasi-hydrostatic core in thermal
equilibrium, (2) a nonhydrostatic intermediate zone out of thermal equilibrium,
and (3) a cosmological accretion layer joining onto the Hubble expansion. Most
of the measured Lya forest column densities arise in the intermediate zone. The
development of the core would result in a flattening in the column density
distribution near an HI column density of 10**15-10**16 cm**-2. The cloud
diameters corresponding to an HI column density of 10**14 cm**-2 lie in the
range 10-60 kpc, while systems with column densities exceeding 10**15 cm**-2
have diameters smaller than 10 kpc. Systems with circular velocities exceeding
50 km/s result in clouds which contract until they become Jeans unstable and
collapse. The critical column density for collapse is 10**17-10**18 cm**-2. A
mild correlation of Doppler parameter with neutral hydrogen column density is
found in several models for systems with column densities less than 10**13.5
cm**-2, with Doppler parameters occurring as low as b > 20 km/s for 10**13
cm**-2 column density systems. No lines with b < 15 km/s are found.

A sensitive search for 6.7--GHz methanol maser emission has been made towards
10 galaxies that have yielded detectable microwave molecular--line transitions.
These include several which show OH megamaser or superluminous \water\/ maser
emission. Within the Galaxy, \methanol\/ and OH masers often occur in the same
star formation regions and, in most cases, the \methanol\/ masers have a
greater peak flux density than their OH counterparts. Thus we might expect
\methanol\/ masers to be associated with extragalactic OH maser sources. We
failed to detect any emission or absorption above our 60--mJy detection limit.
We conclude that if the physical conditions exist to produce \methanol\/
megamaser emission, they are incompatible with the conditions which produce OH
megamaser emission.

Recently the Polish-American collaboration OGLE has reported the observation
of four possible microlensing events by monitoring, over several months, the
brightness of millions of stars in the region of the galactic bulge. If these
events are due to microlensing, the most accurate way to get information on the
mass of the dark compact objects, that acted as gravitational lenses, is to use
the method of the mass moments. Here I apply this method to the analysis of the
events detected by OGLE. The average mass turns out to be 0.28$M_{\odot}$,
suggesting that the lens objects are faint disk stars. The same method applied
to the five microlensing events detected so far by the EROS and MACHO
collaborations, which monitor stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, leads to an
average value of 0.08$M_{\odot}$ for the dark compact halo objects.

Gravitino production and decay in the inflationary universe are reexanimed.
Assuming that gravitino mainly decays into photon and photino, we have
calculated the upperbound of the reheating temperature. Compared to previous
works, we have essentially improved the following two points; (i) the helicity
$\pm\frac{3}{2}$ gravitino production cross sections are calculated by using
the full relevant terms in the supergravity lagrangian, and (ii) high energy
photon spectrum is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations numerically.
Photo-dissociation of the light elements (D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He) leads to the
most stringent upperbound of the reheating temperature, which is given by
($10^{6}$--$10^{9}$)GeV for the gravitino mass 100GeV--1TeV. On the other hand,
requiring that the present mass density of photino should be smaller than the
critical density, we find that the reheating temperature have to be smaller
than ($10^{11}$--$10^{12}$)GeV for the photino mass (10--100)GeV,
irrespectively of the gravitino mass. The effect of other decay channel is also
considered.

We report on new radio measurements of Galactic planetary nebulae, aimed at
resolving the controversies on the reliability of older VLA flux densities and
the suggested deviations from the standard Galactic extinction law found for
planetary nebulae. We show that for faint ($<$10 mJy) objects observed at high
angular resolution, previous determinations are indeed too low. For the bright
objects we find no significant differences. The new values are the most
accurate flux determinations yet for planetary nebulae, reaching 1\% for the
brightest objects in the sample. Based on the new data, we confirm that there
is a systematic difference between the extinction derived from the
radio/H$\beta$ flux ratio and derived from the Balmer decrement, which led to
the suggestion of deviations from the standard extinction law. However, final
confirmation of this has to await the availibility of more, accurate
measurements of the Balmer (and/or Paschen) lines.

In a recent paper Loveday et al. (1992) have presented new results on the
luminosity function for a sample of galaxies with $b_J \le 17.15$. After having
morphologically classified each galaxy (early--type, late--type, merged or
uncertain), they have estimated the parameters of a Schechter luminosity
function for early-- and late--type galaxies. However, in their sample there is
a bias against identifying early--type galaxies at large distances and/or faint
magnitudes: in fact, many of the early--type galaxies at faint magnitudes have
probably been classified as ``uncertain". As discussed in Loveday et al., the
existence of such a bias is indicated by the fact that for these galaxies
$<V/V_{max}>=0.32$. In this paper we show, both theoretically and through the
use of simulated samples, that this incompleteness strongly biases the derived
parameters of the luminosity function for early--type galaxies. If no
correction for such incompleteness is applied to the data (as done by Loveday
et al.), one obtains a flatter slope $\alpha$ and a brighter $M^*$ with respect
to the real parameters.

The ages of globular clusters inferred from observations depends sensitively
on assumptions like the initial helium abundance and the mass loss rate. A high
helium abundance (e.g., $Y\approx$0.28) or a mass loss rate of
$\sim$10$^{-11}M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ near the main sequence turn-off region lowers
the current age estimate from 14 Gyr to about 10--12 Gyr, significantly
relaxing the constraints on the Hubble constant, allowing values as high as
60km/sec/Mpc for a universe with the critical density and 90km/sec/Mpc for a
baryon-only universe. Possible mechanisms for the helium enhancement in
globular clusters are discussed, as are arguments for an instability strip
induced mass loss near the turn-off. Ages lower than 10 Gyr are not possible
even with the operation of both of these mechanisms unless the initial helium
abundance in globular clusters is $>0.30$, which would conflict with indirect
measurements of helium abundances in globular clusters.

We analyze the cosmic peculiar velocity field as traced by a sample of 1184
spiral, elliptical and S0 galaxies, grouped in 704 objects. We perform a
statistical analysis, by calculating the bulk flow, Cosmic Mach Number and
velocity correlation function for this sample and for mock catalogs extracted
from a set of N--body simulations. We run four cold dark matter (CDM)
simulations: two tilted models (with spectral index $n=0.6$ and $n=0.8$), the
standard model ($n=1$) and a ``blue" one ($n=1.2$), with different values of
the linear bias parameter $b$. By means of a Maximum Likelihood analysis we
estimate the ability of our models to fit the observations, as measured by the
above statistics, and to reproduce the Local Group properties. On the basis of
this analysis we conclude that the best model is the unbiased standard model
$(n,~b)=(1,~1)$, even though the overall flatness of the joint likelihood
function implies that one cannot strongly discriminate models in the range $0.8
\le n \le 1$, and $1 \le b \le 1.5$. Models with $b \geq 2.5$ are rejected at
the $95\%$ confidence level. For $n=0.8$ the values of $b$ preferred by the
present analysis, together with the {\em COBE} data, require a negligible
contribution to $\Delta T/T$ by gravitational waves. Finally, the blue model,
normalized to {\em COBE}, does not provide a good fit to the velocity data.

The natural approach to a spectral analysis of data distributed on the sky
employs spherical harmonic decomposition. A common problem encountered in
practical astronomy is the lack of full sky coverage in the available data. For
example, the removal of the galactic plane data from the COBE DMR sky maps
compromises Fourier analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature distribution due to the loss of orthogonality of the spherical
harmonics. An explicit method for constructing orthonormal functions on an
incomplete (e.g. Galaxy-cut) sphere is presented. These functions should be
used in the proper Fourier analysis of the COBE DMR sky maps to provide the
correct input for the determination of the spectrum of primordial
inhomogeneity. The results of such an analysis are presented in an accompanying
Letter. A similar algebraic construction of appropriate functions can be
devised for other astronomical applications.

A new technique of Fourier analysis on a cut sky (Gorski, 1994) has been
applied to the two year COBE DMR sky maps. The Bayesian power spectrum
estimation results are consistent with the Harrison-Zel'dovich n=1 model. The
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the power spectrum of
primordial perturbations are n=1.22 (1.02) and Q_{rms-PS}=17 (20) uK including
(excluding) the quadrupole anisotropy. The marginal likelihood function on n
renders n=1.10 \pm 0.32 (0.87 \pm 0.36).

MAPPIT is an optical interferometer installed at the coude focus of the 3.9-m
Anglo-Australian Telescope. The instrument combines non-redundant masking with
wavelength dispersion and is able to record fringes simultaneously over a wide
bandwidth. For typical observations centred near 600 nm, the bandwidth is 55 nm
and the spectral resolution is 3 nm. This paper describes the instrument and
the data processing methods and presents some results. We find the star sigma
Sgr to be a close binary; the system is only partially resolved, with a
separation of (11.5 +/- 2) milliarcsec (assuming the components to have equal
magnitudes). We also give angular diameter measurements of two red giant stars,
alpha Sco and beta Gru. The observations of beta Gru (spectral type M5 III)
resolve the star for the first time and give an equivalent uniform-disk
diameter of (27 +/- 3) milliarcsec.

The claim by Dar and Shaviv that they have found a standard model solution to
the solar neutrino problem is based upon an incorrect assumption made in
extrapolating nuclear cross sections and the selective use of a small fraction
of the nuclear physics and of the neutrino data. In addition, five different
solar model codes show that the rate obtained for the chlorine experiment using
the Dar-Shaviv stated parameters differs by at least $14 \sigma$ from the
observed rate.

When a galaxy forms, the disk may initially be tilted with respect to a
flattened dark halo. The misalignment between the disk and the halo is a common
explanation for galactic disk warps, since in this state, disks have precessing
bending modes which resemble real warps. A dubious assumption in this theory is
that the gravitational response of the halo is negligible. We therefore
calculate the response of an oblate halo to a precessing inclined exponential
disk using a variety of techniques. We construct models with a rigid
exponential disk precessing in a particle halo, a particle disk precessing
inside a static bulge/halo potential, and a self-consistent model with a
particle disk, bulge and halo. When the disk:halo mass ratio is small
($\sim$10\%) within 5 exponential scale radii, the disk settles to the
equatorial plane of the halo within 5 orbital times. When the disk and halo
mass are comparable, the halo rapidly aligns with the disk within a few orbital
times, while the disk inclination drops. The rapid response of the halo to a
inclined disk suggests that the warps seen in galactic disks are not likely the
bending modes of a precessing disk inside of triaxial halos. If a galaxy forms
inclined to the principal plane of a dark halo, either the disk will settle to
a principal plane or the inner halo will twist to align with the disk. The
outer halo will remain misaligned for a much longer time and therefore may
still exert a torque. Warped bending modes may still exist if the misalignment
of the outer halo persists for a Hubble time.

The contribution to the local cosmic-ray flux from the Geminga supernova is
calculated assuming shock acceleration to 10^14 eV in a remnant which was
formed several 10^5 years ago along with the Geminga pulsar. The particles are
propagated to Earth using a simple diffusion model. In the region below the
knee in the spectrum, it is found the supernova may contribute 10% of the local
cosmic-ray flux, assuming plausible explosion parameters. The contribution to
the amplitude of the anisotropy is not in conflict with the data in this energy
region.

Hierarchical gravitational clustering creates galaxies that usually do not
fully share the dynamical history of an average particle in the mass field. In
particular, galaxy tracers identified in numerical simulations can have
individual velocity dispersions in virialized regions a factor \bvs\ lower than
the dark matter. The field average of the pairwise velocity dispersion depends
on the statistical weighting of collapsed regions, so that the tracer pairwise
dispersion is a different factor, \bvp, times the density field value. A model
of a cool equilibrium tracer population demonstrates that mass to light
segregation is very sensitive to single particle velocity bias. For the
$\phi=-GM/(r+a)$ potential a $\bvs=0.9$ tracer indicates a virial mass about a
factor of 5 low. The likely value of \bvs\ is estimated and the simple
equilibrium model is tested for applicability using a $10^6$ particle
simulation of the formation of a single cluster from cosmological initial
conditions. From this simulation, the value of \bvs\ is estimated as
$0.8\pm0.1$. The pairwise velocity dispersion bias, \bvp, which is equal to
\bvs\ augmented with any anti-bias of galaxies against high velocity dispersion
clusters. The value of \bvp\ is estimated to be 15\% less than \bvs,
consequently $\bvp=0.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$. Comparison of cluster mass and
luminosity profiles at large radii is a test for the existence of single
particle velocity bias. [compressed postscript file cluster.ps.Z via anonymous

Without assuming any solar models and neutrino flavor conversions, $^8$B
neutrinos seen by the Kamiokande experiment should contribute 2.6$\pm 0.45$ SNU
to the chlorine experiment. When this rate is compared with the total event
rate of 2.3$\pm 0.2$ SNU observed by the Homestake experiment which should
inlude a 0.2 SNU contribution from uncertainty-free pep neutrinos, there may
still be a possible evidence that $^7$Be neutrinos are more severely suppressed
than the $^8$B neutrinos with respect to the predictions of standard solar
models, which cannot be explained by any known astrophysics solution. Given a
Kamiokande event rate of larger than 36$\%$ (2$\sigma$) of the prediciton of
Bahcall and Pinsonneault's standard solar model, variations of standard solar
models yield minimal rates of 3.6 SNU for the Homestake experiment and 114 SNU
for GALLEX and SAGE. Therefore, variations of standard solar models as
solutions to the solar neutrino problem are so far inconsistent with the
Homestake experiment and only marginally allowed by the gallium experiments. If
the gallium experiments confirm a flux significantly below 114 SNU, it would
imply unconventional physics.

We derive an optimal linear filter to suppress the noise from the COBE DMR
sky maps for a given power spectrum. We then apply the filter to the first-year
DMR data, after removing pixels within $20^\circ$ of the Galactic plane from
the data. The filtered data have uncertainties 12 times smaller than the noise
level of the raw data. We use the formalism of constrained realizations of
Gaussian random fields to assess the uncertainty in the filtered sky maps. In
addition to improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the map as a whole, these
techniques allow us to recover some information about the CMB anisotropy in the
missing Galactic plane region. From these maps we are able to determine which
hot and cold spots in the data are statistically significant, and which may
have been produced by noise. In addition, the filtered maps can be used for
comparison with other experiments on similar angular scales.

In many cosmological models, the large angular scale anisotropy in the cosmic
microwave background is parameterized by a spectral index, $n$, and a
quadrupolar amplitude, $Q$. For a Peebles-Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum, $n=1$.
Using data from the Far Infra-Red Survey (FIRS) and a new statistical measure,
a contour plot of the likelihood for cosmological models for which $-1 < n < 3$
and $0 \le Q \le 50~\mu{\rm K}$ is obtained. We find that the likelihood is
maximum at $(n, Q) = (1.0, 19 uK)$. For constant $n$ the likelihood falls to
half its maximum at $Q \approx 14 uK$ and $25 uK$ and for constant $Q$ the
likelihood falls to half its maximum at $n \approx 0.5$ and $1.4$. Regardless
of $Q$, the likelihood is always less than half its maximum for $n < -0.4$ and
for $n > 2.2$, as it is for $Q < 8 uK$ and $Q > 44$.

We show that the spatial correlation function of a flux-limited sample of
X-ray selected clusters of galaxies will exhibit a correlation scale that is
smaller than the correlation scale of a volume-limited, richness-limited sample
of comparable apparent spatial density. The flux-limited sample contains
clusters of different richnesses at different distances: poor groups are found
nearby and rich clusters at greater distances. Since the cluster correlation
strength is known to increase with richness, the flux-limited sample averages
over the correlations of poor and rich clusters. On the other hand, a
volume-limited, richness-limited sample has a minimum richness threshold, and a
constant mixture of richnesses with redshift. Using the observed correlation
scale for rich ($R\ge 1$) clusters, $r_o (R\ge 1) = 21\pm 2 h^{-1}$Mpc that was
determined from previous volume-limited studies, we derive for the ROSAT
flux-limited X-ray cluster sample $r_o({\rm flux}{\rm -}{\rm limited}) \approx
14h^{-1}$Mpc, in agreement with the recently observed value of $13.7\pm 2.3
h^{-1}$Mpc.

We compute the evolution of spatially flat, mixed cold and hot dark matter
(``MDM") models containing both baryonic matter and two kinds of dark matter.
The mean final Zeldovich-Sunyaev $y$ parameter is estimated to be $\bar
y=(5.4\pm 2.7)\times 10^{-7}$, with a rms fluctuation of approximately
$\bar{\delta y}=(6.0\pm 3.0)\times 10^{-7}$ on arc minute scales. The rate of
galaxy formation peaks at an even later epoch ($z\sim 0.3$) than in the
standard ($\Omega=1$, $\sigma_8=0.67$) CDM model ($z\sim 0.5$) and, at a
redshift of z=4 is nearly a factor of a hundred lower than for the CDM model
with the same value of $\sigma_8$. The model yields a cluster mass function
which is about a factor of 4 higher than observed but a cluster-cluster
correlation length lower by a factor of 2 than what is observed but both are
closer to observations than in the COBE normalized CDM model. The one
dimensional pairwise velocity dispersion is $605\pm 8$km/s at $1h^{-1}$
separation, lower than that of the CDM model normalized to COBE, but still
significantly higher than observations (Davis \& Peebles 1983). A plausible
velocity bias $b_v=0.8\pm 0.1$ on this scale will reduce but not remove the
discrepancy. Overall, the model is similar both on large and intermediate
scales to the standard CDM model normalized to the same value of $\sigma_8$,
but the problem with regard to late formation of galaxies is more severe in
this model than in that CDM model. Adding hot dark matter significantly
improves the ability of COBE normalized CDM scenario to fit existing
observations, but the model is in fact not as good as the CDM model with the
same $\sigma_8$ and is still probably unsatisfactory with regard to several
critical tests.

A new, three-dimensional, shock capturing, TVD hydrodynamic code is utilized
to determine the distribution of hot gas in a CDM$+\Lambda$ model universe.
This open model succeeds in matching local observations of clusters in contrast
to the standard $\Omega=1$, CDM model, which fails. It predicts an order of
magnitude decline in the number density of bright ($h\nu = 2-10$keV) clusters
from $z=0$ to $z=2$ in contrast to a slight increase in the number density for
standard $\Omega=1$, CDM model. This COBE-normalized CDM$+\Lambda$ model
produces approximately the same number of X-ray clusters having
$L_x>10^{43}$erg/s as observed. The number density of bright clusters increases
to $z\sim 0.2-0.5$ and declines, but the luminosity per typical cluster
decreases monotonically with redshift, with the result that the number density
of bright clusters shows a broad peak near $z=0.5$, and then a rapid decline as
$z\rightarrow 3$. The most interesting point which we find is that the
temperatures of clusters in this model freeze out at later times ($z\le 0.3$),
while previously we found in the CDM model that there was a steep increase
during the same interval of redshift. The trend should be detectable even with
a relatively ``soft" X-ray instrument such as ROSAT, providing a powerful
discriminant between $\Omega=1$ and $\Omega<1$ models. Examining the ratio of
gas-to-total mass in the clusters, we find a slight antibias ($b=0.9$ or
$({\Omega_{gas}\over\Omega_{tot}})_{cl} =0.083\pm 0.007$), which is consistent
with observations [$({\Omega_{gas}\over\Omega_{tot}})_{obs}=0.097\pm 0.019$ for
the Coma cluster for the given value of $h$, \cf, White 1991].

We exmaine the distribution of hot gas in a standard CDM model of the
universe using high resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Adopting standard
parameters determined from COBE and light element nucleosynthesis,
$\sigma_8=1.05$, $\Omega_b=0.06$ and assuming $h=0.5$, we find the X-ray
emitting clusters, compute the luminosity function at several wavelengths, the
temperature distribution and estimated sizes as well as the evolution of these
quantities with redshift. This standard CDM model, normalized to COBE, produces
approximately 5 times too much emission from clusters having
$L_x>10^{43}$erg/s, a not unexpected result. If all other parameters were
unchanged, we would expect adequate agreement for $\sigma_8=0.6$. This provides
a new and independent argument for lower small scale power than standard CDM at
the $8h^{-1}$Mpc scale. The background radiation field at 1keV due to clusters
in this model is approximately $1/3$ of the observed background which, after
correction for numerical effects, again indicates approximately 5 times too
much emission and the appropriateness of $\sigma_8=0.6$. If we had used the
observed ratio of gas to total mass in clusters, rather than basing the mean
density on light element nucleosynthesis, then the computed luminosity of each
cluster would have increased still further, by a factor of approximately ten.
Examining the ratio of gas to total mass in the clusters (which we find to be
anti-biased by a factor of approximately 0.6), normalized to $\Omega_b
h^2=0.015$, and comparing to observations, we conclude, in agreement with S.
White, that the cluster observations argue for an open universe.

We present a detailed comparison of the simulation results of various
cosmological hydrodynamic codes. Starting with identical initial conditions
based on the Cold Dark Matter scenario for the growth of structure, we
integrate from redshift $z=20$ to $z=0$ to determine the physical state within
a representative volume of size $L^3$ where $L=64 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. Five
independent codes are compared: three of them Eulerian mesh based and two
variants of the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics "SPH" Lagrangian approach. The
Eulerian codes were run at $N^3=(32^3,~64^3,~128^3,~{\rm and},~256^3)$ cells,
the SPH codes at $N^3= 32^3$ and $64^3$ particles. Results were then rebinned
to a $16^3$ grid with the expectation that the rebinned data should converge,
by all techniques, to a common and correct result as $N \rightarrow \infty$. We
find that global averages of various physical quantities do, as expected, tend
to converge in the rebinned model, but that uncertainties in even primitive
quantities such as $\langle T \rangle$, $\langle \rho^2\rangle^{1/2}$ persists
at the 3\%-17\% level after completion of very large simulations. The two SPH
codes and the two shock capturing Eulerian codes achieve comparable and
satisfactory accuracy for comparable computer time in their treatment of the
high density, high temperature regions as measured in the rebinned data; the
variance among the five codes (at highest resolution) for the mean temperature
(as weighted by $\rho^2$) is only 4.5\%. Overall the comparison allows us to
better estimate errors, it points to ways of improving this current generation
of hydrodynamic codes and of suiting their use to problems which exploit their
individually best features.

The adiabatic criterion, widely used in astronomical dynamics, is based on
the harmonic oscillator. It asserts that the change in action under a slowly
varying perturbation is exponentially small. Recent mathematical results
precisely define the conditions for invariance show that this model does not
apply in general. In particular, a slowly varying perturbation may cause
significant evolution stellar dynamical systems even if its time scale is
longer than any internal orbital time scale. This additional `heating' may have
serious implications for the evolution of star clusters and dwarf galaxies
which are subject to long-term environmental forces. The mathematical
developments leading to these results are reviewed, and the conditions for
applicability to and further implications for stellar systems are discussed.
Companion papers present a computational method for a general time-dependent
disturbance and detailed example.

A new theory of gravitational shocking based on time-dependent perturbation
theory shows that the changes in energy and angular momentum due to a slowly
varying disturbance are not exponentially small for stellar dynamical systems
in general. It predicts significant shock heating by slowly varying
perturbations previously thought to be negligible according to the adiabatic
criterion. The theory extends the scenarios traditionally computed only with
the impulse approximation and is applicable to a wide class of disturbances.
The approach is applied specifically to the problem of disk shocking of star
clusters.

The previous two companion papers demonstrate that slowly varying
perturbations do not result in adiabatic cutoffs and provide a formalism for
computing the long-term effects of time-dependent perturbations on stellar
systems. Here, the theory is implemented in a Fokker-Planck code and a suite of
runs illustrating the effects of shock heating on globular cluster evolution
are described. Shock heating alone results in considerable mass loss for
clusters with $R_g\lta8\kpc$: a concentration $c=1.5$ cluster with $R_g=8\kpc$
loses up to $95\%$ of its initial mass in $15\Gyr$. Only those with
concentration $c\lta1.3$ survive disk shocks inside of this radius. Other
effects, such as mass loss by stellar evolution, will increase this survival
bound. Loss of the initial halo together with mass segregation leads to mass
spectral indices, $x$, which may be considerably larger than their initial
values.

We present results showing an improvement of the accuracy of perturbation
theory as applied to cosmological structure formation for a useful range of
scales. The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of
Friedmann--Lema\^\i tre cosmogonies investigated and solved up to the third
order in the series of papers by Buchert (1989, 1992, 1993), Buchert \& Ehlers
(1993), Buchert (1994), Ehlers \& Buchert (1994), is compared with numerical
simulations. In this paper we study the dynamics of hierarchical models as a
second step. In the first step (Buchert, Melott and Wei{\ss} 1994) we analyzed
the performance of the Lagrangian schemes for pancake models, i.e., models
which initially have a truncated power spectrum. We here explore whether the
results found for pancake models carry over to hierarchical models which are
evolved deeply into the non--linear regime............We find that for spectra
with negative power--index the second--order scheme performs considerably
better than TZA in terms of statistics which probe the dynamics, and slightly
better in terms of low--order statistics like the power--spectrum. In cases
with much small--scale power the gain from the higher--order schemes is small,
but still measurable. However, in contrast to the results found for pancake
models, where the higher--order schemes get worse than TZA at late non--linear
stages and on small scales, we here find that the second--order model is as
robust as TZA, retaining the improvement at later stages and on smaller scales.
In view of these

Since the mass of the electron is very small relative to atomic masses,
Thomson scattering of low-energy photons ($h\nu \ll m_ec^2$) produces thermal
Doppler frequency shifts that are much larger than atomic Doppler widths. A
method is developed here to evaluate the electron scattering emissivity from a
given radiation field which is considerably faster than previous methods based
on straightforward evaluation of the scattering integral. This procedure is
implemented in our multilevel radiative code (MALI), which now takes full
account of the effects of noncoherent electron scattering on level populations,
as well as on the emergent spectrum. Calculations using model atmospheres of
hot, low-gravity stars display not only the expected broad wings of strong
emission lines but also effects arising from the scattering of photons across
continuum edges. In extreme cases this leads to significant shifts of the
ionization equilibrium of helium.

The distributions of peculiar velocities of rich clusters and of groups of
galaxies are investigated for different cosmological models and are compared
with observations. Four cosmological models are studied: standard ($\Omega=1$)
CDM, low-density CDM, HDM ($\Omega=1$), and PBI. We find that rich clusters of
galaxies exhibit a Maxwellian distribution of peculiar velocities in all
models, as expected from a Gaussian initial density fluctuation field. The
cluster 3-D velocity distribution is generally similar in the models: it peaks
at $v \sim 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and extends to high cluster velocities of $v \sim
1500$ km s$^{-1}$. Approximately 10\% of all model rich clusters move with high
peculiar velocities of $v \ge 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. The highest velocity clusters
frequently originate in dense superclusters. The group velocity distribution
is, in general, similar to the velocity distribution of the rich clusters. In
all but the low-density CDM model, the mass exhibits a longer tail of high
velocities than do the clusters. This high-velocity tail originates mostly from
the high velocities that exist within rich clusters. The model velocity
distributions of groups and clusters of galaxies are compared with
observations. The data are generally consistent with the models, but exhibit a
somewhat larger high-velocity tail, to $v_r \sim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$. While this
high-velocity tail is similar to the HDM model predictions, the data are
consistent with the other models studied, including the low-density CDM model,
which best fits most other large-scale structure observations. The observed
velocity

Paczy\'nski (1986) suggested that ``dark" objects in the halo of our Galaxy
could enhance the luminosity of foreground stars, acting as gravitational
microlenses. Such events has been recently reported by different
collaborations. We assume that these microlensing events are produced by
baryonic objects in the halo of our Galaxy. Rather than adopting a mean mass
for the lensing objects we consider them distributed along a mass function
similar to the disk one. Even if the number of microlensing events so far
detected is not large, we show that it is possible to constrain the fraction of
mass density in the halo of our Galaxy in form of stars. We estimate that this
fraction varies between 0.1 and 0.8, if halo stars trace the total halo mass
density; in the opposite case this range becomes narrower. If lensing objects
have not been formed apart from the other halo stars, but in a more general
context of star formation, neutron stars must also be present. We discuss these
results in relation to galactic halo models for gamma-ray bursts.

In the field of planet and proto-planetary disk detection, achieving high
angular resolution and high dynamic range is a necessity. Coronography coupled
with adaptive optics on Hubble Space Telescope is a way to get both good
spatial resolution and high dynamic range. However, because of the residual
figure errors on the primary and on the secondary, HST has a scattered light
level that prevents it from detecting extra-solar planets. Our simulations show
that by using an active mirror (400-1000 actuators) in the optical path of HST
with adaptive optics, we can correct the mirror errors and decrease the
scattering level by a factor $10^{2}$ (from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$ fainter than
the star). Furthermore, by controlling the spatial frequencies of the active
mirror with a {\em dark hole\/} algorithm we can decrease the scattering level
in image zones where planet detection is likely. Using this technique, we have
succeeded in decreasing the scattering level to $3\times 10^{-8}$ of the star
intensity within 1 arcsec from the central star. This will allow the detection
of a Jupiter-like planet $10^{-9}$ times dimmer than the central star located
10 pc away in 1 hour of integration time with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.
This paper describes the method used to determine the actuator strokes applied
to a deformable mirror to achieve planet detection and the design of a
coronograph which implements this novel technique.

Using the covariant approach and conformal transformations, we present a
gauge-invariant formalism for cosmological perturbations in generalized
Einstein theories (GETs), including the Brans-Dicke theory, theories with a
non-minimally coupled scalar field and certain curvature-squared theories. We
find an enhancement in the growth rate of density perturbations in the
Brans-Dicke theory, and discuss attractive features of GETs in the structure
formation process.

Condensed Abstract: We present an extensive study of the inception of
supernova explosions by following the evolution of the cores of two massive
stars (15 Msun and 25 Msun) in two dimensions. Our calculations begin at the
onset of core collapse and stop several 100 ms after the bounce, at which time
successful explosions of the appropriate magnitude have been obtained. (...)
Guided by our numerical results, we have developed a paradigm for the supernova
explosion mechanism. We view a supernova as an open cycle thermodynamic engine
in which a reservoir of low-entropy matter (the envelope) is thermally coupled
and physically connected to a hot bath (the protoneutron star) by a neutrino
flux, and by hydrodynamic instabilities. (...) In essence, a Carnot cycle is
established in which convection allows out-of-equilibrium heat transfer
mediated by neutrinos to drive low entropy matter to higher entropy and
therefore extracts mechanical energy from the heat generated by gravitational
collapse. We argue that supernova explosions are nearly guaranteed and
self-regulated by the high efficiency of the thermodynamic engine. (...)
Convection continues to accumulate energy exterior to the neutron star until a
successful explosion has occurred. At this time, the envelope is expelled and
therefore uncoupled from the heat source (the neutron star) and the energy
input ceases. This paradigm does not invoke new or modified physics over
previous treatments, but relies on compellingly straightforward thermodynamic
arguments. It provides a robust and self-regulated explosion mechanism to power
supernovae which is effective under a wide range of physical parameters.

Interactions of grazing incidence, ultra high energy cosmic rays with the
earth's atmosphere may provide a new method of studying energetic cosmic rays
with gamma-ray satellites. It is found that these cosmic ray interactions may
produce gamma-rays on millisecond time scales which may be detectable by
satellites. An extremely low gamma-ray background for transient gamma-ray
events and a large area of interaction, the earth's surface, make the scheme
plausible. The effective cross section of detection of interactions for cosmic
rays above 10^20 eV is found to be more than two orders of magnitude higher
than earth based detection techniques. This method may eventually offer an
efficient way of probing this region of the cosmic ray energy spectrum where
events are scarce. In this paper, a conceptual model is presented for the
production of short bursts of gamma-rays based on these grazing incidence
encounters with the earth's atmosphere.

The color-magnitude diagrams of $\sim 5\times 10^5$ stars obtained for 13
fields towards the Galactic bulge with the OGLE project reveal a well-defined
population of bulge red clump stars. We find that the distributions of the
extinction-adjusted apparent magnitudes of the red clump stars in fields lying
at $l=\pm5\deg$ in galactic longitude differ by $0.37\pm0.025\;mag$. Assuming
that the intrinsic luminosity distribution of the red clump stars is the same
on both sides of the Galactic center, this implies that the distances to the
red clump stars in the two fields differ by a factor of $1.185\pm0.015$. A
plausible explanation of the observed difference in the luminosity distribution
is that the Galactic bulge is a triaxial structure, or bar, which is inclined
to the line of sight by no more than $45\deg$, with the part of the bar at the
positive galactic longitude being closer to us. This agrees rather well with
other studies indicating the presence of the bar in the center of the Galaxy.
Color-magnitude diagram data are accessible over the computer network with
anonymous {\tt ftp}.

We consider the feasibility of directly observing gravitational microlensing
in extra-galactic sources, whose stars are not generally resolved. This
precludes use of the simple optical depth to microlensing formulation, which is
applicable only to resolved stars. We, instead, extend this method to consider
observational constraints, such as seeing, sky background and minimum
detectable change in magnitude. Our analysis provides quantitative relations
between these constraints and the expected observational results, event
duration and number of detections per year. We find that an ambitious
ground-based observer should detect several events per year in M31. We also
consider detection of microlensing in visual binary galaxies. We find that,
although these objects may present hundreds of events per year, extremely short
durations would yield poor prospects for observation.

We examine the vertical structure and equilibrium of the molecular gas layer
in the galactic disk, measuring its scale height and velocity dispersion as a
function of Galactic radius by modeling the CO emission at the tangent points.
The model takes into account emission from a large path length along the line
of sight, corresponding to an interval \Delta R ~ 200-400 pc; and is
parametrized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z, the rotation
velocity and the velocity dispersion. This model is then fit to the $^{12}CO$
survey of Knapp et al.(1985) to determine the best fit parameters. The reduced
\chi^2 from fitting the models (considering only the photon statistics) range
from 2 to 19. The main source of error is the `shot noise' due to the small
number of clouds. Simulations using discrete molecular clouds are carried out
to estimate the errors. The scale height of the molecular gas increases with
radius. The velocity dispersion varies from ~ 2 km/s to 11 km/s with a typical
uncertainty of ~3 km/s and shows a monotonic increase with galactic radius. The
midplane mass density of the disk calculated from the scale-height and velocity
dispersion is consistent with the local value \rho_0(R_0) of 0.2 \msun pc^{-3}.

A population of molecular clouds with a significantly greater scale height
than that of Giant Molecular Clouds has been identified by examining maps of
the latitude distribution of the $^{12}CO(1-0)$ emission in the first quadrant
of the Galaxy. These clouds are found by identifying emission more than 2.6
times the scale-height away from the galactic midplane (centroid of CO
emission) at the tangent points. Since the distance to the tangent points is
known, we know the height and the sizes of these clouds. They are smaller and
fainter than the GMCs and do not seem to be gravitationally bound. These clouds
have properties similar to the high latitude clouds in the solar neighborhood.
Although they lie outside the molecular cloud layer, the high altitude clouds
are well within the HI layer in the Galaxy and coincide with distinct peaks in
the HI distribution. These clouds represent a galaxy wide population of small
molecular clouds having a larger scale height. They may be clouds in transition
between molecular and atomic phases.

We use N-body simulations to study the shape of mean cluster density and
velocity profiles formed via gravitational instability. The dependence of the
final structure on both cosmology and initial density field is examined, using
a grid of cosmologies and scale-free initial power spectra P\propto k^n. For
each model, we stack clusters to define an average density profile in the
non-linear regime. The profiles are well fit by a power law over 99% of the
cluster volume, with a clear trend toward steeper slopes with both increasing n
and decreasing Omega_o. For models with a Omega_o = 0.2, the profile slopes are
consistently higher than those for Omega-1.0. Cluster density profiles are thus
potentially useful cosmological diagnostics. We find no evidence for a constant
density core in any of the models, although the density profiles do tend to
flatten at small radii. Much of the flattening is due to the force softening
required by the simulations, and an attempt is made to recover the unsoftened
profiles assuming angular momentum invariance. The recovered profiles in the
Omega=1 cosmologies are consistent with a pure power law up to the highest
density contrasts (10^6) accessible with our resolution. The low density models
show significant deviations from a power law above density contrasts \sim 10^5.
We interpret this curvature as reflecting the non scale-invariant nature of the
background cosmology in these models.

We develop a new formalism to study the dynamics of fluid polytropes in three
dimensions. The stars are modeled as compressible ellipsoids and the
hydrodynamic equations are reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations
for the evolution of the principal axes and other global quantities. Both
viscous dissipation and the gravitational radiation reaction are incorporated.
We establish the validity of our approximations and demonstrate the simplicity
and power of the method by rederiving a number of known results concerning the
stability and dynamical oscillations of rapidly rotating polytropes. In
particular, we present a generalization to compressible fluids of
Chandrasekhar's classical results for the secular and dynamical instabilities
of incompressible Maclaurin spheroids. We also present several applications of
our method to astrophysical problems of great current interest such as the
tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole, the coalescence of compact
binaries driven by the emission of gravitational waves, and the development of
instabilities in close binary systems.

We have used 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations to study the
basic properties of the outflow that is created by a protostellar jet in a
dense molecular cloud. The dynamics of the jet/cloud interaction is strongly
affected by the cooling in the shocked gas behind the bow shock at the head of
the jet. We show that this cooling is very rapid, with the cooling distance of
the gas much less than the jet radius. Thus, although ambient gas is initially
driven away from the jet axis by the high thermal pressure odf the post-shock
gas, rapid cooling reduces the pressure and the outflow subsequently evolves in
a momentum-conserving snowplow fashion. The velocity of the ambient gas is high
in the vicinity of the jet head, but decreases rapidly as more material is
swept up. Thus, this type of outflow produces extremely high velocity clumps of
post shock gas which resemble the features seen in outflows. We have
investigated the transfer of momentum from the jet to the ambient medium as a
function of the jet parameters. We show that a low Mach number (<6) jet slows
down rapidly because it entrains ambient material along its sides. On the other
hand, the beam of a high Mach number jet is separated from the ambient gas by a
low density cocoon of post-shock gas, and this jet transfers momentum to the
ambient medium principally at the bow-shock. In high Mach number jets, as those
from young stellar objects, the dominant interaction is therefore at the bow
shock at the head of the jet.

The mass and velocity distributions in the outskirts ($0.5-3.0h^{-1}$Mpc) of
clusters of galaxies are examined for a suite of cosmogonic models utilizing
large-scale Particle-Mesh (PM) simulations ($500^3$ cells, $250^3$ particles
and box size of $100h^{-1}$Mpc, giving a nominal resolution of $0.2h^{-1}$Mpc
with the true resolution about $0.5h^{-1}$Mpc). Through a series of model
computations, designed to isolate the different effects, we find that both
$\Omega_0$ and $P_k$ ($\lambda\le 16h^{-1}$Mpc) are important to the mass and
velocity distributions in clusters of galaxies. More details in the full
abstract.

We have made sensitive 800-micron continuum observations of low-mass,
pre-main sequence (PMS) binary stars with projected separations less than 25 AU
in Taurus-Auriga to study disks in the young binary environment. We did not
detect any of the observed binaries, with typical 3-sigma upper limits of about
30 mJy. Combining our observations with previous 1300-micron observations of
PMS Taurus binaries by Beckwith et al. (1990) and others, we find that the
submillimeter fluxes from binaries with projected separations between 1 AU and
50 AU are significantly lower than fluxes from binaries with projected
separations > 50 AU. The submillimeter fluxes from the wider binaries are
consistent with those of PMS single stars. This may indicate lower disk surface
densities and masses in the close binaries. Alternatively, dynamical clearing
of gaps by close binaries is marginally sufficient to lower their submillimeter
fluxes to the observed levels, even without reduction of surface densities
elsewhere in the disks.

In a recent paper Dar and Shaviv (1994) presented results of calculations
with an improved standard solar model (SSM) that suggest a standard physics
solution to the solar neutrino problem. In a subsequent publication with a
similar title Bahcall et al. (1994) have claimed to refute the results obtained
by Dar and Shaviv. Here we show that the criticism and conclusions of Bahcall
et al. are unjustified. In particular, their attempts to reproduce the results
of Dar and Shaviv failed because they did not use the same nuclear cross
sections and did not include in their calculations major physics improvements
which were included in the improved SSM code used by Dar and Shaviv.

We present results from a four frequency observation of a 6 x 0.6 degree
strip of the sky centered near the star Gamma Ursae Minoris during the fourth
flight of the Millimeter-wave Anisotropy eXperiment (MAX). The observation was
made with a 1.4 degree peak-to-peak sinusoidal chop in all bands. The FWHM beam
sizes were 0.55 +/- 0.05 degrees at 3.5 cm-1 and 0.75 +/-0.05 degrees at 6, 9,
and 14 cm-1. During this observation significant correlated structure was
observed at 3.5, 6 and 9 cm-1 with amplitudes similar to those observed in the
GUM region during the second and third flights of MAX. The frequency spectrum
is consistent with CMB and inconsistent with thermal emission from interstellar
dust. The extrapolated amplitudes of synchrotron and free-free emission are too
small to account for the amplitude of the observed structure. If all of the
structure is attributed to CMB anisotropy with a Gaussian autocorrelation
function and a coherence angle of 25', then the most probable values of
DeltaT/TCMB in the 3.5, 6, and 9 cm-1 bands are 4.3 (+2.7, -1.6) x 10-5, 2.8
(+4.3, -1.1) x 10-5, and 3.5 (+3.0, -1.6) x 10-5 (95% confidence upper and
lower limits), respectively.

We examine the effect of a threshold bias on the power spectrum and the
bispectrum in an ensemble of numerical simulations (Gaussian initial
perturbations with power law spectra P(k) \sim k^n, n=+1, 0, -1, -2) and
compare our results with theoretical predictions. Our simulations are evolved
sufficiently that on the scale where we apply the threshold the rms fluctuation
has developed significantly into the nonlinear regime. Thus, predictions based
on perturbation theory do not necessarily apply. Nevertheless, we find our
results for the power spectrum, biased power simply amplified by a numerical
factor, follow predicted trends, far beyond the regime where perturbation
theory is expected to be valid. We find that the biased bispectrum continues to
follow the so-called hierarchical form, with reduced three-point amplitude Q
\approx 1 in the strongly nonlinear regime, independent of initial spectrum. In
the quasi-linear perturbative regime the three-point amplitude depends on
configuration shape, a behavior that is found to give useful information about
the amount of bias without information about the unbiased matter distribution.

The 'event' that triggers a gamma ray burst cannot last for more than a few
seconds. This is, however, long compared with the dynamical timescale of a
compact stellar-mass object ($\sim 10^{-3}$ seconds). Energy is assumed to be
released as an outflow with high mean lorentz factor $\Gamma$. But a compact
stellar-mass collapse or merger is, realistically, likely to generate a mass
(or energy) flux that is unsteady on some timescales in the range $10^{-3}$ -
10 seconds. If $\Gamma$ fluctuates by a factor of $\sim 2$ around its mean
value, relative motions within the outflowing material will themselves (in the
comoving frame) be relativistic, and can give rise to internal shocks. For
$\Gamma \sim 10^2$, the resultant dissipation occurs outside the 'photosphere'
and can convert a substantial fraction of the overall outflow energy into
non-thermal radiation. This suggests a mechanism for cosmological bursts that
demands less extreme assumptions (in respect of $\Gamma$-values, freedom from
baryonic contamination, etc) than earlier proposals.

We develop a model of SGR in which a supernova leaves planets orbiting a
neutron star in intersecting eccentric orbits. These planets will collide in
$\sim 10^4$ years if their orbits are coplanar. Some fragments of debris lose
their angular momentum in the collision and fall onto the neutron star,
producing a SGR. The initial accretion of matter left by the collision with
essentially no angular momentum may produce a superburst like that of March 5,
1979, while debris fragments which later lose their angular momentum produce an
irregular pattern of smaller bursts.

Time evolution of a circular cosmic string loop is investigated by
numerically solving the field equations for the scalar and the gauge fields
consisting of the vortex. It is shown that the result agrees with an analytic
estimate based on the Nambu-Goto action, which supports its validity in
analyzing nonstraight and rapidly moving strings.

Buzzoni's (1989) grid of synthetic spectral energy distributions,
representative of old stellar populations, was used to derive colours in
different photometric systems, and to compare the theoretical predictions with
the observational data referring to about $120$ globular clusters in the Galaxy
and to $159$ objects of the globular cluster system of M31. Synthetic and
observed indices display an overall agreement in the composite planes of
two-colour diagrams, thus in agreement with the standard evolutionary scenario
leading, for globular clusters, to old stellar populations consistent with an
age of $15$ Gyr and a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF). The two main
parameters modulating the cluster colour distributions are, as known,
metallicity and horizontal branch morphology, while IMF slope and mass loss
rate from stars in the red-giant branch and asymptotic-giant branch
evolutionary stages produce only minor, although not negligible, effects on the
integrated colours. The M31 and Galactic cluster populations are found to be
substantially similar, at least as far as the spectral energy distribution
characteristics in the $U \to V$ spectral range are concerned.

We report on a series of tests of Newtonian Lagrangian perturbation schemes
using N--body simulations for various power--spectra with scale--independent
indices in the range $-3$ to $+1$. The models have been evolved deeply into the
non--linear regime of structure formation in order to probe the dynamical and
statistical performance of the Lagrangian perturbation schemes (whose
first--order solution contains as a subset the celebrated
``Zel'dovich--approximation'' (hereafter ZA). These tests reveal properties of
the approximations at stages beyond the obvious validity of perturbation
theory. Recently, another series of tests of different analytical and
semi--numerical approximations for large--scale structure was conducted with
the result that ZA displays the best dynamical performance in comparison with
the N--body simulations, if the initial data were smoothed before evolving the
model, i.e., a truncated form of ZA (TZA). We show in this Letter that the
excellent performance of TZA can be further improved by going to second order
in the Lagrangian perturbation approach. The truncated second--order Lagrangian
scheme provides a useful improvement over TZA especially for negative power
indices, which suggests it will be very useful for modelling standard scenarios
such as ``Cold--'', ``Hot--'' and ``Mixed--Dark--Matter''.

We extend a newly developed formal system for the description of
astrophysical maps. In this formalism, we consider the difference between maps
to be the distance between elements of a pseudometric space (the space of all
such maps). This ansatz allows us to measure quantitatively the difference
between any two maps and to order the space of all maps. For each physical
characteristic of interest, this technique assigns an ``output'' function to
each map; the difference between the maps is then determined from the
difference between their corresponding output functions. In this present study,
we show that the results of this procedure are invariant under a class of
transformations of the maps and the domains of the maps. In addition, we study
the propagation of errors (observational uncertainties) through this formalism.
We show that the uncertainties in the output functions can be controlled
provided that the signal to noise ratios in the original astrophysical maps are
sufficiently high. The results of this paper thus increase the effectiveness of
this formal system for the description, classification, and analysis of
astrophysical maps.

We present an analysis of IRAS maps of five molecular clouds: Orion,
Ophiuchus, Perseus, Taurus, and Lupus. For the classification and description
of these astrophysical maps, we use a newly developed technique which considers
all maps of a given type to be elements of a pseudometric space. For each
physical characteristic of interest, this formal system assigns a distance
function (a pseudometric) to the space of all maps; this procedure allows us to
measure quantitatively the difference between any two maps and to order the
space of all maps. We thus obtain a quantitative classification scheme for
molecular clouds. In this present study we use the IRAS continuum maps at
100$\mu$m and 60$\mu$m to produce column density (or optical depth) maps for
the five molecular cloud regions given above. For this sample of clouds, we
compute the ``output'' functions which measure the distribution of density, the
distribution of topological components, the self-gravity, and the filamentary
nature of the clouds. The results of this work provide a quantitative
description of the structure in these molecular cloud regions. We then order
the clouds according to the overall environmental ``complexity'' of these star
forming regions. Finally, we compare our results with the observed populations
of young stellar objects in these clouds and discuss the possible environmental
effects on the star formation process. Our results are consistent with the
recently stated conjecture that more massive stars tend to form in more
``complex'' environments.

Relativistic flows resulting from sudden explosive events upscatter ambient
interstellar photons of local radiation fields. For Lorentz factor $ > 100$ and
dense optical - UV radiation fields the emergent signal is a typical gamma ray
burst. Presumably the explosions occur in dense globular clusters or in
galactic nuclei, at cosmological distances.

We have recorded spectra of iron-neon and iron-argon hollow cathode lamps in
the region 1700A -- 5um (59000 -- 2000cm-1), with Fourier transform (FT)
spectrometers at the National Solar Observatory, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.A. and
Imperial College, London, U.K., and with a high resolution grating spectrograph
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, U.S.A. The
uncertainty of the strongest lines in the FT spectra is <0.002cm-1 (0.2mA at
3000A; 8mA at 2um). Pressure and current-dependent shifts are <0.001cm-1 for
transitions between low lying levels, increasing to 0.006 cm-1 for transitions
between the most highly excited levels. We report 28 new energy levels of Fe I
and revised values of another 818 levels. We have identified 9501 lines as due
to 9759 transitions in Fe I, and these are presented in the form of a new
multiplet table and finding list. This compares with the 5500 lines due to 467
energy levels in the multiplet tables of Moore (1950, 1959). The biggest
increase is in the near ultraviolet and near infra-red, and many of the new
lines are present in the solar spectrum. Experimental log(gf) values are
included where available. A further 125 unidentified lines due to Fe I are
given.

The combined laboratory and solar analysis of the highly-excited
subconfigurations 4f and 5g of Fe I has allowed us to classify 87 lines of the
4f-5g supermultiplet in the spectral region 2545-2585 cm-1. The level structure
of these JK-coupled configurations is predicted by semiempirical calculations
and the quadrupolic approximation. Semiempirical gf-values have been calculated
and are compared to gf values derived from the solar spectrum. The solar
analysis has shown that these lines, which should be much less sensitive than
lower excitation lines to departures from LTE and to temperature uncertainties,
lead to a solar abundance of iron which is consistent with the meteoritic value
(A_Fe = 7.51).

We show that the rapid evolution in the fraction of blue, star-forming
galaxies seen in clusters as a function of redshift (the Butcher-Oemler effect)
can be explained very simply if structure formation in the universe proceeeds
hierarchically. We show that a rich cluster observed at high redshift has had a
significantly different evolutionary history to a cluster of the same richness
observed today. High redshift clusters take longer to assemble and thus under-
go more merging at small lookback times. We have investigated two models of
star formation in cluster galaxies: 1) a model in which star formation is
induced by galaxy-galaxy mergers and interactions and 2) a model in which star
formation is regulated by the infall of galaxies onto larger systems such as
groups and clusters. Both models produce trends consistent with the Butcher-
Oemler effect. Our models of cluster formation and evolution allow us to make
predictions about trends in the observed properties of clusters with redshift.
We find that there should be a correlation between the mass of the cluster or
group and the strength of the observed Butcher-Oemler effect, with more massive
systems exhibiting more evolution than less massive systems. We also predict
that both the blue galaxy fraction and the incidence of interacting galaxies in
rich clusters should rise continuously with redshift. Finally, we have explored
the influence of cosmological parameters on our predictions for cluster
evolution. We find that models in which structure formation occurs at very
early epochs, such as low $\Omega$ models, predict rather little recent star
formation and merging activity in clusters at redshifts of around 0.4.

We propose a method for measuring the cosmological density parameter $\Omega$
from the statistics of the divergence field, $\theta \equiv H^{-1} \div v$, the
divergence of peculiar velocity, expressed in units of the Hubble constant, $H
\equiv 100 h km/s/Mpc$. The velocity field is spatially smoothed over $\sim 10
h^{-1} Mpc$ to remove strongly nonlinear effects. Assuming weakly-nonlinear
gravitational evolution from Gaussian initial fluctuations, and using
second-order perturbative analysis, we show that $ <\theta^3> \propto
-\Omega^{-0.6} <\theta^2>^2$. The constant of proportionality depends on the
smoothing window. For a top-hat of radius R and volume-weighted smoothing, this
constant is $26/7-\gamma$, where $\gamma=-d\log <\theta^2> / d\log R$. If the
power spectrum is a power law, $P(k)\propto k^n$, then $\gamma=3+n$. A Gaussian
window yields similar results. The resulting method for measuring $\Omega$ is
independent of any assumed biasing relation between galaxies and mass.
  The method has been successfully tested with numerical simulations. A
preliminary application to real data, provided by the POTENT recovery procedure
from observed velocities favors $\Omega \sim 1$. However, because of an
uncertain sampling error, this result should be treated as an assessment of the
feasibility of our method rather than a definitive measurement of $\Omega$.

A short overview of the direct reaction mechanism and the models used for the
analysis of such processes is given. Nuclear reactions proceeding through the
direct mechanism and involved in solar hydrogen burning are discussed. The
significance of these nuclear reactions with respect to the solar neutrino
problem is investigated.

The aim of this review article is to give a comprehensive description of the
scaling properties detected for the distribution of cosmic structures. Due to
the great variety of statistical methods to describe the large-scale structure
of the Universe, I will mainly concentrate on those methods which reveal
remarkable regularities and scaling in the structure of the Universe. Although
in most cases I prefer not to enter into the technical aspects of how
implementing such methods, more details will be furnishes about the description
of galaxy clustering in terms of fractal concepts. Despite recent claims for a
Universe, which behaves like a fractal at arbitrarily large scales, I will show
that the fractal language can be usefully employed to disprove this picture.
The emerging scenario is that of a Universe, which behaves like a self-similar
structure at small scales, where fractality is dynamically generated by
non-linear gravitational clustering, while preserving large-scale homogeneity.
Nevertheless, even at scales $\magcir 10\hm$, where gravity still acts
linearly, the distribution of galaxy clusters shows remarkable scale-invariant
features, which could give precise hints about the initial conditions for the
evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

An expanding shell is accelerated outward by radiation from the remnant star
and slowed by ram pressure and accretion as it plows into the interstellar
medium. We set up the general relativistic equations of motion for such a
shell. In the non-relativistic limit, the reduce to the standard Ostriker-Gunn
equations. Furthermore, it is shown that the motion equation can be integrated
in general, reducing in this way the study of the dynamics of a shell to a set
of four coupled first order differential equations, solvable up to quadrature

Sudden collapse of a compact object, or coalescence of a compact binary, can
generate an unsteady relativistic wind that lasts for a few seconds. The wind
is likely to carry a high magnetic field; and its Lorentz factor depends on the
extent to which it is 'loaded' with baryons. If the Lorentz factor is $\sim
100$, internal dissipation and shocks in this wind produce a non-thermal
gamma-ray burst, detectable in the range $0.1\MeV \siml E_\gamma \siml
0.1-1\GeV$ out to cosmological distances. The cooled wind ejecta would
subsequently be decelerated by the external medium. The resultant blast wave
and reverse shock can then give rise to a second burst component, mainly
detectable in the GeV range, with a time delay relative to the MeV burst
ranging from minutes to hours.

We report on the first in a series of studies of the Carina dwarf spheroidal
galaxy, a nearby satellite of our Galaxy. Our two major results are: 1) precise
BI photometry ($\sigma_{B-I} \simlt 0.05$ for $V \simlt 22$) for 11,489 stars
in the Carina field, and 2) the detection of two, morphologically distinct,
horizontal branches, which confirms that star formation in Carina occurred in
two well-separated episodes. The old horizontal branch and RR Lyrae instability
strip belong to a > 10 Gyr stellar population, while the populous red-clump
horizontal branch belongs to an approximately 6 Gyr stellar population. We
derive a distance modulus $(m-M)_0=20.09 \pm 0.06$ for Carina from the apparent
magnitudes of the old horizontal branch and the tip of the red giant branch,
and discuss modifications to the previously estimated distance, total
magnitude, and stellar ages. Using the color of the red giant branch, we
estimate the metallicities of the younger and older populations to be [Fe/H] =
-2.0 and -2.2, respectively.

We analyze the properties of a sample of galaxies identified in a 21-cm,
HI-line survey of selected areas in the Perseus-Pisces supercluster and its
foreground void. Twelve fields were observed in the supercluster, five of them
(target fields) centered on optically bright galaxies, and the other seven
(blank fields) selected to contain no bright galaxies. We detected nine
previously uncataloged, gas-rich galaxies, six of them in the target fields. We
also detected HI from seven previously cataloged galaxies in these fields.
Observations in the void covered the same volume as the twelve supercluster
fields at the same HI-mass sensitivity, but no objects were detected. Combining
our HI data with optical broad-band and H-alpha imaging, we conclude that the
properties of HI-selected galaxies do not differ substantially from those of
late-type galaxies found in optical surveys. In particular, the galaxies in our
sample do not appear to be unusually faint for their HI mass, or for their
circular velocity. The previously cataloged, optically bright galaxies in our
survey volume dominate the total HI mass density and cross-section; the
uncataloged galaxies contribute only 19% of the mass and 12% of the
cross-section. Thus, existing estimates of the density and cross-section of
neutral hydrogen, most of which are based on optically-selected galaxy samples,
are probably accurate.

We investigate two possible effects of the tidal field induced by a spherical
cluster on its elliptical galaxy members: the modification of the ellipticity
of a spherical galaxy and the isophotal alignment in the cluster radial
direction of a misaligned prolate galaxy. Numerical N-body simulations have
been performed for radial and circular galactic orbits. The properties of the
stars' zero--velocity surfaces in the perturbed galaxies are explored briefly,
and the adiabaticity of the galaxy to the external field is discussed. For a
choice of parameters characteristic of rich clusters we find that the induced
ellipticity on a spherical galaxy is below or close to the detectability level.
But we find that the tidal torque can result in significant isophotal alignment
of the galaxies' major axis with the cluster radial direction if the galaxy is
outside the cluster core radius. The time required for the alignment is very
short compared with the Hubble time. A significant increase in the ellipticity
of the outer isophotes of the prolate model is also found, but with no
observable isophotal twisting. Our main prediction is an alignment segregation
of the elliptical galaxy population according to whether their orbits lie
mostly outside or inside the cluster core radius. These results also suggest
that galactic alignment in rich clusters is not incompatible with a bottom-up
galaxy formation scenario.

Differential rotation between the neutron star crust and a more rapidly
rotating interior superfluid leads to frictional heating that affects the
star's long-term thermal evolution and resulting surface emission. Here we
present the results of thermal evolution simulations based on two models of the
vortex pinning forces that bracket a range of plausible pinning strengths. We
include the effects of superfluidity, magnetic fields, and temperature
gradients. As representative standard and accelerated neutrino emission
processes taking place in the core, we consider the modified Urca process in
normal baryonic matter, and the much faster quark Urca process. Comparison of
our results with neutron star surface temperature data, including the recent
temperature measurement of the Geminga pulsar, shows that stars with soft
equations of state and modest frictional heating are in closest agreement with
the data; stars with stronger frictional heating have temperatures inconsistent
with the upper limit of PSR 1929+10. Stiffer stars undergoing standard cooling
generally have temperatures lying above the Vela detection, a situation
worsened by the inclusion of frictional heating. Stars undergoing accelerated
cooling without frictional heating have temperatures that fall far below most
temperature measurements; the Vela and Geminga detections being the most
compelling examples. Only in stiff stars, which have thick crusts, can the
inclusion of strong frictional heating raise the temperature at late stages in
the evolution to a level consistent with the data. However, such a large amount
of heating leads to a temperature at $\sim 1000$ yr in excess of the Crab upper
limit. Suppression of accelerated neutrino emission processes, perhaps by
superfluid pairing in the core, may yield acceptable cooling models.

Tidal interaction in a coalescing neutron star binary can resonantly excite
the g-mode oscillations of the neutron star when the frequency of the tidal
driving force equals the intrinsic g-mode frequencies. We study the g-mode
oscillations of cold neutron stars using recent microscopic nuclear equations
of state, where we determine self-consistently the sound speed and
Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency in the nuclear liquid core. The properties of the
g-modes associated with the stable stratification of the core depend
sensitively on the pressure-density relation as well as the symmetry energy of
the dense nuclear matter. The frequencies of the first ten g-modes lie
approximately in the range of $10-100$ Hz. Resonant excitations of these
g-modes during the last few minutes of the binary coalescence result in energy
transfer and angular momentum transfer from the binary orbit to the neutron
star. The angular momentum transfer is possible because a dynamical tidal lag
develops even in the absence of fluid viscosity. However, since the coupling
between the g-mode and the tidal potential is rather weak, the amount of energy
transfer during a resonance and the induced orbital phase error are very small.
Resonant excitations of the g-modes play an important role in tidal heating of
binary neutron stars. Without the resonances, viscous dissipation is effective
only when the stars are close to contact. The resonant oscillations result in
dissipation at much larger orbital separation. The actual amount of tidal
heating depends on the viscosity of the neutron star. Using the microscopic
viscosity, we find that the binary neutron stars are heated to a temperature
$\sim 10^8$ K before they come into contact.

A test mass, $M$, moving through an ambient medium of light particles with
lower average kinetic energy than itself suffers a deceleration caused by its
scattering of the light particles. The phenomenon is usually referred to as
dynamical friction. The velocity, $\v$, of the test mass decays on a timescale
independent of $\v$ in the non-relativistic case. We derive expressions for
dynamical friction in the case that the test mass and the light particles are
relativistic, and that the scattering is weak (with impact parameter, $b\gg
M$). In the case that the light particles are ultra-relativistic, and isotropic
in the frame in which $M$ moves with velocity $v$, we find an explicit
expression for the dynamical friction. The well known factor of 2 correcting
the Newtonian scattering of photons to give the Einstein angle, $4M/b$, has the
largest effect on the resulting friction, which is modified by a factor of
roughly $16 / 3\gamma_v$ over the simple non-relativistic case. In the
non-relativistic case, the largest contribution to the friction comes from
light particles moving slower than $v$. We find that this is not the case for
ultra-relativistic scattering, essentially because the scattering angle is
independent of $\v$. Some astrophysical implications are discussed. (Accepted

A model is presented for the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood
which takes into account three families of galactic objects, according to their
condensation states: stars, refuses and gas. Stars are defined as every
condensed objects with masses greater than or equal to the minimum mass which
ignites hydrogen and which will give rise to an evolutionary track on the HR
diagram to the left of Hayashi's limit; refuses include the remnants, which are
compact objects resulting from stellar deaths, and the residues, which have
masses not large enough to ignite hydrogen; gas is defined as the mass which
can be condensed to form stars and/or residues. We have developed equations for
the mass evolution of each family, and have studied the gas metallicity
distribution within the framework of the instantaneous recycling approximation,
adopting different initial conditions. In order to constrain the model
parameters we have also used preliminary evaluations of comet cloud masses to
investigate the role of the residues as sinks of heavy elements in the Galaxy.

Optical spectropolarimetry of the luminous IRAS source FSC10214$+$4724
(z$=2.286$) reveals that the strong (\twid17\%) linear polarization detected by
Lawrence \etal\/ is shared by both the narrow UV emission lines and the
underlying continuum. This observation and the brightness of the source rule
out synchrotron emission and dichroic extinction by dust as the polarizing
mechanism, leaving scattering as the only plausible cause of the polarized
emission. The narrowness of the lines requires that the scatterers be dust
grains or cool ($<1.6\times$10$^4$~K) electrons. We can recover the spectrum
that is incident on the scattering medium provided we make some reasonable
assumptions regarding the source geometry. The scattered UV spectrum has a
power law index $\alpha$~ of $-1.2 \pm 0.6$ ($F_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha$), steeper
than what would be expected from a young burst of star formation, but similar
to many AGN.

We analyze the Ginga LAC and Einstein SSS spectra of four cooling flow
clusters, A496, A1795, A2142 and A2199, each of which shows firm evidence of a
relatively cool component. The inclusion of such cool spectral components in
joint fits of SSS and LAC data leads to somewhat higher global temperatures
than are derived from the high energy LAC data alone. We find little evidence
of cool emission outside the SSS field of view. Metal abundances appear to be
centrally enhanced in all four cluster, with varying degrees of model
dependence and statistical significance: the evidence is statistically
strongest for A496 and A2142, somewhat weaker for A2199 and weakest for A1795.
We also explore the model-dependence in the amount of cold, X-ray absorbing
matter discovered in these clusters by White et al. (1991).

The possibility that the form of the inflationary potential can be
reconstructed from a knowledge of the primordial power spectra of scalar
(density) and tensor (gravity wave) perturbations is discussed and reviewed. It
is suggested that measurements of the scalar spectral index and the amplitude
of the tensor spectrum at one scale should be possible in the near future. This
would be sufficient to determine whether the potential is convex or concave
over the limited region relevant to the formation of large-scale structure in
the universe. Such information would provide an `observation' of physics at
energy scales above $10^{14}$GeV. $^*$Invited talk presented at {\em The Second
Alexander Friedmann International Seminar on Gravitation and Cosmology, St.
Petersburg, Russia, 12th-19th September 1993.}

Non-Gaussian distributions of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
have been proposed to reconcile the discrepancies between different experiments
at half-degree scales (Coulson et al. 1994). Each experiment probes a different
part of the sky, furthermore, sky coverage is very small, hence the sample
variance of each experiment can be large, especially when the sky signal is
non-Gaussian. We model the degree-scale CMB sky as a $\chi_{n}^{2}$ field with
$n$-degrees of freedom and show that the sample variance is enhanced over that
of a Gaussian distribution by a factor of $ {(n +6)/ n}$. The sample variance
for different experiments are calculated, both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian
distributions.
  We also show that if the distribution is highly non-Gaussian $(n \ltwid 4)$
at half-degree scales, then the non-Gaussian signature of the CMB could be
detected in the FIRS map, though probably not in the COBE map.

There are four important facts about solar neutrinos. They are listed in
order of importance in this abstract and discussed more in the text of the
talk. First, solar neutrinos have been detected in four experiments with
approximately the energies and fluxes predicted by the standard solar model,
confirming the hypothesis that the energy source for the solar luminosity is
the fusion of light elements. Second, the measured event rates are significantl
less than the event rates predicted by the combined standard solar and
electroweak models in all four experiments. Third, a comparison of the event
rates measured in the chlorine experiment (threshold 0.8 Mev) and the
neutrino-electron scattering experiment (Kamiokande II, threshold 7.5 MeV)
indicates that the deficiency of electron-type neutrinos at the earth is energy
dependent, if the rates and the uncertainties in both experiments have been
correctly understood. The inference that the deficiency is energy-dependent
conflicts with the simplest version of standard electroweak theory. Fourth,
experiments are being constructed that have the capabilities to determine
conclusively if new neutrino physics is required.

We calculate the spectrum of photons resulting from electromagnetic cascades
through thermal radiation, and examine the consequences of including triplet
production in these cascades. We assume that the cascade is one-dimensional,
and we find that this approximation is justified in the present work for
thermal radiation with temperature less than $10^{-3} mc^2$. Results are
obtained for both monoenergetic and power-law primary spectra, and for a
variety of path lengths. We find that triplet production is particularly
important in electron--photon cascades through thermal radiation when the
primary energy exceeds $10^5 m^2c^4/kT$ for propagation over small path
lengths. The importance of triplet production decreases as the path length
increases, and it has no effect on saturated cascades.

We present results from two four-frequency observations centered near the
stars Sigma Hercules and Iota Draconis during the fourth flight of the
Millimeter-wave Anisotropy eXperiment (MAX). The observations were made of 6 x
0.6-degree strips of the sky with 1.4-degree peak to peak sinusoidal chop in
all bands. The FWHM beam sizes were 0.55+/-0.05 degrees at 3.5 cm-1 and a
0.75+/-0.05 degrees at 6, 9, and 14 cm-1. Significant correlated structures
were observed at 3.5, 6 and 9 cm-1. The spectra of these signals are
inconsistent with thermal emission from known interstellar dust populations.
The extrapolated amplitudes of synchrotron and free-free emission are too small
to account for the amplitude of the observed structures. If the observed
structures are attributed to CMB anisotropy with a Gaussian autocorrelation
function and a coherence angle of 25', then the most probable values are
DT/TCMB = (3.1 +1.7-1.3) x 10^-5 for the Sigma Hercules scan, and DT/TCMB =
(3.3 +/- 1.1) x 10^-5 for the Iota Draconis scan (95% confidence upper and
lower limits). Finally a comparison of all six MAX scans is presented.

Using a new, second-order accurate numerical method we present dynamical
simulations of oblique MHD cosmic ray (CR) modified plane shock evolution using
the two-fluid model for diffusive particle acceleration. The numerical shocks
evolve to published analytical steady state properties. In order to probe the
dynamical role of magnetic fields we have explored for these time asymptotic
states the parameter space of upstream fast mode Mach number, $M_f$, and plasma
$\beta$, compiling the results into maps of dynamical steady state CR
acceleration efficiency, $\epsilon_c$. These maps, along with additional
numerical experiments, show that $\epsilon_c$ is reduced through the action of
compressive work on tangential magnetic fields in CR-MHD shocks. Thus
$\epsilon_c$ in low $\beta$, moderate $M_f$ shocks tends to be smaller in quasi
perpendicular shocks than it would be high $\beta$ shocks of the same $M_f$.
This result supports earlier conclusions that strong, oblique magnetic fields
inhibit diffusive shock acceleration. For quasi parallel shocks with $\beta <
1$, on the other hand, $\epsilon_c$ seems to be increased at a given $M_f$ when
compared to high $\beta$ shocks. The apparent contradiction to the first
conclusion results, however, from the fact that for small $\beta$ quasi
parallel shocks, the fast mode Mach number is not a good measure of compression
through the shock. That is better reflected in the sonic Mach number, which is
greater. Acceleration efficiencies for high and low $\beta$ having comparable
sonic Mach numbers are more similar. Time evolution of CR-MHD shocks is
qualitatively similar to CR-gasdynamical shocks. However, several potentially
interesting differences are apparent.

We describe a numerical code to solve the equations for ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It is based on an explicit finite difference scheme
on an Eulerian grid, called the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme, which
is a second-order-accurate extension of the Roe-type upwind scheme. We also
describe a nonlinear Riemann solver for ideal MHD, which includes rarefactions
as well as shocks and produces exact solutions for two-dimensional magnetic
field structures as well as for the three-dimensional ones. The numerical code
and the Riemann solver have been used to test each other. Extensive tests
encompassing all the possible ideal MHD structures with planar symmetries (\ie
~one-dimensional flows) are presented. These include those for which the field
structure is two-dimensional ({\it i.e.}, those flows often called ``$1 + 1/2$
dimensional'') as well as those for which the magnetic field plane rotates
({\it i.e.,}, those flows often called ``$1 + 1/2 + 1/2$ dimensional'').
Results indicate that the code can resolve strong fast, slow, and magnetosonic
shocks within 2-4 cells while more cells are required if shocks become weak.
With proper stiffening, rotational discontinuities are resolved within 3-5
cells. Contact discontinuities are also resolved within 3-5 cells with
stiffening and 6-8 cells without stiffening, while the stiffening on contact
discontinuities in some cases generates numerical oscillations. Tangential
discontinuities spread over more than 10 cells. Our tests confirm that slow
compound structures with two-dimensional magnetic field are composed of
intermediate shocks (so called ``2-4''

The Bloated Stars Scenario proposes that AGN broad line emission originates
in the winds or envelopes of bloated stars (BS). Its main advantage over BLR
cloud models is the gravitational confinement of the gas and its major
difficulty the large estimated number of BSs and resulting high mass loss rate.
We calculate the emission line spectrum by a detailed numerical photoionization
code for a wide range of wind structures and a detailed QSO nucleus model with
L(ion)=7E45 erg/s, M(bh)=8E7 Mo. The size and boundary density of the wind are
determined by various processes: Comptonization by the central ionizing source
(calculated self consistently), tidal disruption by the black hole and the
limit set by the wind's finite mass. We find that the emission spectrum is
mainly determined by the conditions at the boundary of the line emitting
fraction of the wind rather than by its internal structure. Comptonization
results in very high ionization parameters at the boundary which produces an
excess of unobserved broad high excitation forbidden lines. The finite mass
constraint limits the wind size, increases the boundary density and thus
improves the results. Slow decelerating mass-constrained flows with high gas
densities (1E8-1E12 cm^-3) are as success- ful as clouds in reproducing the
observed lines. Only 5E4 dense wind BSs are required in the inner 1/3 pc. This
small fraction approaches that of super- giants (SG) in the solar neighborhood
and the mass loss is consistent with the observational constraints. The BS
number is a very sensitive function of the wind structure. SG-like BSs are
ruled out by their high mass loss. BSs with dense winds can reproduce the BLR
line spectrum and be supported by the stellar population without excessive mass
loss and collisional destruction rates.

We present the results of two-dimensional radiation-gasdynamic simulations of
aspherical Planetary Nebulae (PNe) evolution. These simulations were
constructed using the Generalized Interacting Stellar Winds (GISW) scenario of
Balick (1987) where a fast, tenuous wind from the central star expands into a
toroidal, slow, dense wind. We demonstrate that the GISW model can produce a
wide range of aspherical flow patterns.
  We have constructed self-consistent synthetic observations of the models from
forbidden line emissivities used in the energy loss term. We present integrated
intensity and long-slit spectrum, (Position-Velocity) maps of the models
projected at different angles on the sky. These synthetic observations are
compared with real intensity and Position-Velocity maps of PNe. We find that
there is a very good match between the synthetic and real observations in terms
of morphologies, kinematics, and physical conditions.
  From the results of these simulations we conclude that the GISW scenario can
account for most, if not all, PNe morphologies, thus confirming Balick's (1987)
conjecture.

We have observed a sample of 157 Seyfert galaxies with a 275 km baseline
radio interferometer to search for compact, high brightness temperature radio
emission from the active nucleus. We obtain the surprising result that compact
radio cores are much more common in Seyfert 2 than in Seyfert 1 galaxies, which
at first seems to be inconsistent with orientation unification schemes. We
propose a model, involving optical depth effects in the narrow-line region,
which can reconcile our result with the standard unified scheme. (Accepted for
publication in ApJ 1994 Sep 10)

We discuss the effects of redshift--space distortions on the estimate of high
order galaxy correlation functions. We use both the Perseus--Pisces redshift
survey and the results of high--resolution N--body simulations to explore the
consequences of working in redshift space on the detection of deviations from
hierarchical clustering. Both for real and simulated data, significant
deviations from hierarchical clustering seem to be present in real space. Their
behaviour is coherent with that expected from an initially biased galaxy field,
once the displacement from the sites where galaxies formed, due to the
nonlinear gravitational evolution, is taken into account. The passage to
redshift space has the net effect of filtering out the higher powers required
to fit the distribution in real space. This magnifies the distortions operated
by nonlinear evolution on the initial distribution, erasing the residual narrow
scale range (2--5~$h^{-1}$Mpc) where deviations from hierarchical clustering
are still detectable in real space. We conclude that such deviations can hardly
be estimated using data in redshift space.

We compute the fluctuations in gravitational lens image positions and time
delay caused by large scale structure correlations. We show that these
fluctuations can be expressed as a simple integral over the density power
spectrum. Using the {\sl COBE} normalization we find that positions of objects
at cosmological distances are expected to deviate from their true positions by
a few arcminutes. These deflections are not directly observable. The positions
of the images relative to one another fluctuate by a few percent of the
relative separation, implying that one does not expect multiple images to be
produced by large scale structures. Nevertheless, the fluctuations are larger
than the observational errors on the positions and affect reconstructions of
the lens potential. The time delay fluctuations have a geometrical and a
gravitational contribution. Both are much larger than the expected time delay
from the primary lens, but partially cancel each other. We find that large
scale structure weakly affects the time delay and time delay measurements can
be used as a probe of the distance scale in the universe.

A break in the distribution function of Ly$\alpha$ clouds (at a typical
redshift of $2.5$) has been reported by Petitjean et al. (1993). This feature
is what would be expected from a transition between pressure confinement and
gravity confinement (as predicted in Charlton, Salpeter, and Hogan (1993)). The
column density at which the feature occurs has been used to determine the
external confining pressure, $\sim 10 {\rm cm}^{-3} {\rm K}$, which could be
due to a hot, intergalactic medium. For models that provide a good fit to the
data, the contribution of the gas in clouds to $\Omega$ is small. The specific
shape of the distribution function at the transition (predicted by models to
have a non-monotonic slope) can serve as a diagnostic of the distribution of
dark matter around Ly$\alpha$ forest clouds, and the present data already
eliminate certain models.

$\gamma$-ray bursts have baffled theorists ever since their accidental
discovery at the sixties. We suggest that these bursts originate in merger of
neutron star binaries, taking place at cosmological distances. These mergers
release $\approx 10^{54}ergs$, in what are possibly the strongest explosions in
the Universe. If even a small fraction of this energy is channeled to an
electromagnetic signal it will be detected as a grbs. We examine the virtues
and limitations of this model and compare it with the recent Compton \g-ray
observatory results. We also discuss the potential application of grbs to study
cosmology and show that these burst might lead to a new and independent
determination of both $H_0$ and $\Omega$.

We report the discovery of a new SNR in the \ros All-Sky-Survey data. The SNR
has a nearly circular shape with a diameter of about 15 arcmin. The surface
brightness is rather uniform over the remnant. The observed interstellar
absorption suggests a distance of about 1.8$^{+1.4}_{-0.8}$ kpc. The X-ray
emission appears to be of thermal origin with a plasma temperature of about
10$^7$ K. The Sedov model leads to an age of only 1800 years. We find no
spectral evidence of non-thermal emission in the center of the remnant. The two
most likely explanations for the centrally filled structure are evaporation of
shock heated clouds in the interior of the remnant or a reverse shock heating
the ejecta of the SNR explosion.

We describe a Bayesian methodology to evaluate the consistency between the
reported Ginga and BATSE detections of absorption features in gamma ray burst
spectra. Currently no features have been detected by BATSE, but this
methodology will still be applicable if and when such features are discovered.
The Bayesian methodology permits the comparison of hypotheses regarding the two
detectors' observations, and makes explicit the subjective aspects of our
analysis (e.g., the quantification of our confidence in detector performance).
We also present non-Bayesian consistency statistics. Based on preliminary
calculations of line detectability we find that both the Bayesian and
non-Bayesian techniques show that the BATSE and Ginga observations are
consistent given our understanding of these detectors.

The enclosed paper was submitted for publication in Ap.J Lett. in February
1992. It has been rejected on the grounds that it predicts primordial Deuterium
abundance which is contradicted by observations and because it disagreed with
published analysis and conclusions of previous authors. However, in a recent
article in NATURE (14 April 1994) Vol. 368 pp. 599-603, Songalia, Cowie, Hogan
and Rugers describe a recent measurement (November 1993) with the Keck 10-m
Telescope, of the Deuterium abundance in a high redshift cloud between us and a
distant quasar. They find D/H\approx 1.9-2.5 x10^{-4} in good agreement with
our prediction D/H=(2.1+\- 0.35)x10^{-4}, which is larger by an order of
magnitude than believed before. Songalia et al. found that the baryon density
inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is "consistent with the amount of
presently observed luminous matter comprising all the baryons in the Universe"
while we found the same. We post here our unpublished 1991 paper, which was
reported in international conferences and was distributed only as a preprint,
mainly because of its physics and its sad moral: If you submit for publication
a correct paper with important results that contradict the "party line" it has
only slim chances to be accepted for publication.

We examine the multi--point velocity field for non--Gaussian models as a
probe of non--Gaussian behavior. The two--point velocity correlation is not a
useful indicator of a non--Gaussian density field, since it depends only on the
power spectrum, even for non--Gaussian models. However, we show that the
distribution of velocity differences $\bfv_1 - \bfv_2$, where $\bfv_1$ and
$\bfv_2$ are measured at the points $\bfr_1$ and $\bfr_2$, respectively, is a
good probe of non--Gaussian behavior, in that $p(\bfv_1 - \bfv_2)$ tends to be
non--Gaussian whenever the density field is non--Gaussian. As an example, we
examine the behavior of $p(\bfv_1 - \bfv_2)$ for non--Gaussian seed models, in
which the density field is the convolution of a distribution of points with a
set of density profiles. We apply these results to the global texture model.

We present an analytical model for the non-spherical collapse of overdense
regions out of a Gaussian random field of initial cosmological perturbations.
The collapsing region is treated as an ellipsoid of constant density, acted
upon by the quadrupole tidal shear from the surrounding matter. The dynamics of
the ellipsoid is set by the ellipsoid self-gravity and the external quadrupole
shear. Both forces are linear in the coordinates and therefore maintain
homogeneity of the ellipsoid at all times. The amplitude of the external shear
is evolved into the non-linear regime in thin spherical shells that are allowed
to move only radially according to the mass interior to them. We describe how
the initial conditions can be drawn in the appropriate correlated way from a
random field of initial density perturbations. By considering many random
realizations of the initial conditions, we calculate the distribution of shapes
and angular momenta acquired by objects through the coupling of their
quadrupole moment to the tidal shear. The average value of the spin parameter,
0.04, is found to be only weakly dependent on the system mass, the mean
cosmological density, or the initial power spectrum of perturbations, in
agreement with N-body simulations. For the cold dark matter power spectrum,
most objects evolve from a quasi-spherical initial state to a pancake or
filament and then to complete virialization. Low-spin objects tend to be more
spherical. The evolution history of shapes is primarily induced by the external
shear and not by the initial triaxiality of the objects. The statistical
distribution of the triaxial shapes of collapsing regions can be used to test
cosmological models against galaxy surveys on large scales.

We have cross-correlated the galaxies from the IRAS 2 Jy redshift survey
sample and the 0.7 Jy projected sample with the all-sky cosmic X-ray background
(CXB) map obtained from the HEAO-1 A2 experiment. We have developed a
formulation to model the cross-correlation between CXB surface brightness and
galaxy counts. This includes the effects of source clustering and the X-ray --
far infrared luminosity correlation. Using an X-ray flux limited sample of
AGNs, which has IRAS 60 $\mu m$ measurements, we have estimated the
contribution of the AGN component to the observed CXB -- IRAS galaxy count
correlations in order to see whether there is an excess component, i.e.
contribution from low X-ray luminosity sources. We have applied both the
analytical approach and Monte-Carlo simulations for the estimations. Our
estimate of the local X-ray volume emissivity in the 2 -- 10 keV band is
consistent with the value expected from the luminosity function of AGNs alone
and the contribution to the local volume emissivity from lower-luminosity
sources is small.

We investigate the impact of hierarchical galaxy merging on the statistics of
gravitational lensing of distant sources. Since no definite theoretical
predictions for the merging history of luminous galaxies exist, we adopt a
parametrized prescription, which allows us to adjust the expected number of
pieces comprising a typical present galaxy at z=0.65. The existence of global
parameter relations for elliptical galaxies and constraints on the evolution of
the phase space density in dissipationless mergers, allow us to limit the
possible evolution of galaxy lens properties under merging.
  We draw two lessons from implementing this lens evolution into statistical
lens calculations: (1) The total optical depth to multiple imaging (e.g. of
quasars) is quite insensitive to merging. (2) Merging leads to a smaller mean
separation of observed multiple images. Because merging does not reduce
drastically the expected lensing frequency it cannot make $\lambda$-dominated
cosmologies compatible with the existing lensing observations. A comparison
with the data from the HST Snapshot Survey shows that models with little or no
evolution of the lens population are statistically favored over strong merging
scenarios. The specific merging scenario proposed by Toomre (1977) can be
rejected (95\% level) by such a comparison. Some versions of the scenario
proposed by Broadhurst, Ellis \& Glazebrook (1992), are statistically
acceptable.

We present the results of self-consistent models of Compton-heated accretion
disk coronae. The models are calculated using a new method for computing
monochromatic radiative transfer in two-dimensions. The method splits the
radiation into direct and scattered components. The direct radiation is
computed by calculating the optical depth along rays, while transfer of the
scattered radiation is approximated by flux-limited diffusion. The resulting
code agrees with more accurate treatments to within 50\%, and is highly
efficient, making it practical for use in large hydrodynamic simulations. The
coronal models are used to confirm the results of earlier work, and to extend
it to higher luminosities. In contrast to earlier work, which found the outer
disks to be shadowed by the inner corona at high luminosities, we find our
results to form an almost continuous extension of the models at lower
luminosities. This is due to the presence of multiply-scattered radiation,
which acts to partially offset the loss of direct radiation from the central
source. Although the analytic methods derived at lower luminosities cannot be
used to derive the coronal structure for $L/L\sr{Edd}\gapprox0.1$, the results
of the models are amenable to semiempirical fits. We also discuss possible
observational consequences of the results for coronal veiling and line
fluorescence from the disk.

The least action principle (LAP) is a dynamically rigorous method for
deriving the history of galaxy orbits. In particular it is an Omega_0 test,
predicting current epoch galaxy velocities as a function of position and of the
cosmological background. It is most usefully applied to in--falling structures,
such as the local group, where its application indicates that the preferred
cosmological model is Omega_0 = 0.1 and h=0.75 (h is the Hubble parameter in
units of 100 Km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The method assumes that all the mass acts as if
it were distributed as the visible galaxies. We test the reliability of the LAP
to Local Group-like systems extracted from Omega_0=1 N--body simulations. While
the orbits of the galaxies are qualitatively well reconstructed, the LAP
systematically underestimates the mass of the system. This failure is
attributed to the presence of extended halos weakly clustered around visible
galaxies which prevent a large fraction of the group mass from being detected
by the LAP technique. We conclude that the LAP method cannot rule out an
Omega_0=1 value on the Local Group scale. Better constraints on Omega_0 may be
obtained by applying this technique to in--falling systems, such as clusters,
containing objects with separations large compared to galaxy sizes.

Recent solar neutrino results together with the assumption of a stationary
Sun imply severe constraints on the individual components of the total neutrino
flux : $\Phi_{Be} \leq 0.7 \cdot 10^{9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, \Phi_{CNO} \leq 0.6
\cdot 10^{9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ and $64 \cdot 10^{9} cm^{-2} s^{-1} \leq
\Phi_{pp+pep} \leq 65 \cdot 10^{9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ (at 1$ \sigma$ level), the
constraint on $\nu_{Be}$ being in strong disagreement with $\Phi_{Be}^{SSM} = 5
\cdot 10^{9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. We study a large variety of non-standard solar
models with low inner temperatures, finding that the temperature profiles T(m)
follow the homology relationship: T(m)=k$T(m)^{SSM}$, so that they are
specified just by the central temperature $T_{c}$. There is no value of $T_{c}$
which can account for all the available experimental results and also if we
restrict to consider just Gallium and Kamiokande results the fit is poor.
Finally we discuss what can be learned from new generation experiments, planned
for the detection of monochromatic solar neutrinos, about the properties of
neutrinos and of the Sun.

The dynamical instability of a self-gravitating magnetized filamentary cloud
was investigated while taking account of rotation around its axis. The
filamentary cloud of our model is supported against self-gravity in part by
both a magnetic field and rotation. The density distribution in equilibrium was
assumed to be a function of the radial distance from the axis, $ \rho _0 (r) \,
= \, \rho _{\rm c} \, ( 1 \, + \, r ^2 / 8 H ^2 ) ^{-2} $, where $ \rho _{\rm
c} $ and $ H $ are model parameters specifying the density on the axis and the
length scale, respectively; the magnetic filed was assumed to have both
longitudinal ($z$-) and azimuthal ($\varphi$-) components with a strength of $
B _0 (r) \, \propto \, \sqrt{ \rho _0 (r) } $. The rotation velocity was
assumed to be $ v _{0\varphi} \, = \, \Omega _{\rm c} \, r \, (1 \, + \, r ^2 /
8 H ^2 ) ^{-1/2} $. We obtained the growth rate and eigenfunction numerically
for (1) axisymmetric $ ( m \, = \, 0 ) $ perturbations imposed on a rotating
cloud with a longitudinal magnetic field, (2) non-axisymmetric $ ( m \, = \, 1
) $ perturbations imposed on a rotating cloud with a longitudinal magnetic
filed, and (3) axisymmetric perturbations imposed on a rotating cloud with a
helical magnetic field. The fastest growing perturbation is an axisymmetric one
for all of the model clouds studied. Its wavelength is $ \lambda _{\rm max} \,
\le \, 11.14 \, H $ for a non-rotating cloud without a magnetic field, and is
shorter

We consider the production of high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays in
radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN) or in the central regions of
radio-loud AGN. We use a model in which acceleration of protons takes place at
a shock in an accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole, and follow the
cascade that results from interactions of the accelerated protons in the AGN
environment. We use our results to estimate the diffuse high energy neutrino
intensity and cosmic ray intensity due to AGN. We discuss our results in the
context of high energy neutrino telescopes under construction, and measurements
of the cosmic ray composition in the region of the ``knee'' in the energy
spectrum at $\sim 10^7$ GeV.

We have used recent observations of helium-4, nitrogen and oxygen from some
four dozen, low metallicity, extra-galactic HII regions to define mean $N$
versus $O$, $^4He$ versus $N$ and $^4He$ versus $O$ relations which are
extrapolated to zero metallicity to determine the primordial $^4He$ mass
fraction $Y_P$. The data and various subsets of the data, selected on the basis
of nitrogen and oxygen, are all consistent with $Y_P = 0.232 \pm 0.003$. For
the 2$\sigma$ (statistical) upper bound we find $Y_P^{2\sigma} \le 0.238$.
Estimating a 2\% systematic uncertainty $(\sigma _{syst} = \pm 0.005)$ leads to
a maximum upper bound to the primordial helium mass fraction: $Y_P^{MAX} =
Y_P^{2\sigma} + \sigma_{syst} \le 0.243$. We compare these upper bounds to
$Y_P$ with recent calculations of the predicted yield from big bang
nucleosynthesis to derive upper bounds to the nucleon-to-photon ratio $\eta$
($\eta_{10} \equiv 10^{10}\eta$) and the number of equivalent light (\lsim 10
MeV) neutrino species. For $Y_P \le 0.238$ ($0.243$), we find $\eta_{10} \le
2.5 (3.9)$ and $N_\nu \leq 2.7 (3.1)$. If indeed $Y_P \le 0.238$, then BBN
predicts enhanced production of deuterium and helium-3 which may be in conflict
with the primordial abundances inferred from model dependent (chemical
evolution) extrapolations of solar system and interstellar observations. Better
chemical evolution models and more data - especially $D$-absorption in the QSO
Ly-$\alpha$ clouds - will be crucial to resolve this potential crisis for BBN.
The larger upper bound, $Y_P \leq 0.243$ is completely

Deep Hubble Space Telescope images of superlative resolution obtained for the
distant rich cluster AC114 (z=0.31) reveal a variety of gravitational lensing
phenomena for which ground-based spectroscopy is available. We present a
luminous arc which is clearly resolved by HST and appears to be a lensed z=0.64
sub-L star spiral galaxy with a detected rotation curve. Of greatest interest
is a remarkably symmetrical pair of compact blue images separated by 10 arcsec
and lying close to the cluster cD. We propose that these images arise from a
single very faint background source gravitationally lensed by the cluster core.
Deep ground-based spectroscopy confirms the lensing hypothesis and suggests the
source is a compact star forming system at a redshift z=1.86. Taking advantage
of the resolved structure around each image and their very blue colours, we
have identified a candidate third image of the same source roughly 50 arcsec
away. The angular separation of the three images is much larger than previous
multiply-imaged systems and indicates a deep gravitational potential in the
cluster centre. Resolved multiply-imaged systems, readily recognised with HST,
promise to provide unique constraints on the mass distribution in the cores of
intermediate redshift clusters.

We study the microwave background anisotropy due to superhorizon-size
perturbations (the Grischuk-Zel'dovich effect) in open universes with negative
spatial curvature. Using COBE results on the low-order temperature multipole
moments, we find that if the homogeneity of the observable Universe arises from
an early epoch of inflation, the present density parameter cannot differ from
unity by more than the observed quadrupole anisotropy, $|1-\Omega_0| \alt Q
\simeq 5\times 10^{-6}$. Thus, inflation models with low $\Omega_0$ either do
not fit the microwave background observations or they do not solve the horizon
problem.

To understand better the early galactic production of Li, Be, and B by cosmic
ray spallation and fusion reactions, the dependence of these production rates
on cosmic ray models and model parameters is examined. The sensitivity of
elemental and isotopic production to the cosmic ray pathlength magnitude and
energy dependence, source spectrum, spallation kinematics, and cross section
uncertainties is studied. Changes in these model features, particularly those
features related to confinement, are shown to alter the Be- and B-versus-Fe
slopes {}from a na\"{\i}ve quadratic relation. The implications of our results
for the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background are examined, and the role of chemical
evolution and its relation to our results is noted. It is also noted that the
unmeasured high energy behavior of $\alpha+\alpha$ fusion can lead to effects
as large as a factor of 2 in the resultant yields. Future data should enable
Population II Li, Be, and B abundances to constrain cosmic ray models for the
early Galaxy.

Although Potent purports to use only radial velocities in reconstructing the
potential velocity field of galaxies, the derivation of transverse components
is implicit in the smoothing procedures adopted. Thus the possibility arises of
using nonradial line integrals to derive a smoothed velocity field. For an
inhomogeneous galaxy distribution the optimal path for integration need not be
radial, and can be obtained using max-flow algorithms. In this paper we
describe how one may use Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain this optimal path and
velocity field, and present the results of applying the algorithm to a
realistic spatial distribution of galaxies. These results show that the method
has limited effect due to the large smoothing scales employed in Potent.
However, the viability of the technique is demonstrated and, finally, we
discuss other possible methods involving averaging over an ensemble of
non-radial paths for improving a potential velocity field derived from
redshifts.

We present an analysis of the far-ultraviolet upturn phenomenon (UVX)
observed in elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges. Our premise is that
the UV radiation from these systems emanates primarily from extreme horizontal
branch (EHB) stars and their progeny. We re-derive the broad-band UV colors
$1500-V$ and $2500-V$ for globular clusters and elliptical galaxies from the
available satellite data and investigate color-color and color-line strength
correlations. We also provide the ingredients necessary for constructing models
with arbitrary HB morphologies.

Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) are a class of rare, high-energy galactic
transients that have episodes of short (~0.1 sec), soft (~30 keV), intense
(~100 Crab), gamma-ray bursts. We report an analysis of the x-ray emission from
95 SGR1806-20 events observed by the International Cometary Explorer. The
spectral shape remains remarkably constant for bursts that differ in intensity
by a range of 50. Below 15 keV the number spectrum falls off rapidly such that
we can estimate the total intensity of the events. Assuming that SGR1806-20 is
associated with the supernova remnant G10.0-0.3 (Kulkarni and Frail, Murakami
\etal), the brightest events had a total luminosity of ~1.8 x 10^42 erg sec^-1,
a factor of 2 x 10^4 above the Eddington limit. A third of the emission was
above 30 keV. There are at least three processes that are consistent with the
spectral rollover below 15 keV. (1)The rollover is consistent with some forms
of self absorption. Typical thermal temperatures are ~20 keV and require an
emitting surface with a radius between 10 and 50 km. The lack of spectral
variability implies that only the size of the emitting surface varies between
events. If the process is thermal synchrotron the required magnetic field might
be too small to confine the plasma against the super Eddington flux. (2)The low
energy rollover could be due to photoelectric absorption by ~10^24 Hydrogen
atoms cm^-2 of neutral material with a cosmic abundance assuming a continuum
similar to TB with T= ~22 keV. (3) Emission in the two lowest harmonics from a
1.3 x 10^12 Gauss field would appear as Doppler broadened lines and fall off
rapidly below 15 keV.

Supermassive black holes are investigated as possible sources for
low-frequency bursts of gravity waves. The event rate for `known' supermassive
black holes at intermediate and high redshifts, inferred from the quasar
luminosity function, is low $\sim 0.1 \yr^{-1}$. A space-based interferometer
could therefore only see several events per year from supermassive black holes
if an additional population of supermassive black holes existed and emitted
gravitational waves efficiently. These might reside in the population of dwarf
galaxies or in a transient population of small dark matter haloes that have
mostly merged into larger haloes hosting the galaxies seen today. The proposed
space-based gravitational-wave interferometer LISA/SAGITTARIUS should detect
most gravitational-wave events involving supermassive black holes above $10^{4}
\Msol$ out to redshifts of $z \sim 100$.

The delayed hard (up to 25 GeV) photons observed more than an hour following
a gamma-ray burst on February 17, 1994 may result from the collisions of
relativistic nucleons with a dense cloud, producing $\pi^0$. The required cloud
density is $\sim 2 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. This cloud may be the remains of
the disrupted envelope of a neutron star, and may survive as an excretion disc
of $\sim 10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ cm radius around the coalescing binary.

We consider the spectrum of primordial fluctuations produced by inflationary
models where the inflaton potential is the sum of two exponential terms. A wide
range of spectra result, with the only constraint being that the scalar
spectrum must have more tilt than the tensor spectrum. This model can mimic the
spectra of most inflationary models, as well as producing combinations of
scalar and tensor perturbations not found in common varieties of slow-rolling
inflation.

Short abstract: We present fully 3-D simulations of supersonic, radiatively
cooling intermittent jets with intermediate and long variability periods (that
is, periods of the order of or longer than, the dynamical time scale of the
jet). Variations of intermediate period elucidate the formation and evolution
of chains of internal regularly spaced radiative shocks, which in this work are
identified with the observed emission knots of protostellar jets. Variations of
long period elucidate the formation of multiple bow shock structures separated
by long trails of diffuse gas, which resemble those observed in systems like
HH111 and HH46/47. The time variability of the outflow is probably associated
with observed irruptive events in the accretion process around the protostars.
In our simulations, the outflow variations are produced by periodically turning
on the outflow with a highly supersonic velocity and periodically turning off
it to a low velocity regime. In the case of velocity variations of intermediate
period, we find, as in previous work, that the shock structures form a train of
regularly spaced emitting features which move away from the source with a
velocity close to that of the outflow, have high radial motions, and produce
low intensity spectra, as required by the observations. As they propagate
downstream, the shocks widen and dissipate due to the expulsion of material
sideways to the cocoon by the high pressure gradients of the postshock gas.
This fading explains the most frequent occurence of knots closer to the driving
source. In the case of the long period velocity variability, our simulations
have produced a pair of bow-shock-like structures separated by a trail almost

The gravitational evolution of the genus of the density field in large-scale
structure is analytically studied in a weakly nonlinear regime using
second-order perturbation theory. Weakly nonlinear evolution produces asymmetry
in the symmetric genus curve for Gaussian initial density field. The effect of
smoothing the density field in perturbation theory on the genus curve is also
evaluated and gives the dependence of the asymmetry of the genus curve on
spectra of initial fluctuations.

Two groups have independently reported the possible detection of
extragalactic deuterium in the absorption spectrum of the same high redshift,
low metalicity QSO. Although the high value for the inferred deuterium
abundance poses no problems for cosmology (i.e., big bang nucleosynthesis), it
is in apparent conflict with solar system observations of deuterium and
helium-3. This latter inconsistency is explained and made quantitative and it
is shown that, unless the inferred D/H ratio is too high by a factor of three,
these data challange our understanding of the stellar and galactic evolution of
helium-3. This conflict is resolved if the observed absorption feature is, in
fact, due to a hydrogen interloper rather than to high z, low Z deuterium.

We use numerical simulation to investigate the triggering of starbursts in
merging disk galaxies. The properties of the merger-driven starbursts are
sensitive to the structure of the progenitor galaxies; specifically, to the
amount of material in a dense central bulge. Galaxies without bulges develop
bars shortly after their first close passage, driving significant gas inflow
and subsequent starbursts in the centers of the galaxies. These starbursts
significantly deplete the star-forming gas, so that only relatively weak
starbursts arise during the final merger. By contrast, models of galaxies with
central bulges show that a bulge acts to stabilize the galaxies against inflow
and starbursts until the galaxies actually merge. At this time, strong
dissipation leads to the formation of a massive central gas mass and an ensuing
star formation rate two orders of magnitude greater than that in our isolated
disk models. These starbursts are very short in duration, typically $\sim$ 50
Myr, suggesting that the rarity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies is a result
of their being in a very short evolutionary phase, rather than special and rare
formation conditions. The fact that these mergers display many of the
properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies -- tidal features, double nuclei,
massive compact gas concentrations, and extreme levels of starburst activity --
suggests that merger-driven starbursts can explain the emission from many
ultraluminous infrared galaxies without an active nucleus.

We discuss whether the astrophysical objects responsible for the recently
reported microlensing events of sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud can be
identified as the brown dwarf components of the spheroid of our galaxy, rather
than the constituents of a dark baryonic halo.

We generalize previous work on early photoionization to CDM models with
Omega<1. Such models have received recent interest because the excess power in
the large-scale galaxy distribution is phenomenologically fit if the ``shape
parameter" Gamma=h Omega_0 is about 0.25. It has been argued that such models
may require early reionization to suppress small-scale anisotropies in order to
be consistent with experimental data. We find that if the cosmological constant
lambda=0, the extent of this suppression is quite insensitive to Omega_0. Given
a sigma_8-normalization today, the loss of small-scale power associated with a
lower Omega_0 is partially canceled by higher optical depth from longer
lookback times and by structures forming at higher redshifts before the
universe becomes curvature-dominated. The maximum angular scale on which
fluctuations are suppressed decreases when Omega_0 is lowered, but this effect
is also rather weak and unlikely to be measurable in the near future. For flat
models, on the other hand, where lambda_0 = 1-Omega_0, the negative effects of
lowering Omega_0 dominate, and early reionization is not likely to play a
significant role if Omega_0<<1. The same applies to CDM models where the
effective Gamma is lowered by increasing the number of relativistic particle
species.

We find a coupling of Pseudo Nambu Goldstone bosons (PNGBs) to other
(ordinary) scalars, and consider its importance in various contexts. Our
original motivation was the model of Double Field inflation [1]. We also
briefly consider the role of this coupling for the case of the QCD axion.

We present new radio observations of the ``prototypical'' ultra-luminous far-
infrared galaxy NGC~6240, obtained using the VLA at 20~cm in `B' configuration
and at 3.6~cm in `A' configuration. These data, along with those from four
previous VLA observations, are used to perform a comprehensive study of the
radio emission from NGC~6240. Approximately 70\% (~3 x 10$^{23}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$)
of the total radio power at 20 cm originates from the nuclear region ( <~ 1.5
kpc), of which half is emitted by two unresolved ($R <~ 36 pc) cores and half
by a diffuse component. The radio spectrum of the nuclear emission is
relatively flat ($\alpha$ =~ 0.6; $S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$). The
supernova rate required to power the diffuse component is consistent with that
predicted by the stellar evolution models of Rieke \etal (1985). If the radio
emission from the two compact cores is powered by supernova remnants, then
either the remnants overlap and form hot bubbles in the cores, or they are very
young ( <~ 100 yr). Nearly all of the other 30\% of the total radio power comes
from an ``arm-like'' region extending westward from the nuclear region. The
western arm emission has a steep spectrum ($\alpha$ =~ 1.0), suggestive of
aging effects from synchrotron or inverse-Compton losses, and is not correlated
with starlight; we suggest that it is synchrotron emission from a shell of
material driven by a galactic superwind. Inverse-Compton scattering of
far-infrared photons in the radio sources is expected to produce an X-ray flux
of ~2-6 x 10$^{-14}$ erg/s/cm2 in the 2-10 keV band. No significant radio
emission is detected from or near the possible ultra-massive ``dark core''
hypothesized by Bland-Hawthorn, Wilson \& Tully (1991).

The H magnitude aperture data published by the Aaronson et al. collaboration
over a 10-year period is collected into a homogeneous data set of 1731
observations of 665 galaxies. 96\% of these galaxies have isophotal diameters
and axial ratios determined by the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies
(de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), the most self-consistent set of optical data
currently available. The precepts governing the optical data in the RC3 are
systematically different from those of the Second Reference Catalogue (de
Vaucouleurs, de Vaucouleurs and Corwin 1976), which were used by Aaronson et
al. for their original analyses of galaxy peculiar motions. This in turn leads
to systematic differences in growth curves and fiducial H magnitudes, prompting
the present recalibration of the near-infrared Tully Fisher relationship. New
optically-normalized H magnitude growth curves are defined for galaxies of
types S0 to Im, from which new values of fiducial H magnitudes, H$\rm
_{-0.5}^g$, are measured for the 665 galaxies. A series of internal tests show
that these four standard growth curves are defined to an accuracy of 0.05 mag
over the interval $\rm -1.5 \leq \log (A/D_g) \leq -0.2$. Comparisons with the
Aaronson et al. values of diameters, axial ratios and fiducial H magnitudes
show the expected differences, given the different definitions of these
parameters. The values of H$\rm _{-0.5}^g$ are assigned quality indices; a
value of 1 indicates an accuracy of $<$0.2 magnitude; Quality 2 indicates an
accuracy of 0.2 to 0.35 mag; and Quality 3 indicates $>$0.35 mag. Revised
values of corrected HI velocity widths are also given, based on the new set of
axial ratios defined by the RC3.

Using a radiation-gasdynamics code the evolution of spherical planetary
nebulae is followed, while taking into account the evolution of central star
and the fast wind. These models show the importance of ionization fronts for
the structure of planetary nebulae, especially for the so called multiple shell
nebulae (MSPNe). It is shown that the outer shell is formed by the ionization
front while the inner shell is swept-up by the fast wind. These models explain
the emission profiles of the outer shells as well as their various kinematic
properties. Because they are shaped by the ionization front these outer shells
only give indirect information on the AGB mass loss history. The models
indicate that typical MSPN structures point to mass loss variations during the
AGB phase. The ionization also leads to a stalling of the expansion of the
nebula, leading to nebulae with expansion ages lower than their evolutionary
age. Values for ionized mass and Zanstra temperatures are derived from the
models.

New additional equations for the Newtonian dynamical systems on Riemannian
manifolds are found. They supplement the previously found weak normality
conditions up to the complete normality conditions for Newtonian dynamical
systems.

A scheme is developed which enables one to trace backwards in time the cosmic
density and velocity fields, and to determine accurately the current-epoch
velocity field from the current-epoch density field, or vice versa. The scheme
implements the idea of Giavalisco \etal\ (1993) that the principle of least
action should be used to formulate gravitational instability as a two-point
boundary-value problem. We argue that the Eulerian formulation of the problem
is to be preferred to the Lagrangian one, on grounds of computational
simplicity, of ease of interfacing with observational data, and of internal
consistency at early times. The scheme is successfully tested on an exact
solution in one dimension, and on currently Gaussian fields in one and two
dimensions. The application of the scheme to real observational data appears to
be eminently feasible, though computationally costly.

We investigate the evolution of a massive black hole pair under the action of
dynamical friction (DF) by a uniform background of light stars with isotropic
velocity distribution. In our scenario, the primary black hole $M_1$ sits, at
rest, in the center of the spherical star distribution (with mass $M_c$) and
the secondary less massive companion $M_2$ moves along bound orbits determined
by the background gravitational field; it loses energy $E$ and angular momentum
$J$ by DF. We investigate mostly analytically the secular evolution of the
orbital parameters when the motion of $M_2$ is determined either by the mean
field generated by the uniform stellar distribution or by the gravitational
field of $M_1$. We find that $J$ and $E$ are lost so as to cause the increase
of the eccentricity $e$ during the orbital decay of $M_2$. When $M_2$ enters
the region where the gravitational field of $M_1$ dominates, the evolution
depends on the ratio between the black hole velocity $v$ and the stellar
dispersion velocity $\sigma.$ We explore both cases $v<\sigma$ and $v>\sigma$.
Only for $v>\sigma$ the rise of $e$ would be severe but this transition occurs
close to the cusp radius below which our description becomes invalid. Energy
losses by gravitational wave emission become comparable to those by dynamical
friction at a critical distance that depends sensitively on the ratio
$M_1/M_c$. The braking index $n$ is calculated in this transition region.

The negative evolution found in X--ray clusters of galaxies limits the amount
of available hot gas for the inverse Compton scattering of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect). Using a parametrisation of the
X-ray luminosity function and its evolution in terms of a coalescence model (as
presented in the analysis of a flux limited X-ray cluster sample by Edge et al.
1990), as well as a simple virialised structure for the clusters (which
requires a gas to total mass fraction $\approxgt 0.1$ in order to reproduce
observed properties of nearby clusters) we show that the Compton distortion $y$
parameter is about two orders of magnitude below the current FIRAS upper
limits. Concerning the anisotropies imprinted on arcmin scales they are
dominated by the hottest undetected objects. We show that they are negligible
(${\Delta T\over T}\approxlt 10^{-7}$) at wavelengths $\lambda\approxgt 1$~mm.
At shorter wavelengths they become more important (${\Delta T\over T}\sim
10^{-6}$ at $\lambda\sim 0.3$~mm), but in fact most clusters will produce an
isolated and detectable feature in sky maps. After removal of these signals,
the fluctuations imprinted by the remaining clusters on the residual radiation
are still much smaller. The conclusion is that X-ray clusters can be ignored as
sources of Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations.

Motivated by the recent report of a $^6$Li detection in the atmosphere of
HD~84937, we couple stellar evolution calculations with light isotope
production via stellar flares. We find that as a consequence of their small
convective envelope mass near the turn-off point, low-metallicity dwarfs and
subgiants may possess observable amounts of $^6$Li arising from such flare
activity. We point out an observational test which could discriminate between
flare produced $^6$Li and protostellar $^6$Li. In the $T_{\rm eff}$ range
$6000-6600$~K, the $^7$Li/$^6$Li ratio on the subgiant branch should increase
as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$ if flare production is important, whereas the
same ratio should be constant if a protostellar origin is the source of the
observed lithium. The absence of a flare produced variation in the
$^7$Li/$^6$Li ratio would allow for a more reliable inference of the --
cosmologically important -- atmospheric depletion mechanisms in stars.

We present a study of the distribution of quasars and radio galaxies in the
plane (viewing angle - redshift) in the framework of the evolutionary unified
scheme (Vagnetti et al. 1991). Results are presented for some illustrative
cases, including a distribution of the Lorentz factors, and appropriate
luminosity functions for quasars and their host galaxies. A cosmologically
increasing <Gamma> is found, in agreement with the previous paper. It is argued
that the appearence of sources as quasars or radio galaxies can depend on the
viewing angle and on the redshift, due to the balance between the beamed
component and the luminosity of the host galaxy. Within the assumptions of our
evolutionary unified scheme, we find that low-Gamma objects can be observed as
quasars mainly at z<~0.3, while a substantial fraction of the low-z radio
galaxies could consist of quasar-remnants.

We study $e^{\pm}$ pair plasmas in pair equilibrium, which emit high energy
radiation by thermal Comptonization of soft photons. We find that the maximum
luminosity to size ratio of the source (i.e. the compactness) depends not only
on the hot plasma temperature, but also on the spectral index of the resulting
Comptonized spectrum. In the observationally interesting range, sources of same
compactness can be hotter if their spectrum is steeper. Instruments observing
in the 50--500 keV energy range, such as OSSE on board CGRO, and especially the
future SAX satellite, can be more successful in detecting sources moderately
steep, the flattest sources being characterized by an high energy cut--off at
too low frequencies. For any given pair of values of spectral index and
temperature, Comptonization theory alone fixes the $ratio$ of the compactnesses
in hard and soft photons. However, if the source is pair dominated, the
absolute values of the two compactnesses are fixed. Therefore there is a a
one--to--one correspondence between the physical parameters of the source (the
compactnesses in soft and hard photons) and the observable quantities (spectral
index and temperature). This correspondence can be extremely useful in
interpreting the physical behaviour of the sources, especially during
variations, and can help discriminating between different models for the high
energy emission of compact sources.

The DENIS 2 micron survey is described. It's ability to probe galaxies at
very low galactic latitudes is computed using simulated images. This analysis
indicates that DENIS will be able to separate galaxies from stars, right
through the Galactic Plane, for galactic longitudes $45^\circ \leq \ell \leq
315^\circ$, with a maximum loss in the magnitude limit for reliable extraction
of $\simeq 1.2$ magnitude relative to that at the Galactic Pole (where the 92\%
reliability limit is $K' = 13.2$ for star/elliptical galaxy separation, and
fainter for other morphological types). Extinction corrected magnitude limits
are substantially worse, but for $|b| \geq 2^\circ$, they are within one
magnitude from that of the Galactic Poles. Thus, confusion by stars will not
prevent the establishment of a reliable galaxy catalog right through the
Galactic Plane. However, extinction will produce galaxies of lower surface
brightness, which will be more difficult to detect.

We consider the joint probability distribution function for the mass contrast
and angular momentum of over-density regions on the proto- galactic scale and
investigate the formation of massive black holes at redshift $z\gsim10$. We
estimate the growth rate of the angular momentum by the linear perturbation
theory and the decay rate by the Compton drag and apply the Press-Schechter
theory to obtain the formation rate of massive black holes, assuming the full
reionization of the universe at $z=z_{ion}\gg 10$. We find the correlation
between the mass contrast and angular momentum vanishes in the linear theory.
However, application of the Press-Schechter theory introduces a correlation
between the mass contrast and angular momentum of bound objects. Using thus
obtained probability distribution, we calculate the mass fraction of black
holes with $M\sim10^6-10^8M_{\odot}$ in the universe. We find that it crucially
depends on the reionization epoch $z_{ion}$. Specifically, for the standard CDM
power spectrum with the COBE normalization, the condition $z_{ion}\gsim 500$
must be satisfied to reproduce the observed number density of QSOs.

This paper is concerned with collisionless aspects of the early evolution of
model star clusters. The effects of mass loss through stellar evolution and of
a steady tidal field are modelled using $N$-body simulations. Our results
(which depend on the assumed initial structure and the mass spectrum) agree
qualitatively with those of Chernoff \& Weinberg (1990), who used a
Fokker-Planck model with a spherically symmetric tidal cutoff. For those
systems which are disrupted, the lifetime to disruption generally exceeds that
found by Chernoff \& Weinberg, sometimes by as much as an order of magnitude.
Because we do not model collisional effects correctly we cannot establish the
fate of the survivors. In terms of theoretical interpretation, we find that
tidal disruption must be understood as a loss of {\sl equilibrium}, and not a
loss of {\sl stability}, as is sometimes stated.

We propose that the X--ray emission from radio quiet AGN and galactic black
holes is due to Comptonization of soft thermal photons emitted by the
underlying accretion disk in localized structures (blobs). The power per unit
area produced by the blobs, impinging on the disk, can easily dominate the
radiation internally produced by the disk. In this case the electron
temperature and the high energy spectrum can be determined in a similar way as
in the previously studied homogeneous model (Haardt \& Maraschi 1991). However
in the present model: a) the emitted spectrum is largely independent of the
{\it fraction} of gravitational power dissipated in the blobs; b) the X--ray
spectrum can be harder depending on a form factor of the blobs; c) the UV (or
soft X--ray for galactic objects) luminosity that is not intercepted by the
blobs can be larger than the X--ray luminosity. In the framework of a
simplified accretion disk $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, we make order of
magnitude estimates of the number of active blobs, their size, luminosity and
hence their compactness, finding values in agreement with what is observed. The
expected UV to X--ray spectra and correlations of X--ray and UV light curves
are discussed.

Energy production due to the Casimir effect is considered for the case of a
superdense state of matter, which can appear in such cosmological objects as
white dwarfs, neutron stars, quasars and so on. The energy output produced by
the Casimir effect during the creation of a neutron star turns out to be
sufficient to explain nova and supernova explosions. It is shown that the
Casimir effect might be a possible source of the huge energy output of quasars.

Molecular outflows associated with GL 2591 and W28 A2 were observed in the
492 GHz [CI] line. Upper limits are set on the [CI] emission in the extremely
high velocity line wings. These limits are discussed in terms of wind-driven
and jet-driven models of molecular outflows.

Luminous objects associated with the 7.06\arcsec\ separation double quasar
Q2345+007 have, until now, escaped detection. In this letter we present the
results of the deepest known imaging of the region surrounding the quasar. The
total exposure times were 47600 seconds in B$_j$ (101 frames) and 32160 seconds
in R (82 frames). The frames came from CFHT, CTIO, and KPNO. We detect a B$_j$
= 25.0 mag galaxy (B$_j$ -- R = 0.5 mag) in close proximity to the fainter QSO
image, possibly at $z = 1.49$ given by several absorption features in the QSO
spectra. Furthermore, there is a 2.9$\sigma$ enhancement in the number density
of faint galaxies ($24 \le$ B$_j$ $\le 28$, B$_j-$ R $ \le 1.5$) near the
quasar and another 3.1$\sigma$ enhancement further away. These discoveries
support the hypothesis that Q2345+007 is being lensed by one or more distant
mass concentrations and may imply that compact ``clusters'' already exist at
early epochs. We discuss several lens models for the system and the
cosmological implications.

Long arcs in clusters of galaxies, produced by gravitational lensing, can be
used to estimate the mass interior to the arcs and therefore, constrain the
cluster mass distribution. The radial density distribution of the intracluster
gas (ICM) can be extracted from the X-ray surface brightness observations. If
the gas temperature is also known, it is then possible to probe the dynamical
state of the gas and test whether the ICM is in hydro- static equilibrium
within the gravitational potential of the cluster as a result of thermal
pressure support. We analyze three clusters that exhibit large arcs, whose
X-ray surface brightness profiles have been observed, and whose gas
temperatures have been determined. In two of the clusters, A2218 and A1689, the
central mass implied by lensing is a factor of $2$--$2.5$ too large for the gas
at the observed temperature to be in hydrostatic equilibrium solely due to
thermal pressure support. In other words, if we accept the mass estimate
derived from the lensing analysis and demand that the X-ray surface brightness
profile be consistent with the observations, the required gas temperature is a
factor of $2$--$2.5$ higher than observed. The results for the third cluster,
A2163 (the most luminous and the hottest cluster known), are more ambiguous.
The discrepancy between the X-ray and the lensing mass estimates arise because
the presence of arcs imply a highly concentrated cluster mass distribution
whereas the observed X-ray profiles imply a more extended mass distribution.
The large X-ray core radii are not the result of the limited resolution of the
X-ray detectors. We consider various possibilities that could account for the
discrepancy.

A model for stationary, radiatively driven winds from X--ray bursting neutron
stars is presented. General relativistic hydrodynamical and radiative transfer
equations are integrated from the neutron star surface outwards, taking into
account for helium nuclear burning in the inner, dense, nearly hydrostatic
shells. Radiative processes include both bremsstrahlung emission--absorption
and Compton scattering; only the frequency--integrated transport is considered
here. It is shown that each solution is characterized by just one parameter:
the mass loss rate $\Mdot$, or, equivalently, the envelope mass $\Menv$. We
found that, owing to the effects of Comptonization, steady, supersonic winds
can exist only for $\Mdot$ larger than a limiting value $\Mdot_{min}
\approx\Mdot_{E}$. Several models, covering about two decades in mass loss
rate, have been computed for given neutron star parameters. We discuss how the
sequence of our solutions with decreasing $\Menv$ can be used to follow the
time evolution of a strong X--ray burst during the expansion/contraction phase
near to the luminosity maximum. The comparison between our numerical results
and the observational data of Haberl {\it et al.\/} (1987) for the bursts in
4U/MXB 1820-30 gives an estimate for both the spectral hardening factor and the
accretion rate in this source.

We present estimates for the accretion rates in 13 X--ray bursting sources
which exhibit photospheric expansion, basing on theoretical models of
stationary, radiatively driven winds from neutron stars. The relatively high
values obtained, $\Mdot_{acc}\magcir 10^{-9} \MS$, are in accordance with
theoretical limits for unstable helium burning, and, at the same time, almost
never exceed the ``dynamical'' limit for stationary accretion, $\sim 10
\Mdot_{Edd}$. The only exceptions are 1820-30, already known to be a very
peculiar object, and 1608-522; there are indications, however, that in both
sources, accretion could be non--stationary.

One of the main properties of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars is a very intense outflow
of gas. No less than 40\% \ of WR stars belong to binary systems. Young massive
O and B stars are the secondary components of such systems. OB stars also have
an intense stellar wind.
  If the intensities of the stellar winds of WR and OB stars are more or less
comparable or if the distance between the components of the binary is large
enough, the winds flowing out of WR and OB stars can collide and the shock
waves are formed. In the shock the gas is heated to temperature $\sim 10^7$ K
and generates X-ray emission.
  Stellar wind collision may be responsible not only for the X-ray emission of
WR + OB binaries and for their radio, IR and $\gamma$-ray emision as well.
Stellar wind collision, gas heating, particle acceleration, and generation of
X-ray, $\gamma$-ray, radio and IR emission in WR + OB binaries are discussed.

We have determined chemical abundances and radial velocities for stars in the
field of the zeta Sculptoris cluster. We find that the cluster metal deficiency
previously found from UBV photometry is too high; the cluster overall
metallicity, [Fe/H]=+0.24, is about 70% higher than the solar value. The
chemical abundance pattern is unusual: the Ni/Fe ratio is significantly lower
than typical for field stars with similar Fe and Ca abundances, and the cluster
may also be deficient in the alpha element Si. For its age, the cluster is
unusually far from the galactic disk, approximately 240 pc. The adopted
heliocentric cluster radial velocity, +3.9 km/s, shows that it is close to its
maximum distance from the galactic plane. We suggest that the zeta Sculptoris
cluster was formed in the galactic disk 45 Myr ago by the interaction of a high
velocity cloud with the interstellar medium, and that its formation may be
connected with that of Gould's Belt. (Table3, postscript figures and text

An atlas of deep, wide-field R-band CCD images of a complete sample of
distant, X-ray-selected clusters of galaxies is presented. These clusters are
the 41 most distant (z>= 0.15) and most X-ray luminous (Lx >= 2x10**44 erg\s-1)
clusters in the Einstein Observatory Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS)
catalog that are observable from Mauna Kea (delta > -40 deg). The sample spans
a redshift range of 0.15 <= z < 0.81 and includes at least 2 and possibly as
many as 6 rich clusters with z>0.5. For the most part, the data are of superior
quality, with a median seeing of 0''.8 FWHM and coverage of at least 1 Mpc X 1
Mpc in the cluster frame (Ho=50; q0=1/2). In addition, we update the available
optical, X-ray and radio data on the entire EMSS sample of 104 clusters. We
outline the cluster selection criteria in detail, and emphasize that
X-ray-selected cluster samples may prove to be more useful for cosmological
studies than optically selected samples. The EMSS cluster sample in particular
can be exploited for diverse cosmological investigations, as demonstrated by
the detection of evolution in the X-ray luminosity function previously
reported, and more recently by the discovery of a large number of
gravitationally lensed images in these clusters.

We show that observational data for four Abell clusters of galaxies support
the Gur\-za\-dyan-Kocharyan relation between the Hausdorff dimension and the
dynamical properties of a galaxy system. The Hausdorff dimension is calculated
using the two-point correlation function, while the dynamical parameters are
estimated using available data and reasonable assumptions on the mass function
of galaxies. This result can have essential consequences in the understanding
of the dynamical mechanisms that determine the fractal distribution of
galaxies.

Recent observations by the ROSAT X-ray satellite of the Vela supernova
remnant have revealed, in addition to the previously identified compact nebula,
a nearly circular emitting region with a radius of about 4 degrees. The Vela
pulsar is slightly off the center of this circular region, consistent with its
measured proper motion of about 100km/s and an age of about 10^4 yr. The
emitting region is bounded by the main supernova shock. Just outside the shock,
the X-ray image reveals several well-defined V-shaped features extending
radially outwards. These features are most likely wakes produced by objects
moving supersonically through the outside medium. The shapes and orientations
of the wakes suggest that these objects have been ejected from the center of
the supernova explosion. Their present positions indicate that they have been
moving with a mean velocity of a few thousand km/s. We show that pre-existing
objects, such as planets in orbit around the progenitor star, could not have
been accelerated to sufficiently high velocities or would have been destroyed.
Instead, we propose that the observed objects are fragments ejected during the
formation of the neutron star. Fragmentation during gravitational collapse is a
natural consequence of both convective and rotational instabilities.

If the COBE detection of CMB fluctuations is used to normalize the power
spectrum of primordial density fluctuations in a cold dark matter--dominated
universe, early reionization is likely to result in a substantial diminution of
primordial temperature fluctuations on degree scales. I argue that the
reionization may be non--Gaussian because of feedback effects. Secondary
fluctuations on arc--minute scales provide an important probe of the efficiency
of rescattering.

Light element ($^6$Li, $^7$Li and $^9$Be) depletion isochrones for halo stars
have been calculated with standard stellar evolution models. These models
include the latest available opacities and are computed through the sub-giant
branch. If $^6$Li is not produced in appreciable amounts by stellar flares,
then the detection of $^6$Li in HD 84937 by Smith, Lambert \& Nissen (1993) is
compatible with standard stellar evolution and standard big bang
nucleosynthesis only if HD 84937 is a sub-giant. The present parallax is
inconsistent with HD 84937 being a sub-giant star at the $2.5\, \sigma$ level.
The most metal poor star with a measured $^9$Be abundance is HD 140283, which
is a relatively cool sub-giant. Standard stellar evolution predict that $^9$Be
will have been depleted in this star by $\sim 0.3$ dex (for ${\rm T_{eff}} =
5640$ K). Revising the abundance upward changes the oxygen-beryllium relation,
suggesting incompatible with standard comic ray production models, and hence,
standard big bang nucleosynthesis. However, an increase in the derived
temperature of HD 140283 to 5740 K would result in no depletion of $^9$Be and
agreement with standard big bang nucleosynthesis.

We present results for the two-point angular correlation function of galaxies
to a limiting magnitude of r=26. The final sample is 97% complete to r=26.0,
yielding 5730 galaxies over a 90.1 sq. arcmin field. The correlation function
for our faint galaxies can be parameterised by a power law, $A \theta^{-0.8}$,
in agreement with the clustering statistics of shallower catalogues. The
derived amplitude, $A$, is small, but non-zero. We combine this measurement
with the latest statistical constraints on faint galaxy redshifts from
gravitational lensing studies, which imply that the bulk of the r<26 field
galaxies should be at redshifts of order 1. Our derived $A$ is significantly
lower than that predicted from the local bright galaxy correlation function
using the lensing-determined galaxy redshift distribution and modest growth of
clustering. This simplistic model does not include the variation in observed
morphological mix as a function of redshift and apparent magnitude in our
sample. At our faintest limits we reach sufficiently high redshifts that
differential $K$ corrections will result in the observed galaxy mix being
dominated by star bursting dwarf and low surface brightness irregulars, rather
than the early-type systems used to define the local bright galaxy correlation
function. Adopting the correlation function measured locally for these low
surface brightness galaxies and assuming modest clustering evolution, we obtain
reasonable agreement between our model and observations. This model supports
the scenario in which the high number density of faint galaxies is produced by
normally clustered star forming dwarf galaxies at modest redshifts.

What is the role of clusters of galaxies in probing the large-scale velocity
field of the universe? We investigate the distribution of peculiar velocities
of clusters of galaxies in the popular low-density ($\Omega=0.3$) flat
Cold-Dark-Matter (CDM) cosmological model, which best fits many large-scale
structure observations. An $\Omega=1$ CDM model is also studied for comparison.
We find that clusters of galaxies are efficient tracers of the large-scale
velocity field. The clusters exhibit a Maxwellian distribution of peculiar
velocities, as expected from Gaussian initial density fluctuations. The cluster
3-D velocity distribution for the $\Omega=0.3$ model peaks at $v \sim 400$ km
s$^{-1}$, and extends to high velocities of $v \sim 1200$ km s$^{-1}$. The rms
peculiar velocity of the clusters is $440$ km s$^{-1}$. Approximately 10\% of
all model clusters move with high peculiar velocities of $v \ge 700$ km
s$^{-1}$. The observed velocity distribution of clusters of galaxies is
compared with the predictions from cosmological models. The observed data
exhibit a larger velocity tail than seen in the model simulations; however, due
to the large observational uncertainties, the data are consistent at a $\sim
3\sigma$ level with the model predictions, and with a Gaussian initial density
field. The large peculiar velocities reported for some clusters of galaxies ($v
\geq 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) are likely to be overestimated, if the current model is
viable.

The nonlinear evolution of matter clustering induces temperature anisotropies
in the cosmic microwave background. The fluctuations in temperature are
produced at a relatively low redshift, $z\simlt 10$, and consequently are not
affected by the uncertain reionization proccesses that occurred at earlier
epochs. The amplitude of the effect depends on the evolution model assumed for
galaxy clustering. For plausible parameter choices, the temperature
fluctuations are in the range $10^{-6}\simlt \Delta T/T \simlt 10^{-5}.$
Observed limits on $\Delta T/T $ would be violated if nonlinear clustering on
present cluster scales commenced prior to $z\sim 10.$

We show that gamma ray line emission at $\sim$0.4 MeV and $\lsim 0.2$ MeV can
be produced by Compton scattering of beamed radiation in the jets of Galactic
black hole candidates. This mechanism has the novel feature of not invoking the
presence of $e^+$--$e^-$ pairs. To produce the two lines we employ a symmetric
double sided jet with bulk flow velocity of about 0.5 c and incident beam
radiation with a hard energy spectrum. We show that the two lines can be seen
at viewing angle cosines relative to the jet ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. This
comprises 40\% of the total solid angle. In addition, the line radiation is
approximately 10\% polarized. Depending on the bulk flow and viewing angle the
model can produce lines at other energies as well. In particular a broad
feature near 1 MeV can be seen by viewing the jet close to its axis. Our model
can also accommodate single line spectra if the beamed gamma ray emission or
the jets themselves are asymmetric.

The $\ddot P$ (Backer 1992, Backer et al. 1993, Thorsett et al. 1993)
observed for PSR~B1620-26 in the globular cluster M4 is most likely due to
external gravitational jerk from a bound companion. Solving for the $\ddot P$
observed, constrained by the observed $\dot P$, two natural solutions are a
jovian mass in a $\gtorder 10 \ AU, e=0.3-0.5$ orbit, or a solar mass companion
in a $\sim 50 \ AU$ highly eccentric orbit (Michel 1994, Rasio 1994). If the
companion is solar mass, the system must be young, and its location outside the
cluster core is somewhat of a mystery. If the companion is planetary, it was
either exchanged with the secondary, or angular momentum transport in excretion
disks and planet formation is extraordinarily efficient. The implications for
planet formation around stellar systems are potentially profound.

Recent surveys of the blue straggler (BS) population in the galactic globular
cluster M3 (NGC 5272) give the first complete characterization of the number
density of BSs as a function of radius over an entire globular cluster. The BSs
in M3 are overabundant at large radii, and significantly underabundant at
intermediate radii. Here we present the result of a simulation of the dynamical
evolution of a population of BSs in a multi--mass model of M3. Assuming the BSs
were formed in the core through binary interactions (Hut \&\ Verbunt 1983,
Leonard 1989, Sigurdsson \&\ Phinney 1993, Hut \etal 1992, Davies, Benz and
Hills 1994), and given some very general assumptions about the recoil that
occurs during stellar mergers in interacting binaries; we find an excellent fit
to the observed radial distribution of BSs, suggesting strongly that most of
the BSs in M3 were formed through binary collisions in the core.

We investigate the effects of the observed UV background radiation on galaxy
formation. Photoionization by UV radiation decreases the cooling rate of the
gas in halos, so that objects with only large density contrasts can self-shield
against the background radiation, thereby allowing the shielded neutral cores
to cool and form stars. In the context of the CDM model, we use the criterion
that self-shielding is essential for star formation to calculate the mass
function of galaxies based on both Press-Schechter and the peaks formalisms.
The ionizing UV radiation results in the inhibition of galaxy formation --- we
show the decrease in the number density of the galaxies quantitatively. We also
find that the merging in general is made inefficient by the UV photons through
photoionization of the gas in the bigger system into which small objects are
incorporated. The latter means that, in a merging dominated region, where the
number density at the low-mass end ($M_b \la 10^{10}M_{\odot}$) is usually
expected to decrease with time, the trend is {\it reversed} (the number of
low-mass galaxies is more at lower redshifts $z$) due to the decreasing UV flux
with time after $z \sim 2$. We further discuss the implication of our results
for the number counts of galaxies and possible evolution of the luminosity
function of the galaxies.

A possible sound origin for the photospheric oscillations in the X--ray
bursting sources 1608-522 and 2127+119 is suggested. It is shown that standing
sound waves in an expanding spherical envelope can have periods very close to
the observed ones. The quite large ratio, $\sim$ 10, of the periods in the two
sources is explained in terms of different wave regimes. The relevance of sound
oscillations to the observed QPO in type II bursts of the Rapid Burster is also
discussed.

The recent discovery that faint gamma-ray bursts are stretched in time
relative to bright ones has been interpreted as support for cosmological
distances: faint bursts have their durations redshifted relative to bright
ones. It was pointed out, however, that the relative time stretching can also
be produced by an intrinsic correlation between duration and luminosity of
gamma-ray bursts in a nearby, bounded distribution. While both models can
explain the average amount of time stretching, we find a generic difference
between them in the way the duration distribution of faint bursts deviates from
that of bright ones. This allows us to distinguish between these two broad
classes of model on the basis of the duration distributions of gamma-ray
bursts, leading perhaps to an unambiguous determination of the distance scale
of gamma-ray bursts. We apply our proposed test to the second BATSE catalog and
conclude, with some caution, that the data favor a cosmological interpretation
of the time dilation.

The formation of galaxies in hierarchical cosmogonies is studied using high
resolution N-body plus SPH hydrodynamics simulations. The collapse of structure
is followed self-consistently from Mpc scale filamentary structures to kpc
scale galactic objects. The characteristics and formation processes of the
galaxy like objects are studied in detail, along with the aggregation into a
poor cluster. Related studies consider the effects of modelling star formation,
the reliability of tracing galaxies in simulations, and tests of SPH methods.

We present a new method for recovering the cosmological density, velocity,
and potential fields from all-sky redshift catalogues. The method is based on
an expansion of the fields in orthogonal radial (Bessel) and angular (spherical
harmonic) functions. In this coordinate system, peculiar velocities introduce a
coupling of the radial harmonics describing the density field in redshift space
but leave the angular modes unaffected. In the harmonic transform space, this
radial coupling is described by a distortion matrix which can be computed
analytically within the context of linear theory; the redshift space harmonics
can then be converted to their real space values by inversion of this matrix.
Statistical noise is mitigated by regularizing the matrix inversion with a
Wiener filter. The method yields a minimum variance estimate of the density
field in real space. In this coordinate system, the minimum variance harmonics
of the peculiar velocity and potential fields are related to those of the
density field by simple linear transformations. Tests of the method with
simulations of a CDM universe and comparison with previously proposed methods
demonstrate it to be a very promising new reconstruction method for the local
density and velocity field. A first application to the 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift
survey is presented.

The motivation and major ways for probing the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) are
reviewed. Galaxies hidden behind the ZOA may have important implications for
the internal dynamics of the Local Group, for the origin of its motion relative
to the Microwave Background, and for the connectivity of the large scale
structure. Current direct (`observational') methods for exploring the ZOA
include eye-balling of plates, source identification in the IRAS data base and
pointed and blind-search observations in 21 cm. Interesting regions identified
so far include the two crossing points of the Supergalactic Plane by the
Galactic Plane (at Galactic longitude $l \sim 135^o$, near Perseus-Pisces, and
$l \sim 315^o$, near the Great Attractor), the Puppis cluster (at $l \sim
240^o, cz \sim 1500$ km/sec) and the Ophiuchus cluster (at $l \sim 0^o, cz \sim
8400$ km/sec). New promising wavelengths are the $2 \mu$ and the X-ray band.
Indirect (`theoretical') approaches include `Wiener reconstruction' from
incomplete and noisy data, and using the peculiar velocity field as a probe of
the mass distribution hidden behind the ZOA. The problem of source confusion at
low Galactic latitude can be addressed by novel statistical methods, e.g.
Artificial Neural Networks.

A statistical method for reconstructing large scale structure behind the Zone
of Avoidance is presented. It also corrects for shot-noise and for redshift
distortion in galaxy surveys. The galaxy distribution is expanded in an
orthogonal set of spherical harmonics. We show that in the framework of
Bayesian statistics and Gaussian random fields the $4 \pi$ harmonics can be
recovered and the shot-noise can be suppressed, giving the optimal picture of
the underlying density field. The correction factor from observed to
reconstructed harmonics turns out to be the well-known Wiener filter (the ratio
of signal to signal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum
variance. We apply the method to the 1.2 Jy IRAS survey. A reconstruction of
the projected galaxy distribution confirms the connectivity of the
Supergalactic Plane across the Galactic Plane (at Galactic longitude $l \sim
135^o$ and $l \sim 315^o$) and the Puppis cluster behind the Galactic Plane ($
l \sim 240^o$). The method is extended to 3-D, and is used to recover from the
1.2 Jy redshift survey the density, velocity and potential fields in the local
universe.

We compare the burst distribution of the new (2B) BATSE catalogue to a
cosmological distribution. We find that the distribution is insensitive to
cosmological parameters such as Omega and Lambda and to the width of the bursts
luminosity function. The maximal red shift of the long bursts is ~2.1 (assuming
no evolution) while Zm(long) of the short bursts is significantly lower
Zm(short) =~ 0.5 In agreement with this relatively nearby origin of the short
burst we find an indication that these bursts are correlated ( >=2 sigma level
at 10 degrees) with Abell clusters. This is the first known correlation of the
bursts with any other astrophysical population and if confirmed by further
observations it will provides additional evidence for the cosmological origin
of those bursts.

This paper deals with the time evolution in the matter era of perturbations
in Friedman-Lemaitre models with arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$, with
either a zero cosmological constant, $\Lambda = 0$, or with a non-zero
cosmological constant in a spatially flat Universe. Unlike the classical
Eulerian approach where the density contrast is expanded in a perturbative
series, this analysis relies instead on a perturbative expansion of particles
trajectories in Lagrangian coordinates. This brings a number of advantages over
the classical analysis. In particular, it enables the description of stronger
density contrasts. Indeed the linear term is the famous Zel'dovich approximate
solution (1970). We present here a systematic and detailed account of this
approach. We give analytical results (or fits to numerical results) up to the
third order. We then proceed to explore the link between the lagrangian
description and statistical measures. We show in particular that Lagrangian
perturbation theory provides a natural framework to compute the effect of
redshift distortions, using the skewness of the density distribution function
as an example. Finally, we show how well the second order theory does as
compared to other approximat- ions in the case of spherically symmetric
perturbations. We also compare this second order approximation and Zel'dovich
solution to N-body simulations in the description of large-scale structure
formation starting from a power law (n=-2) power spectrum of Gaussian
perturbation. We find that second order theory is both simple and powerful.

The presence of non--Gaussian features in the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) radiation maps represents one of the most long--awaited clues in the
search for the actual structure of the primordial radiation, still needing
confirmation. These features could shed some light on the non trivial task of
distinguishing the real source of the primeval perturbations leading to large
scale structure. One of the simplest non--Gaussian signals to search is the
(dimensionless) skewness ${\cal S}$. Explicit computations for ${\cal S}$ are
presented in the frame of physically motivated inflationary models (natural,
intermediate and polynomial potential inflation) in the hope of finding values
in agreement with estimated quantities from large angle scale (e.g., {\em COBE}
DMR) maps. In all the cases considered the non--Gaussian effects turn out to
lie below the level of theoretical uncertainty (cosmic variance). The
possibility of unveiling the signal for ${\cal S}$ with multiple--field models
is also discussed.

Kinematics and photometry of the polar ring galaxy NGC 4650A, including new
observations of the rotation and velocity dispersion of its central stellar
disk, are used to infer the presence of a dark matter halo and to measure its
shape. Fits to the observed disk and polar ring rotation curves from detailed
mass and photometric modeling rule out a spherical dark halo. The best fit
models have halos with isodensity surfaces that are flattened to a shape
between E6 and E7 (axis ratios between 0.4 and 0.3); the asymptotic equatorial
speeds of these models are in excellent agreement with the I-band Tully-Fisher
relation. This degree of dark halo flattening is larger than that expected from
N-body collapse simulations of dissipationless dark matter. Since the
kinematics and surface brightness profile of the central luminous body indicate
that its light has an intrinsic axis ratio $c/a \lsim 0.4$, in NGC 4650A the
radial ``conspiracy" between the dark and luminous components that leads to
flat rotation curves may extend to the {\it shape} of the mass distribution as
well.

We present a new formalism which allows to derive the general Lagrangian
dynamical equations for the motion of gravitating particles in a non--flat
Friedmann universe with arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$ and no
cosmological constant. We treat the set of particles as a Newtonian
collisionless fluid. The non--linear dynamical evolution of the fluid element
trajectories is then described up to the third--order expansion in Lagrangian
coordinates. This work generalizes recent investigations carried out by Bouchet
\etal (1992) and Buchert (1994).

We present intermediate dispersion (0.7-2.2 \AA ~pix$^{-1}$) optical
spectroscopic observations aimed at applying the ``Lithium Test'' to a sample
of ten brown dwarf candidates located in the general field, two in young open
clusters, and two in close binaries. We find evidence for strong Li depletion
in all of them, and thus infer lower mass limits of 0.065~M$_\odot$, depending
only slightly ($\pm$0.005~M$_\odot$) on the interior models. None of the field
brown dwarf candidates in our sample appears to be a very young (age
$<$~10$^8$~yr) substellar object. For one of the faintest proper motion
Pleiades members known (V=20.7) the Li test implies a mass greater than
$\sim$0.08~M$_\odot$, and therefore it is not a brown dwarf. From our spectra
we estimate spectral types for some objects and present measurements of Halpha
emission strengths and radial velocities. Finally, we compare the positions in
the H-R diagram of our sample of brown dwarf candidates with the theoretical
region where Li is expected to be preserved (Substellar Lithium Region). We
find that certain combinations of temperature calibrations and evolutionary
tracks are consistent with the constraints imposed by the observed Li depletion
in brown dwarf candidates, while others are not.

High resolution CASPEC and EMMI spectra (R$\approx$10$^4$) of the faint
metal- deficient candidates CS 22891--209, CS 22897--8, CS 22948--66 and CS
22968--14 taken from the survey of Beers, Preston and Shectman (1985, BPS) are
analyzed for abundances. The fine analysis with LTE model atmospheres gives an
iron metallicity for the four stars between $-$3.15 and $-$3.45 in good
agreement with the abundances inferred from CaII K index by Beers et al.
(1992). These four objects considerably augment the number of spectroscopically
studied stars at the low metallicity extreme. We found the $\alpha$-elements
Mg, Ca, Si, and Ti enhanced, and the iron-peak elements Sc, Mn and Cr tracking
closely iron with the typical pattern of the more metallic halo stars. Aluminum
results deficient with respect both to iron and to magnesium showing a strong
{\it odd-even\/} effect, but for [Fe/H] $\leq$ $-$3.0 [Al/Mg] levels out into a
plateau around $-$1.0, showing a primary behaviour. [Na/Fe] is $\approx$ $-$0.2
and only compared to magnesium it shows a mild odd-even effect. The heavy
elements Sr and Ba show a large scatter which is not observed for other
elements and cannot be due to observational errors only. In the case of CS
22891--209 they are particularly overabundant with [Sr,Ba/Fe] $\approx$ 0.9.
The spread might reflect the presence of strong inhomogeneities in the
interstellar gas at the earliest stages of Galaxy formation. This might be an
important signature of the still elusive processes of the early formation of
these elements observed in old stars.

We show that faint red stars do not contribute significantly to the mass
budget of the Galaxy or to microlensing statistics. Our results are obtained by
analyzing two long exposures of a high-latitude field taken with the Wide Field
Camera on the newly repaired {\it Hubble Space Telescope}. Stars are easily
distinguished from galaxies essentially to the limiting magnitudes of the
images. We find five stars with $2.0<V-I<3.0$ and $I<25.3$ and no stars with
$V-I>3.0$. Therefore, main-sequence stars with $M_I>10$ that are above the
hydrogen-burning limit in the dark halo or the spheroid contribute $<6%$ of the
unseen matter. Faint red disk stars, M-dwarfs, contribute at most $ 15%$ to the
mass of the disk. We parameterize the faint end of the cumulative distribution
of stars, $\Phi$, as a function of luminosity $L_V$, $d\Phi/d \ln L_V \propto
L_V^{-\gamma}$. For spheroid stars, $\gamma<0.32$ over the range $6<M_V<17$,
with 98% confidence. The disk luminosity function falls, $\gamma<0$, for
$15\lsim M_V\lsim 19$. Faint red stars in the disk or thick disk, and stars
with $M_V<16$ in the spheroid contribute $\tau< 10^{-8}$ to the optical depth
to microlensing toward the Large Magellanic Cloud.

The computer animation illustrates the geometries described in a paper by the
same authors. The preprint is available as number 9401045. The opening scene
shows dipole field lines emanating from the polar caps of a rotating neutron
star. The dipole axis is inclined along the green rods. The field lines shown
are defined from the condition that they be tangent to the light cylinder (the
cylindrical radius at which the tangential velocity of rotation reaches the
speed of light). The static dipole field lines are smoothly morphed into the
correct retarted-potential vacuum solutions. A red surface spanning these field
lines is painted. In the next scene the blue surfaces represent the outer gaps
above the surface of last closed field lines. High energy emission (blue) is
produced in these outer gaps, and is beamed tangentially along the field lines.
The radio emission (green) originates close to the surface of the star and is
beamed along the dipole axes. The inclination angle $\alpha$ of the dipole and
the viewing angle $\zeta$ are chosen to match the Crab parameters; $\alpha$ =
70, $\zeta$ = 65. The corresponding light curve is computed and shown for these
angles, and the red dot traces rotation phase. The next scene shows the
situation for angles appropriate to PSR1706-44; $\alpha$ = 45, $\zeta$ = 65.
The final scene is a possibility for Geminga; $\alpha$ = 20, $\zeta$ = 75.
These angles are poorly constrained as there is no radio emission.

A simple analytic calculation is presented for the secular evolution of the
eccentricities in a hierarchical triple system such as the one containing the
millisecond pulsar PSR 1620-26 in M4. If the second companion of PSR 1620-26 is
of stellar mass ($m_2\ga0.1\,M_\odot$), an eccentricity as large as that
observed today for the inner binary ($e_1\simeq0.03$) could very well have been
induced by secular perturbations. In contrast, such a large eccentricity cannot
be induced by a second companion of planetary mass.

Using an extensive sample of nearby galaxies (the Nearby Galaxies Catalog, by
Tully), we investigate the environment of the galaxies hosting low-luminosity
AGNs (Seyferts and LINERs). We define the local galaxy density, adopting a new
correction for the incompleteness of the galaxy sample at large distances. We
consider both a complete sample of bright and nearby AGNs, identified from the
nuclear spectra obtained in available wide optical spectroscopic surveys, and a
complete sample of nearby Seyferts. Basically, we compare the local galaxy
density distributions of the AGNs with those of non-AGN samples, chosen in
order to match the magnitude and morphological type distributions of the AGN
samples. We find, only for the early-type spirals more luminous than $\sim
M^*$, that both LINERs and Seyferts tend to reside in denser environments on
all the scales tested, from tenths of Mpc to a few Mpc; moreover Seyferts show
an enhanced small-scale density segregation with respect to LINERs. This gives
support to the idea that AGNs can be stimulated by interactions. On larger
scales, tens of Mpc, we find that the AGNs hosted in luminous early-type
spirals show a tendency to stay near the center of the Local Supercluster.
Finally we discuss the interpretations of our findings and their consequences
for some possible scenarios of AGN formation and evolution and for the problem
of how AGNs trace the large-scale structures.

Fireballs are an essential part of any cosmological $\gamma$-ray burst. We
drive here a stability criterion for fireballs and show that fireballs are
Rayleigh-Taylor unstable in any region in which the entropy decreases outward.
The instability begins to operate when the fireball becomes matter dominated.
Among the possible implication of the instability are: (i) Conversion of a
fraction of the radiation energy to a convective energy expressed in the motion
of bubbles relative to each other. (ii) Penetration of fast bubbles through
slower ones and creation of high $\gamma$ regimes which are essential for
efficient conversion of the energy to $\gamma$-rays. (iii) Formation of rapid
variation (of the scale of the bubbles) in the observed $\gamma$-rays.

Galactic open clusters provide an abundant sample of stellar aggregates of
various sizes, ages and metal abundances, apt to constitute a template for
comparison with star systems in other galaxies. In this paper we present and
discuss a standard methodology to synthesize {\sl U,B,V} fluxes and colours,
and apply it to a set of 138 open clusters. Results are compared with previous
available ones in the literature. We were able to calibrate a mass--luminosity
relation by which we evaluated the mass of $\simeq 400$ open clusters, leading
to a well defined present--day mass function. The number--complete sample of
galactic open clusters presented in Battinelli \& Capuzzo--Dolcetta (1991) is
enlarged of a $15\%$.}

We investigate the dependence of large angular scale cosmic microwave
background anisotropies on various initial conditions, including both adiabatic
and isocurvature perturbations and the initial power law index $n$, in a
variety of low-$\Omega$ cosmological models. Cosmological constant- dominated
flat models and inflationary open adiabatic models, with $n_{\rm eff}<1$, and
open isocurvature models, with $n_{\rm eff} \simeq 2$, are significantly
constrained by the present observations.

We present a new automatic technique based on Principal Component Analysis
and Cluster Analysis, with the aim of its application to the identification of
those clumps in unresolved galaxies which likely represent regions of star
formation. We test the method by applying it to the galaxy M~31, for which
there are already several sets of identifications of OB associations based on
multi--colour images of resolved stars. We use small--scale digital images of
M~31 and compare the associations that we detect from these unresolved data
with previously--published large--scale data, finding a rather good agreement.
We obtain a strict agreement of our identification with the most compact
associations of the original van den Bergh (1964) identification. We then apply
the technique to CCD images of the more distant spiral galaxy NGC~2903 and
identify 68 OB association candidates.

Non-spherical dynamical approximations and models for the gravitational
collapse are used to extend the well-known Press \& Schechter (PS) approach, in
order to determine analytical expressions for the mass function of cosmic
structures. The problem is rigorously set up by considering the intrinsic
Lagrangian nature of the mass function. The Lagrangian equations of motion of a
cold and irrotational fluid in single-stream regime show that the shear, which
is non-locally determined by all the matter field, is the quantity which
characterizes non-spherical perturbations. The Zel'dovich approximation, being
a self-consistent first-order Lagrangian and local one, is used as a suitable
guide to develop realistic estimates of the collapse time of a mass clump,
starting from the local initial values of density and shear. Both
Zel'dovich-based \an\ and models and the homogeneous ellipsoidal model predict
that more large-mass objects are expected to form than the usual PS relation.
In particular, the homogeneous ellipsoid model is consistent at large masses
with a Press \& Schechter mass function with a lower value of the \dc\
parameter, in the range 1.4$\div$1.6. This gives a dynamical explanation of why
lower \dc\ values have been found to fit the results of several N-body
simulations. When more small-scale structure is present, highly non-linear
dynamical effects can effectively slow down the collapse rate of a
perturbation, increasing the effective value of \dc. This may have interesting
consequences on the abundance of large-mass high-redshift objects.

The central mass distribution of clusters of galaxies can be inferred from
gravitationally lensed arcs with known redshifts. For the Abell cluster 2218,
this method yields a core mass which is larger by a factor of $2.5 \pm 0.5$
than the value deduced from X-ray observations, under the assumptions that the
gas is supported by thermal pressure and that the cluster is spherical. We show
that a non-thermal pressure support is the most plausible explanation for this
discrepancy. Such a pressure can be naturally provided by strong turbulence and
equipartition magnetic fields ($\sim 50\mu$G) that are tangled on small spatial
scales (<10 kpc). The turbulent and magnetic pressures do not affect the
measured Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for this cluster. Intracluster magnetic
fields with a comparable magnitude ($\sim 10^{1-2} \mu$G) have already been
detected by Faraday rotation in other clusters. If generic, a small-scale
equipartition magnetic field should affect the structure of cooling flows and
must be included in X-ray determinations of cluster masses.

(To appear in the Astrophysical Journal) Holdom and Malaney (1994) have
suggested a mechanism for gamma-ray bursts which requires that stars be
captured by a neutrino ball. Neutrino balls would be, for the most part, denser
than main sequence stars, but their density would decrease as their mass
increased. We show that small neutrino balls would subject stars to tidal
forces sufficient to disrupt them. We thus argue that if neutrino balls existed
at the centres of galaxies, only the largest would be able to act as a source
of gamma-ray bursts. Such neutrino balls would have a mass of order
$10^7\Msun$. Tidal capture of stars by a neutrino ball would not be important,
but dynamical friction against the neutrinos or star-disc interactions could
both be important capture mechanisms. We find that a gamma-ray burst would
occur in a galaxy containing such a neutrino ball roughly every $10^2\y$, and
the fraction of all galaxies contributing to the gamma-ray burst flux would be
$\sim 10^{-4}$, assuming that this was the mechanism of all gamma-ray bursts.
These numbers have implications for neutrino ball models of active galaxies,
assuming that all gamma-ray bursts and all AGN come from neutrino balls. Either
a small fraction $\sim 10^{-2}$ of the lifetime of such an object could be
spent as an AGN, or that the probability of a neutrino ball becoming an AGN
would be $10^{-2}$. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that
neutrino balls might exist at the centres of galaxies through direct
ground-based observation of stellar kinematics.

We present a new numerical study of the equilibrium and stability properties
of close binary systems using the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
technique. We adopt a simple polytropic equation of state $p=K\rho^\gam$ with
$\gam=5/3$ and $K=\,$constant within each star, applicable to low-mass
degenerate dwarfs as well as low-mass main-sequence stars. Along a sequence of
binary equilibrium configurations for two identical stars, we demonstrate the
existence of both secular and dynamical instabilities, confirming directly the
results of recent analytic work. We use the SPH method to calculate the
nonlinear development of the dynamical instability and to determine the final
fate of the system. We find that the two stars merge together into a single,
rapidly rotating object in just a few orbital periods. Equilibrium sequences
are also constructed for systems containing two nonidentical stars. These
sequences terminate at a Roche limit, which we can determine very accurately
using SPH. For two low-mass main-sequence stars with mass ratio $q\lo0.4$ we
find that the (synchronized) Roche limit configuration is secularly unstable.
Degenerate binary configurations remain hydrodynamically stable all the way to
the Roche limit for all mass ratios $q\ne1$. Dynamically unstable mass transfer
can also lead to the rapid coalescence of a binary system, but the details of
the hydrodynamic evolution are quite different. We discuss the implications of
our results for double white-dwarf and W Ursae Majoris systems.

About two years ago, Wolszczan and Frail announced the detection of a
possible planetary system consisting of two Earth-mass planets around a
millisecond pulsar. It was pointed out shortly thereafter that the mutual
gravitational interaction of the planets leads to predictable evolution of
their orbits. Because millisecond pulsars are very stable ``clocks'' and allow
pulse timing measurements with microsecond precision, the orbit evolution would
lead to a measurable modulation of the arrival times of the pulses. Detection
of this effect would serve to corroborate the planetary interpretation of the
data and provide additional constraints on the system. The theory of planetary
perturbations in the context of pulsar timing observations is summarized here.

The degree of complexity and, to a somewhat lesser degree, realism in
simulations has advanced rapidly in the past few years. The simplest approach -
modeling a cluster as collisionless dark matter and collisonal, non--radiative
gas is now fairly well established. One of the most fruitful results of this
approach is the {\sl morphology--cosmology connection} for X-ray clusters.
Simulations have provided the means to make concrete predictions for the X-ray
morphologies of clusters in cosmologies with different $\Omega_o$, with the
result that low $\Omega_o$ cosmologies fair rather poorly when compared to
observations. Another result concerns the accuracy of \xray binding mass
estimates. The standard, hydrostatic, isothermal model estimator is found to be
accurate to typically better than $50\%$ at radii where the density contrast is
between $10^2$ and $10^3$. More complicated approaches, which attempt to
explicitly follow galaxy formation within the proto--cluster environment are
slowly being realized. The key issue of {\sl dynamical biasing} of the galaxy
population within a cluster is being probed, but conclusive answers are
lacking. The dynamics of multi--phase gas, including conversion of cold, dense
gas into stars and the feedback therefrom, is the largest obstacle hindering
progress. An example demonstrating the state--of--the--art in this area is
presented.

We study the evolution of viscous, isothermal, rotating, thin, axisymmetric
accretion disks around a compact object using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.
We emphasize the effects of different choices of viscosity prescriptions on the
evolution of angular momentum as well as other physical quantities of the disk.
We show that a flow with the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity prescription may produce
only {\it shear} shock, where the angular momentum changes significantly across
the shock. We present and study the effects of other prescriptions of viscosity
which render the angular momentum continuous across the shock waves. In
general, it is observed that for flows with a small viscosity, the shocks are
weaker, form farther away and are wider as compared to the shocks in inviscid
flows. If the viscosity is high, shocks do not form at all. The flow remains
subsonic and Keplerian throughout the disk and becomes supersonic only very
close to the horizon.

The mass derived from gravitational lensing reflects the total mass contained
in the lensing system, independent of the specific matter contents and states.
A comparison of the dynamical masses from hydrostatic equilibrium with the
gravitational masses from arc-like images of background galaxies is made for
four clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshits. It is found that virial
analysis has underestimated the total cluster masses (from lensing) by a factor
of $3\sim6$ within a radius of $\sim0.3$ Mpc $h_{50}^{-1}$ around the cluster
centers, indicating that clusters of galaxies might not be regarded as the well
relaxed virialized systems. The increase of the total cluster masses obtained
from lensing leads to the decrease of the baryon fractions of clusters of
galaxies, which provides a crue for solving the ``$\Omega_0$ disprepancy
puzzle" in cosmology.

We present here new VLBI observations of one FR-I radio galaxy (NGC2484) and
two Broad Line FR-II radio galaxies (3C109 and 3C382). For 3C109 new VLA maps
are also shown. These sources belong to a complete sample of radio galaxies
under study for a better knowledge of their structures at parsec resolution.
The parsec structure of these 3 objects is very similar: asymmetric emission
which we interpret as the core plus a one-sided jet. The parsec scale jet is
always on the same side of the main kpc-scale jet. The limit on the jet to
counterjet brightness ratio, the ratio of the core radio power to the total
radio power and the Synchrotron-self Compton model allow us to derive some
constraints on the jet velocity and orientation with respect to the line of
sight. From these data and from those published on 2 other sources of our
sample, we suggest that parsec scale jets are relativistic in both FR-I and
FR-II radio galaxies and that pc scale properties in FR-I and FR-II radio
galaxies are very similar despite of the large difference between these two
classes of radio galaxies on the kpc scale.

Lauer \& Postman (LP) observe that all Abell clusters with redshifts less
than 15,000\kms\ appear to be participating in a bulk flow of 689 km s$^{-1}$
with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find this result difficult
to reconcile with all popular models for large-scale structure formation that
assume Gaussian initial conditions. This conclusion is based on Monte-Carlo
realizations of the LP data, drawn from large Particle-Mesh $N$-body
simulations.
  We have taken special care to treat properly the longest-wavelength
components of the power spectra. Bulk flows with amplitude as large as that
reported by LP are not uncommon in the Monte-Carlo datasets. However, the
$\chi^2$ of the observed bulk flow, taking into account the anisotropy of the
error ellipsoid, is much more difficult to match in the simulations. The models
examined are ruled out at confidence levels between 94\% and 98\%. Any model
that has {\it intrinsic} flows of less than 480\kms\ on the scales probed by LP
scales can be ruled out at a similar level.

Predicted rates for solar neutrino experiments that are obtained with a
modified stellar evolution code originally developed to study the advanced
stages of stellar evolution are shown to be in agreement with other
recently-calculated precise solar models to about 2% (0.2 SNU for the chlorine
experiment). Different scenarios for pre-main sequence evolution are explored
and are found to change the predicted rates for solar neutrino experiments by
less than or of order 1%. The influence of the depth of the solar convective
zone on the predicted solar neutrino fluxes is established by direct
calculation. It is shown that a change in the calculated depth of the
convective zone that is five times larger than the quoted helioseismological
measurement uncertainty determined by Christensen-Dalsgaard, Gough, & Thompson
causes a change in the predicted $^8$B neutrino flux of less than 7% and a
change in the $^7$Be neutrino flux of less than 4%. Additionally, it is shown
that the radiative opacities near the depth of the convective zone cannot
differ from the standard OPAL values by more than about 12% without causing the
calculated and measured depths of the convective zone to differ by more than
five times the helioseismological measurement uncertainty.

Four microlensing collaborations are presently searching for compact matter
in the Galaxy and all have detected possible candidates. Using the detection
efficiencies recently published by the MACHO and OGLE collaborations, we
present Monte-Carlo calculations of the expected optical depth, rates and
timescales, along the LMC and Galactic bulge lines of sight, for dark matter in
a four-component `standard Galaxy' model with a spherically-symmetric halo and
spheroid. Using the typically observed event durations we show that, whilst the
halo fraction comprised of compact matter is likely to be $f_{h} < 0.4$, a `no
halo compact matter' hypothesis is ruled out at greater than the 80\%
confidence level, unless the LMC itself has a substantial halo of such objects.
On the basis of the timescales observed by OGLE towards the bulge we find the
rate predicted by the model to be in good agreement with the number of OGLE
detections. We compute lens mass probability distributions for the various
components and compare these estimates with current observational and
theoretical constraints on the mass scale of baryonic dark matter. We assess
the uniformity of the amplification distributions for the published EROS, MACHO
and OGLE events and find that they are quite consistent with the microlensing
hypothesis, although the OGLE candidate selection criteria mean that its data
are particularly sensitive to photometric selection effects. The EROS team has
recently placed strong limits on the density contribution of very low mass halo
objects from their short timescale CCD search. On the basis of a recent study
of the flux amplification of finite-size sources by Simmons, Newsam \& Willis
\shortcite{simm95} we suggest that EROS may have detected up to 5
low-amplification events due to halo lenses with mass $m\sim 10^{-7}~\sm$.

We describe a method for the numerical solution of the relativistic Euler
equations which we have found to be both robust and efficient, and which has
enabled us to simulate relativistic jets. The technique employs a solver of the
Godunov-type, with approximate solution of the local Riemann problems, applied
to laboratory frame variables. Lorentz transformations provide the rest frame
quantities needed for the estimation of wave speeds, etc. This is applied
within the framework of an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, allowing us to
perform high-resolution, 2-D simulations with modest computing resources. We
present the results of nonrelativistic, and relativistic ($\gamma=5$ and $10$)
runs, for adiabatic indices of $5/3$ and $4/3$. We find the same gross
morphology in all cases, but the relativistic runs exhibit little instability
and less well-defined structure internal to the jet: this might explain the
difference between (relatively slow) BL~Lacs and (faster) QSOs. We find that
the choice of adiabatic index makes a small but discernible difference to the
structure of the shocked jet and ambient media.

Femtolensing is a gravitational lensing effect in which the magnification is
a function not only of the positions and sizes of the source and lens, but also
of the wavelength of light. Femtolensing is the only known effect of
$(10^{-13}-10^{-16} M_{\sun})$ dark-matter objects and may possibly be
detectable in cosmological gamma-ray burst spectra. We present a new and
efficient algorithm for femtolensing calculations in general potentials. The
physical-optics results presented here differ at low frequencies from the
semi-classical approximation, in which the flux is attributed to a finite
number of mutually coherent images. At higher frequencies, our results agree
well with the semi-classical predictions. Applying our method to a point-mass
lens with external shear, we find complex events that have structure at both
large and small spectral resolution. In this way, we show that femtolensing may
be observable for lenses up to $10^{-11}$ solar masses, much larger than
previously believed. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of a search for
femtolensing of white dwarfs in the LMC at optical wavelengths.

cosmology: 1) groups are tidally destroyed by the tidal field of the cluster
they fall into; 2) spherical infall leads to the young cosmo-dynamical state of
loose groups, a fundamental surface for groups, $\Omega_0 \simeq 0.3$, and the
mixed nature of compact groups (virialized groups, groups at full collapse, and
chance alignments within collapsing loose groups, for decreasing compact group
velocity dispersion) ; 3) X-ray analyses lead to $\Omega_0 \lta 0.5$.

We have incorporated star formation algorithms into a hybrid N-body/smoothed
particle hydrodynamics code (TREESPH) in order to describe the star forming
properties of disk galaxies over timescales of a few billion years. The models
employ a Schmidt law of index $n\sim 1.5$ to calculate star formation rates,
and explicitly include the energy and metallicity feedback into the ISM.
Modeling the newly formed stellar population is achieved through the use of
hybrid SPH/young star particles which gradually convert from gaseous to
collisionless particles, avoiding the computational difficulties involved in
creating new particles. The models are shown to reproduce well the star forming
properties of disk galaxies, such as the morphology, rate of star formation,
and evolution of the global star formation rate and disk gas content. As an
example of the technique, we model an encounter between a disk galaxy and a
small companion which gives rise to a ring galaxy reminiscent of the Cartwheel
(AM 0035-35). The primary galaxy in this encounter experiences two phases of
star forming activity: an initial period during the expansion of the ring, and
a delayed phase as shocked material in the ring falls back into the central
regions.

This is an old article which has never been posted for public use and which
only appeard in a relatively hard-to-get Proceedings of the Sakharov Conference
in Moscow (May, 1991). The subject of this article has received a lot of
attention in last two years. Although we acknowledge that there has been a very
big progress in the field of relating the spectrum of fluctuations to scalar
field potentials of inflation models, which have outdated some of our results
(particularly because we never took into account the tensor fluctuations which
have been shown to be crucial for reconstructing the inflaton potential) we
think that some of the other ideas and approaches which we presented in this
article maybe still of interest. We did not rewrite the article to include any
of the newer approaches and we did not add any of the newer references. The
reader is advised to refer to recent papers (for example, see the paper
astro-ph/9403001 by Edward Kolb and Sharon Vadas) for state of the art review
and up-to-date references.
  ==The original abstract of the article==: We prove that, in stochastic
approach, there exists an equivalence relation between different inflationary
models under some redefinition of field and time variables. The
postinflationary physics is insensitive to it and one can say that related
theories are in fact indistinguishable from the viewpoint

Motivated by recent observation of Lanzetta et al. that most luminous
galaxies at low redshifts produce $\lya$ absorption at impact parameter $l\lsim
160 \kpch$, we propose that these absorbers are clouds confined by the pressure
of ambient hot gas in galactic haloes. We determine the properties of this hot
gas and of the absorption systems on the basis of observational and theoretical
constraints. The absorbing clouds need to be replenished on about one orbital
time ($\sim 10^9$ yrs) in the galactic halo. The pressure and temperature of
the gas at radius $r\sim 100\kpc$ are $P=(10-100){\rm cm^{-3} K}$,
$T=10^{(5.5-6.5)}{\rm K}$. The model requires that about 10 per cent of the gas
in low-redshift galactic haloes is in the hot phase. Such gas in galactic
haloes emits x-ray with bolometric luminosity of the order $10^{37-40}{\rm
erg\,s^{-1}}$. The plausibility for such gas to exist in current models of
galaxy formation is discussed.

This is the first in a series of papers describing the {\it Optical Redshift
Survey} (ORS), a redshift survey of optically selected galaxies covering 98\%
of the sky above $|b| = 20^\circ$ (8.09 ster). The survey is drawn from the
UGC, ESO, and ESGC galaxy catalogues, and contains two sub-samples, one
complete to a $B$ magnitude of 14.5, the other complete to a $B$ major axis
diameter of $1.9^\prime$. The entire sample consists of 8457 objects, of which
redshifts are now available for 8286; 171 objects remain without measured
redshifts. The ORS provides the most detailed and homogeneous sampling of the
large-scale galaxy distribution to date in these areas. The density field of
bright optical galaxies is well-defined to $8000 \kms$, and is dominated by the
Virgo, Telescopium-Pavo-Indus, Hydra-Centaurus, Pisces-Perseus, and Coma-A1367
Superclusters. The dense sampling provided by ORS allows a detailed analysis of
the galaxy density field, and will be used to test its dependence on morphology
and other galaxy parameters.

We present a simple, yet accurate approximation for calculating the cosmic
microwave background anisotropy power spectrum in adiabatic models. It consists
of solving for the evolution of a two-fluid model until the epoch of
recombination and then integrating over the sources to obtain the CMB
anisotropy power spectrum. The approximation is useful both for a physical
understanding of CMB anisotropies, as well as for a quantitative analysis of
cosmological models. Comparison with exact calculations shows that the accuracy
is typically better than 20 percent over a large range of angles and
cosmological models, including those with curvature and cosmological constant.
Using this approximation we investigate the dependence of the CMB anisotropies
on the cosmological parameters. We identify six dimensionless parameters that
uniquely determine the anisotropy power spectrum within our approximation. CMB
experiments on different angular scales could in principle provide information
on all these parameters. In particular, mapping of the Doppler peaks would
allow an independent determination of baryon mass density, matter mass density
and Hubble constant.

The deflection angle $\Delta\phi$ of light rays by the gravitational field of
a spherical system $M(r)$ is calculated using the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND). It is shown that $\Delta\phi$ with an impact parameter $r_0$ can be
expressed by the measured rotation velocity $v(r)$ as
  $\Delta\phi(r_0)=2\int_{r_0}^{\infty}
  \frac{v^2(r)}{c^2}\frac{r_0dr}{r\sqrt{r^2-r_0^2}}$, where
  $v(r)=\left\{\left(Ga_0M(r)\right)^{1/4}, &
  r_0>r_c;\left(\frac{GM(r)}{r}\right)^{1/2},& r_0\leq r_c,\right$,
  and $r_c$ is the critical radius that is determined by the critical
acceleration $a_0$. In the Newtonian limit of the gravitational acceleration
$a\gg a_0$, $\Delta\phi$ approaches $\Delta\phi=2Gm(r_0)/c^2r_0$ with the
projected surface mass $m(r_0)$. Whilst the asymptotic value of $\Delta\phi$
reaches a constant $\pi(v_{\infty}/c)^2$ in the low-acceleration limit of $a\ll
a_0$.
  Taking the empirical correction of a factor of 2 from the theory of general
relativity into account and utilizing the relation between rotation velocity
$v$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma$, MOND results naturally in a constant
deflection angle, $4\pi(\sigma/c)^2$, which has been widely used in the
present-day study of gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters of
galaxies, implying that without introducing the massive halos acting as
$r^{-2}$ for dark matter MOND has no difficulty in reproducing the known cases
of gravitational lensing associated with galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

We present a new method for measuring the projected mass distributions of
galaxy clusters. The gravitational amplification is measured by comparing the
joint distribution in redshift and magnitude of galaxies behind the cluster
with that of field galaxies. We show that the total amplification is directly
related to the surface mass density in the weak field limit, and so it is
possible to map the mass distribution of the cluster. The method is shown to be
limited by discreteness noise and galaxy clustering behind the lens. Galaxy
clustering sets a lower limit to the error along the redshift direction, but a
clustering independent lensing signature may be obtained from the magnitude
distribution at fixed redshift. Statistical techniques are developed for
estimating the surface mass density of the cluster. We extend these methods to
account for any obscuration by cluster halo dust, which may be mapped
independently of the dark matter. We apply the method to a series of numerical
simulations and show the feasibility of the approach. We consider approximate
redshift information, and show how the mass estimates are degraded.

We present a new formulation of the equations of motion used in smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The spatial resolution in SPH is determined by
the smoothing length, $h$, and it has become common practice for each particle
to be given its own adaptive smoothing length, $h_i$. Consequently, the dynamic
range that may be spatially resolved is greatly increased, but additional
($\nabla h$) terms, which account for the variability of the smoothing lengths,
should appear in the equations of motion in order to satisy conservation
requirements. Previous implementations of SPH have neglected these additional
terms, whereas we have included them. This is achieved by defining a functional
form for the $h_i$s, that depends on inter-particle distances only, and then
deriving the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian formalism. A number of
test calculations are presented. We find that including the $\nabla h$ terms
has no detrimental effect on the ability of SPH to model known problems with
reasonable accuracy. For problems where the energy conservation was rather
poor, including the $\nabla h$ terms results in a dramatic improvement. In
particluar non-conservation of energy during a collision between two polytropes
can occur at the level of 10% when the $\nabla h$ terms are neglected. When the
$\nabla h$ terms are included, then this error reduces to 0.8%.

The radio and X-ray observations of SN 1993J during the first year can be
consistently explained as a result of interaction of the expanding ejecta with
a circumstellar medium. The density of the circumstellar gas can be deduced
from the free-free absorption of the radio emission and from the X-ray
luminosity. During the first two weeks, both sets of observations indicate a
mass loss rate of $\sim 4\EE{-5} \Msun ~\rm yr^{-1}$ for a wind velocity of $10
\kms$. The subsequent radio and X-ray observations indicate a density gradient
$\propto r^{-s}$, with $1.5 \lsim s \lsim 1.7$, as opposed to the $r^{-2}$
gradient expected for a steady, spherically symmetric wind. This may either be
caused by a variation of the mass loss rate from the progenitor system, or by a
non-spherically symmetric geometry. To explain the properties of the X-ray
emission, a steep density gradient in the ejecta is needed. During the first
months most of the observed X-ray emission originates from the circumstellar
shock, which is adiabatic, while the reverse shock is radiative. To avoid
excessive Comptonization in the X-ray range collisionless heating must be
ineffective. The soft X-rays observed at 220 days probably originate from the
reverse shock. The ionization and temperature structures of the circumstellar
gas are calculated; we find that the temperature is in excess of $10^5 \rm~K$
and the medium is nearly completely ionized by the shock radiation after the
formation of the shocks. Preacceleration of the circumstellar gas by the
radiation from the outbreak can explain

We present a new complete set of Lagrangian relativistic hydrodynamical
equations describing the transfer of energy and momentum between a standard
fluid and a radiation fluid in a general non-stationary spherical flow. The new
set of equations has been derived for a particular application to the study of
the cosmological Quark--Hadron transition but can also be used in other
contexts.

We report the successful development and operation of a large astronomical
liquid-mirror telescope. Employing a rotating 2.7-meter diameter mirror with a
surface of liquid mercury, the telescope images a half-degree diameter field
centered at the zenith. Located near Vancouver, British Columbia, it is
equipped with a low-noise 2048x2048-pixel CCD detector, operating in TDI mode,
which produces continuous imaging of a 20 arcminute-widestrip of sky with 2
minute integration time. Images with FWHM of 2 arcseconds or less are regularly
obtained. This image quality is limited only by atmospheric seeing and
star-trail curvature. The telescope is equipped with a series of narrow-band
filters, designed to produce 40-point spectral energy distributions from 0.4 to
1.0 microns of all detected objects. These will allow classification and
redshift estimation of approximately 25,000 galaxies and 1,000 quasars to a
limiting magnitude of R~21.

Previous evolutionary computations concerning stars with masses in the range
of the ``Red Giants Transition Phase'' are extended to lower metallicities.
Clusters isochrones for two values of the metallicity Z (Z=10E-4, 4E-4) and for
ages down to 1 billion years are presented, discussing selected evolutionary
features characterizing the structure of the stars during both H or He burning
phases. One finds that clusters with Z about equal to 1E-4 an age around 1-2
billion years could be characterized by the occurrence of anomalous He burning
variables at a luminosity of the order of LogL= 2.0-2.2 (in solar units).

I present an analytic method for estimating the errors in fitting a
distribution. A well-known theorem from statistics gives the minimum variance
bound (MVB) for the uncertainty in estimating a set of parameters $\l_i$, when
a distribution function $F(z;\l_1 ... \l_m)$ is fit to $N$ observations of the
quantity(ies) $z$. For example, a power-law distribution (of two parameters $A$
and $\gaml$) is $F(z;A,\gaml) = A z^{-\gaml}$. I present the MVB in a form
which is suitable for estimating uncertainties in problems of astrophysical
interest. For many distributions, such as a power-law distribution or an
exponential distribution in the presence of a constant background, the MVB can
be evaluated in closed form. I give analytic estimates for the variances in
several astrophysical problems including the gallium solar-neutrino experiments
and the measurement of the polarization induced by a weak gravitational lens. I
show that it is possible to make significant improvements in the accuracy of
these experiments by making simple adjustments in how they are carried out or
analyzed. The actual variance may be above the MVB because of the form of the
distribution function and/or the number of observations. I present simple
methods for recognizing when this occurs and for obtaining a more accurate
estimate of the variance than the MVB when it does.

There was a question raised at this meeting as to the best way to present the
results of experiments measuring anisotropies in the CMB. Here we will make
some simple comments about the 3 main competing methods and some suggestions.
In particular we will give an over-simplified but hopefully useful method of
comparing GACF numbers with other power spectra, and a simple rule-of-thumb for
converting between the two main conventions.

A massive gravitationally bound object with a radius $r \leq 2GM/c^2$, which
occurs in the non-singular version of the nonsymmetric gravitational theory
(NGT), replaces the black hole in Einstein gravity theory. This object is kept
stable by the attractive and repulsive forces generated by NGT, as well as
standard matter pressures, and is called a superdense object (SDO). The
luminosity of gravitational waves emitted by a SDO with a red-shift of order
unity is calculated and it is found that it could be a strong source of
gravitational radiation at low frequencies. The active galactic nucleus of M87
is identified with a SDO and the recent observational results obtained by the
Hubble Space Telesope are used to estimate the amplitude of gravitational
radiation.

We present preliminary results obtained from the comparison of the specific
frequencies of Blue Straggler Stars (BSS) detected so far in a sample of 26
Galactic globular clusters. The number of BSS seems to increase almost linearly
with increasing the amount of sampled light in loose clusters, while it drops
abruptly for clusters having intermediate-high central densities. In
particular, a simple interpretative scenario where the BSS in loose clusters
are produced from primordial binaries and those detected in high density
globulars are due to star interactions leading to binary formation, merging.
etc. seems compatible with these early results. The possibility that this
observational evidence could be ascribed to systematic biases mostly related to
the increasing difficulty to detect BSS candidates with increasing cluster
concentration, is also discussed.

We have determined carbon abundances or upper limits from the forbidden [C I]
line at 8727.13 A for 85 F and early G type main sequence stars, with
metallicities ranging between [Fe/H] = -1.0 and [Fe/H] = +0.25. The [C I] line
has not been previously used for a study of this size. We find that the C/Fe
abundance ratio is slowly decreasing with time and increasing metallicity in
the disk, but with considerable observational scatter. A discussion of results
in the literature supports this result. Our data do not reveal any gradients
with galactocentric birth distance for our stars, but more accurate
observations are desirable since possible gradients should be important to the
question of the synthesis of C and Fe in the disk. (Accepted for publication in

Recently, Owen(1993) and Owen and Ledlow (1994) have shown that the dividing
line between Fanaroff-Riley class~I and class~II Radio Sources is very sharp
when the sources are represented as points in the radio-optical luminosity
plane. It is shown that if one accepts the propositions that the sources in the
vicinity of this dividing line are characterized by (1) transonic Mach numbers
and (2) mildly relativistic velocities (consistent with deceleration of an
initially moderately relativistic or ultrarelativistic jet), then the slope of
the dividing line is readily obtained using simple physical arguments and
established empirical relationships between the X-Ray luminosities, core radii,
velocity dispersions and absolute magnitudes of elliptical galaxies. The
intercept of the dividing line depends upon parameters which are known perhaps
to within factors of order unity and agrees with the data to within an order of
magnitude. ROSAT observations of elliptical galaxies will be important in
constraining the central pressures and X-Ray core radii of radio ellipticals.
Knowledge of these two parameters will assist in a more detailed assessment of
the physics which is proposed here as being relevant. High resolution
observations of jets within a kpc of the radio core will also be useful for
determining the spreading rates of jets in this region.

We have implemented a parallel version of the Barnes-Hut 3-D N-body tree
algorithm under PVM 3.2.5, adopting an SPMD paradigm. We parallelize the
problem by decomposing the physical domain by means of the {\bf Orthogonal
Recursive Bisection} oct-tree scheme suggested by Salmon (1991), but we modify
the original hypercube communication pattern into an incomplete hypercube,
which is more suitable for a generic inhomogenous cluster architecture.\\ We
address dynamical load balancing by assigning different "weights" to the
spawned tasks according to the dynamically changing workloads of each task. The
weights are determined by monitoring the local platforms where the tasks are
running and estimating the performance of each task. The monitoring scheme is
flexible and allows us to address at the same time cluster and intrinsic
sources of load imbalance. We then show measurements of the performance of our
code on a test case of astrophysical interest in order to test the performance
of our implementation.

We consider the dynamical evolution of small-scale substructure in clusters
within two extreme alternate scenarios for their possible origin: 1) the
accretion of groups (or small clusters) on quasi-radial orbits, and 2) the
merger of clusters of similar masses, followed by the decoupling of their dense
cores. Using simple analytical arguments and checking with numerical
computations, we show that objects are destroyed by the tidal field of the
global cluster potential if their mean density is small compared to the mean
cluster density within the radius of closest approach of the group or detached
core. Accreted groups and small clusters are thus tidally disrupted in one
cluster crossing. Since the cores of clusters are much denser than groups, they
are considerably more robust to tides, but the least massive are destroyed or
severely stripped by tides, while the others are brought to the cluster center
by dynamical friction (and subsequently merge) in less than one orbit. The
longest lived substructures are detached cores, roughly ten times less massive
than the cluster, starting in near-circular orbits beyond $1 \, h^{-1} \, \rm
Mpc$ from the cluster center.

In this paper we give a general expression for the energy shift of massless
particles travelling through the gravitational field of an arbitrary matter
distribution as calculated in the weak field limit in an asymptotically flat
space-time. It is {\it not} assumed that matter is non-relativistic. We
demonstrate the surprising result that if the matter is illuminated by a
uniform brightness background that the brightness pattern observed at a given
point in space-time (modulo a term dependent on the oberver's velocity) depends
only on the matter distribution on the observer's past light-cone. These
results apply directly to the cosmological MBR anisotropy pattern generated in
the immediate vicinity of of an object like a cosmic string or global texture.
We apply these results to cosmic strings, finding a correction to previously
published results for in the small-angle approximation. We also derive the
full-sky anisotropy pattern of a collapsing texture knot.

We investigate the local non--linear dynamics of irrotational dust with
vanishing magnetic part of the Weyl tensor, $H_{ab}$. Once coded in the initial
conditions, this dynamical restriction is respected by the relativistic
evolution equations. Thus, the outcome of the latter are {\it exact solutions}
for special initial conditions with $H_{ab}=0$, but with no symmetries: they
describe inhomogeneous triaxial dynamics generalizing that of a fluid element
in a Tolman--Bondi, Kantowski--Sachs or Szekeres geometry. A subset of these
solutions may be seen as (special) perturbations of Friedmann models, in the
sense that there are trajectories in phase--space that pass arbitrarily close
to the isotropic ones. We find that the final fate of ever--expanding
configurations is a spherical void, locally corresponding to a Milne universe.
For collapsing configurations we find a whole family of triaxial attractors,
with vanishing local density parameter $\Omega$. These attractors locally
correspond to Kasner vacuum solutions: there is a single physical configuration
collapsing to a degenerate {\it pancake}, while the generic configuration
collapses to a triaxial {\it spindle} singularity. These {\it silent universe}
models may provide a fair representation of the universe on super horizon
scales. Moreover, one might conjecture that the non--local information carried
by $H_{ab}$ becomes negligible during the late highly non--linear stages of
collapse, so that the attractors we find may give all of the relevant expansion
or collapse configurations of irrotational dust.

With the rapidly growing number of cosmic microwave background measurements
on various scales, there is real hope that the number of acceptable models for
structure formation will be limited to a very few in the near future. Yet any
given model can always be saved by introducing and tuning extraneous free
parameters. To better understand this question of ``nature versus nurture'' for
temperature fluctuations, it is useful to know not only the general features of
anisotropy predictions but also their causes. Extracting the physical content
of our other works, we present here a {\it simple} account of cosmic microwave
background anisotropies on all scales. In particular, we show that analytic
approximations can trace the structure of the so-called ``Doppler peaks,''
which arise due to the {\it adiabatic} oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid.
We also show how the finite thickness of the last scattering surface and the
Silk damping mechanism can be described in a unified way by photon diffusion.
In order to present a specific example, we focus on comparing the primordial
isocurvature baryon (PIB) model with the standard cold dark matter model (CDM).
In particular, we explain why PIB generically predicts larger {\it
non}-oscillatory anisotropies from the 1$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$ scale which may
already be in conflict with experiments.

We examine matter-enhanced neutrino flavor transformation
($\nu_{\tau(\mu)}\rightleftharpoons\nu_e$) in the region above the neutrino
sphere in Type II supernovae. Our treatment explicitly includes contributions
to the neutrino-propagation Hamiltonian from neutrino-neutrino forward
scattering. A proper inclusion of these contributions shows that they have a
completely negligible effect on the range of $\nu_e$-$\nu_{\tau(\mu)}$ vacuum
mass-squared difference, $\delta m^2$, and vacuum mixing angle, $\theta$, or
equivalently $\sin^22\theta$, required for enhanced supernova shock re-heating.
When neutrino background effects are included, we find that $r$-process
nucleosynthesis from neutrino-heated supernova ejecta remains a sensitive probe
of the mixing between a light $\nu_e$ and a $\nu_{\tau(\mu)}$ with a
cosmologically significant mass. Neutrino-neutrino scattering contributions are
found to have a generally small effect on the $(\delta m^2,\ \sin^22\theta)$
parameter region probed by $r$-process nucleosynthesis. We point out that the
nonlinear effects of the neutrino background extend the range of sensitivity of
$r$-process nucleosynthesis to smaller values of $\delta m^2$.

The revised version of the widely circulated preprint ``Neutrino Flavor
Evolution Near A Supernova's Core'' by J. Pantaleone (astro-ph 9405008 on the
Bulletin Board, Indiana University preprint IUHET-276) is wrong. It contains
two errors which lead to incorrect conclusions regarding neutrino flavor
transformation in the supernova environment. In this short note we discuss
these errors.

In inflation cosmologies, cosmic structure develops through the gravitational
instability of the inevitable quantum noise in primordial scalar fields. I show
how the acceleration of the universe defines the shape of the primordial
spectrum of gravitational metric and scalar field fluctuations. I assess how we
can determine the shape and overall amplitude over the five decades or so of
spatial wavelengths we can probe, and use current data ... to show how far we
are in this program. Broad-band power amplitudes are given for CMB anisotropy
detections up to spring 1994 ... I show that COBE band-powers found with full
Bayesian analysis of the $53,90,31$ $a$+$b$ GHz first year DMR (and FIRS) maps
are in good agreement, and are essentially independent of spectral slope and
degree of (sharp) signal-to-noise filtering. Further, after (smooth) optimal
signal-to-noise filtering (\ie Weiner-filtering), the different DMR maps reveal
the same large scale features and correlation functions with little dependence
upon slope. However, the most probable slope depends upon how the maps are
filtered: with no filtering whatsoever, the slope is high, but the power is not
described by a single-slope law; as filtering is increased, the index moves
nearer to inflation predictions. in {\it Relativistic Cosmology}, ed. M.

We consider $\gamma$-ray emission from heavy nuclei that are accelerated in
the shocks of stellar winds and are excited in interactions with the ambient
matter in the Orion complex. We show that the recent detection of $\gamma$-ray
lines in the Orion complex by COMPTEL telescope can be explained by such a
scenario, assuming cosmic abundances. The scenario is consistent with recent
models of cosmic ray acceleration in stellar winds of massive stars.

A ROSAT HRI observation of the cluster MS0839.9+2938 at z=0.194 is presented.
It confirms the earlier suggestion, based on the detection of extended
H$\alpha$ emission, that the inner regions of this cluster are dominated by a
cooling flow. The surface brightness distribution within the cooling radius
shows structures which can be interpreted as evidence of a highly inhomogeneous
space distribution of the cooling process. We note that the brightness at the
barycentre of its distribution, which falls right on top of the central giant
elliptical galaxy, is lower than the peaks in the structures around: we suggest
that this situation is likely to arise as a consequence of photoelectric
absorption by cold gas within the cooling flow, with an equivalent column
density in the order of 5$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ within $\sim$10" from the
centre.

A refined sample of 64 variable objects with stellar image structure has been
identified in SA 57 to $B \sim 22.5$, over a time baseline of 15 years, sampled
at 11 distinct epochs. The photometric data typically have a root-mean-square
error at $B = 22$ of only 0.05 mag. Thirty-five quasars in this field have
already been spectroscopically confirmed, 34 of which are among the sample of
variables. Of the other variables, 6 are known spectroscopically to be stars,
10 additional objects are stars based on reliable detection of proper motion,
and 1 is spectroscopically a narrow-emission-line galaxy. Of the 13 remaining
variables, it is argued that they are a mixture of distant halo subdwarfs and
quasars with star-like colors. We compute the ensemble average structure
function and autocorrelation function from the light curves in the respective
quasar rest-frames, which are used to investigate the general dependences on
apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and redshift.

Massive clusters of galaxies gravitationally shear the images of faint
background galaxies. At large impact parameters the shear is weak, but can
still be measured, to a reasonable degree of significance, as a statistical
anisotropy of the faint galaxy images. We describe techniques for measuring the
shear and discuss the interpretation of the shear field. We have applied this
analysis to ms1224+007. We find a clear detection of the shear, but,
puzzlingly, we find a mass about three times that obtained by application of
the virial theorem, and obtain a very large mass-to-light ratio. Similar
results have been obtained by other groups, and we discuss their implications.

We add black holes to nonrotating, spherical galaxy models, with the
assumption that the black-hole growth is slow compared with the dynamical time
but fast compared with the relaxation time. The outcome differs depending on
whether the core of the initial galaxy does or does not resemble that of an
isothermal sphere. For the isothermal case the previously-known results are
confirmed and sharpened: the black hole induces cusps in the density ($\rho\sim
r^{-3/2}$) and velocity dispersion ($v^2\sim r^{-1}$), and a tangential
anisotropy in the velocity distribution away from the center. For the
non-isothermal case the induced density cusp is steeper, and the induced
anisotropy is larger and penetrates right to the center. The cusp around the
black hole is insensitive to anisotropy in the initial velocity distribution,
and also to the origin of the black hole, unless its mass comes exclusively
from the stars of lowest angular momentum, in which case the cusp is
suppressed. We discuss the implications for the interpretation of evidence for
massive black holes in galactic nuclei.

Big-bang nucleosynthesis is one of the cornerstones of the standard
cosmology. For almost thirty years its predictions have been used to test the
big-bang model to within a fraction of a second of the bang. The concordance
that exists between the predicted and observed abundances of D, $^3$He, $^4$He
and $^7$Li provides important confirmation of the standard cosmology and leads
to the most accurate determination of the baryon density, between $1.7 \times
10^{-31}\gcmm3$ and $4.1\times 10^{-31}\gcmm3$ (corresponding to between about
1\% and 14\% of critical density). This measurement of the density of ordinary
matter is crucial to almost every aspect of cosmology and is pivotal to the
establishment of two dark-matter problems: (i) most of the baryons are dark,
and (ii) if the total mass density is greater than about 14\% of the critical
density as many determinations now indicate, the bulk of the dark matter must
be ``nonbaryonic,'' comprised of elementary particles left from the earliest
moments. We critically review the present status of primordial nucleosynthesis
and discuss future prospects.

Norris et al. (1994) report that the temporal structure of faint gamma ray
bursts is longer than that of bright bursts, as expected for time dilation in
the cosmological models of burst origin. I show that the observed trends can
easily be produced by a burst luminosity function and thus may not result from
cosmological effects. A cosmological signature may be present, but the tests
Norris et al. present are not powerful enough to detect these signatures.

We present the results of the analysis of the ROSAT PSPC pointed observation
of the S0 galaxy NGC5866. Previous Einstein observations had revealed that this
galaxy has a low X-ray to optical ratio Lx/Lb. Theoretical models of the X-ra
emission of early-type galaxies had suggested that in objects of this kind the
emission is not dominated by the presence of a hot diffuse gas, but should
originate in stellar sources. We discuss the evidence in favor of this
hypothesis following from the results of the analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data.
The X-ray spectrum shows properties similar to those of the other two low Lx/Lb
early-type galaxies observed by ROSAT so far, including the presence of very
soft emission. So, these galaxies can be recognized as a group with homogeneous
properties, and a more exhaustive picture of the nature of the X-ray emission
across the Lx/Lb plane of early-type galaxies can be outlined. We also discuss
the importance of rotation in the X-ray emission of S0 galaxies, and suggest
that it could explain why on average S0s are less X-ray luminous than
ellipticals.

The MACHO project carries out regular photometric monitoring of millions of
stars in the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic Bulge, to search for very rare
gravitational microlensing events due to compact objects in the galactic halo
and disk. A preliminary analysis of one field in the Galactic Bulge, containing
{$\sim430,000$} stars observed for 190 days, reveals four stars which show
clear evidence for brightenings which are time-symmetric, achromatic in our two
passbands, and have shapes consistent with gravitational microlensing. This is
significantly higher than the $\sim 1$ event expected from microlensing by
known stars in the disk. If all four events are due to microlensing, a 95\%
confidence lower limit on the optical depth towards our bulge field is $1.3
\times 10^{-6}$, and a ``best fit" value is $\tau \approx 1.6 \times
10^{-6}/\epsilon$,where $\epsilon$ is the detection efficiency of the
experiment, and $\epsilon < 0.4$. If the true optical depth is close to the
``best fit" value, possible explanations include a ``maximal" disk which
accounts for most of the galactic circular velocity at the solar radius, a halo
which is centrally concentrated, or bulge-bulge microlensing.

The analysis of the first two years of OGLE data revealed 9 microlensing
events of the galactic bulge stars, with the characteristic time scales in the
range $ 8.6 < t_0 < 62 $ days, where $ t_0 = R_E / V $. The optical depth to
microlensing is larger than $ ( 3.3 \pm 1.2 ) \times 10^{-6}$, in excess of
current theoretical estimates, indicating a much higher efficiency for
microlensing by either bulge or disk lenses. We argue that the lenses are
likely to be ordinary stars in the galactic bar, which has its long axis
elongated towards us. A relation between $ t_0 $ and the lens masses remains
unknown until a quantitative model of bar microlensing becomes available. At
this time we have no evidence that the OGLE events are related to dark matter.
The geometry of lens distribution can be determined observationally when the
microlensing rate is measured over a larger range of galactic longitudes, like
$ -10^o < l < +10^o $, and the relative proper motions of the galactic bulge
(bar) stars are measured with the HST.

We use the void probability statistics to study the redshift-space galaxy
distribution as described by a volume-limited subsample of the Perseus-Pisces
survey. We compare the results with the same analysis realized on artificial
samples, extracted from high-resolution N-body simulations by reproducing the
observational biases of the real data set. Simulations are run for the
Cold+HotDM model (CHDM) and for unbiased and biased (b=1.5) CDM models in a 50
Mpc/h box. We identify galaxies as residing in peaks of the evolved density
field. We fragment overmerged structures into individual galaxies so as to
reproduce both the correct luminosity function (after assuming M/ L values for
the resulting galaxy groups) and the two-point correlation function. Our main
result is that a void-probability function (VPF) from the standard CHDM model
with fractions 60% cold, 30% hot, 10% barions, exceeds the observational VPF
with a high confidence level. CDM models produce smaller VPF independent of the
biasing parameter. We verify the robustness of this result against changing the
observer position in the simulations and the galaxy identification in the
evolved density field.

The conjecture that dark matter in galaxies is mostly cold fractal gas is
developed in the more general context of the thermodynamics of the ideal
isothermal gas subject to gravitational instability. This simple gas model
already contains the contrary ingredients able to prevent an asymptotic
equilibrium: any growing gravothermal singularity evaporates in a finite time,
and any tendency to uniform gas is gravitationally unstable. The paradox is
simply resolved by allowing fractal states, which are then scale-free and
steady {\it in average}, but non-differentiable and time-dependent. If we apply
to clusters the lessons learned with galaxies, we are led to the conclusion
that gas in clusters at a temperature much below the virial temperature should
also adopt a fractal structure and become inhomogeneous. The same instrumental
biases acting at galactic scale and preventing the detection of the smallest
and coldest sub-resolution clumps in the fractal are then even more relevant
for cluster gas measurements. The large baryonic mass observed in the cluster
hot gas and the morphology-density relation suggest also gaseous dark matter in
spirals. If this dark gas component remains undetected in spirals, the same
instrumental biases should hold in clusters, where cooling hot gas disappears
from detection near the centre.

Major progresses have been made this last year towards a better knowledge of
the invisible mass. Michel Spiro will talk in details about the micro-lensing
experiments and their promising results; the ROSAT satellite has provided
extended X-ray maps of the hot gas, which traces dark matter in galaxy
clusters: they reveal lower amounts of dark matter in clusters than was
previously derived; the dark to visible mass in clusters is not larger than its
value in spiral galaxies. It was shown, by X-ray data and gravitational lenses
analysis that the dark matter density is highly peaked towards the cluster
centers. A new dark matter candidate has also been proposed, in the form of
cold and fractal molecular gas that could be present around most late-type
spiral galaxies and account for the observed flat rotation curves.

We present the analysis of the first two years of the OGLE search for
gravitational lenses towards the Galactic bulge. We detected 9 microlensing
events in an algorithmic search of $ \sim 10^8 $ measurements of $ \sim 10^6 $
stars. The characteristic time scales are in the range $ 8.6 < t_0 < 62 $ days,
where $ t_0 = R_E / V $. The distribution of amplitudes is consistent with
theoretical expectation. The stars seem to be drawn at random from the overall
distribution of the observed bulge stars. We find that the optical depth to
microlensing is larger than $ ( 3.3 \pm 1.2 ) \times 10^{-6}$, in excess of
current theoretical estimates.

We model the temperature distribution at the surface of a magnetized neutron
star and study the effects on the observable X-ray spectra and light curves,
taking fully into account gravitational lensing. Only dipolar fields are
considered here. General features are studied and compared with the ROSAT data
from the pulsars 0833-45 (Vela), 0656+14, 0630+178 (Geminga), and 1055-52.
  The composite blackbody spectra obtained are not very different from a black-
body spectrum at the star's effective temperature: temperature estimates using
single temperature models are practically equivalent to composite model
results.
  Gravitational lensing strongly suppresses the light curve pulsations: this
may be a new tool to constrain the size of neutron stars.
  Dipolar surface fields yield many features somewhat similar to the observed
ones but are not sufficient for an accurate description.
  The pulsed fractions obtained in all our models increase with photon energy:
the strong decrease observed in Geminga at energies 0.3 - 0.5 keV is definitely
a genuine effect of the atmospheric magnetic field on the locally emitted
spectrum in contradistinction to the magnetic effects on the surface
temperature.
  A complete model will have to consider complex surface field structures and
include effects of the atmospheric magnetic field on the emitted spectrum.

The results of recent AGN monitoring campaigns confirm the ``big picture'' of
the echo paradigm, but the details of the emission-line light curves cannot be
accurately reproduced with only the simplest assumptions, some of which must be
invalid. I discuss possible solutions. I present some preliminary optical light
curves from Wise Observatory for NGC 4151 during the December
  1993 multi-satellite campaign. The optical data show a continuity with the
complex behavior observed in the IUE data, and may explain the peculiarities in
emission-line response seen in this and other AGNs. I review some recent
results on quasar emission line variability from the Steward-Wise PG quasar
monitoring program, which allow extension of the observed AGN BLR
Radius--Luminosity relation to higher luminosities than previously feasible.
Agreement with the expected $R\propto L^{1/2}$ relation is suggested. Finally,
I criticize the trend to attribute significance to the details of transfer
functions recovered by inversion techniques. I show, as an example, that the
model emission-line light curves produced by convolving the 5-year continuum
light curve of NGC 5548 with transfer functions peaked at zero or non-zero lag
have differences much smaller that the uncertainties in the H$\beta$ light
curve. Transfer functions of both kinds can reproduce the data equally well. I
emphasize the need to use modeling, rather than inversion methods, in order to
delineate the regions of BLR parameter space allowed and ruled out by the data.

This paper presents results of a series of numerical N-body experiments that
describe the merging of galaxy pairs containing a massive black hole in their
core. The aim is to study the orbital evolution of the two black holes through
the merger event. It is found that merging does NOT lead to the formation of a
CLOSE black hole pair} at the center of the remnant when the two progenitor
galaxies have (1) similar masses, (2) different central densities, and (3)
relative orbit with non zero angular momentum. Under these conditions, the
central black hole of the less dense galaxy settles into an wide orbit, i.e.,
at a distance from the center comparable to the half mass radius of the
remnant, where the time scale for orbital decay by dynamical friction can be
several Gyrs. The implications of this result are briefly discussed.

We re-examine the systematic errors in the determination of the primordial
helium abundance, $Y_{\rm P}$. We find that the systematics are significantly
larger than the statistical errors. The uncertainty in (the determination of)
$Y_{\rm P}$, is thus, larger than is currently claimed. Furthermore, most of
the systematics lead to underestimate of $Y_{\rm P}$. The new upper bound
allows cosmological models with no non-baryonic dark matter in which
$\Omega_{baryons} = \Omega_{BBN} = \Omega_{dyn}$.

A review is presented of recent work by the authors concerning the use of
large scale structure and microwave background anisotropy data to determine the
potential of the inflaton field. The importance of a detection of the
stochastic gravitational wave background is emphasised, and some preliminary
new results of tests of the method on simulated data sets with uncertainties
are described. (Proceedings of ``Unified Symmetry in the Small and in the
Large'', Coral Gables, 1994)

We present a CCD investigation of the galactic globular M5 aimed to increase
the statistical relevance of the available sample of evolving bright stars.
Previous investigations, limited to the outer cluster region, have been
extended toward the cluster center, more than doubling the number of observed
luminous stars. On this basis, we discuss a statistically relevant sample, rich
of 415 HB stars. The occurrence of a gap in the blue side of the HB is
suggested. Comparison to the current evolutionary scenario discloses a good
agreement concerning both the C-M diagram location and the relative abundance
of stars in the advanced evolutionary phases, supporting our present knowledge
of the evolution of low mass stars. Determination of the amount of the original
helium content through the ratio R N(HB)/N(RGB) gives $Y = 0.22 \pm 0.02$.

If the halo dark matter consists of faint baryonic stars, then these objects
probably formed at an early epoch within large associations with similar
dynamical properties to globular or open clusters. We use the luminosity
function of globular clusters as a function of galactocentric distance to
provide a very strong constraint on the properties of RAMBOs. We show that at
the solar radius, dynamical constraints confine such clusters to a bounded and
narrow parameter space with effective radii between 1 pc and 15 pc,
corresponding to masses between $ \sim 10 -10^4 M_\odot$ and $\sim
10^4-10^6M_\odot$, respectively. Compact and massive clusters are excluded by
these constraints, and therefore cannot provide a heating source capable of
explaining the observed correlation between age and velocity dispersion for
disk stars. Less than 1\% of the halo could be within RAMBOs of mass
$10^7M_\odot$;an order magnitude lower than required in the model proposed by
Wasserman \& Salpeter. Neither the IRAS or ISO infrared satellites have the
capability to detect clusters of brown dwarfs within the dynamically allowed
parameter space. Clusters of white dwarfs that formed a Hubble time ago have a
surface brightness several magnitudes below the sky level; even clusters of low
mass stars at the edge of the main sequence would remain invisible to the
deepest K band surveys to date. We conclude that gravitational microlensing is
the only method capable of constraining the abundance of dark matter in the
form of clusters of stars. Recovering the dynamical properties of RAMBOs will
be very difficult due to their large covering factor and low internal velocity
dispersion.

In the first two of these lectures, I present the evidence for baryonic dark
matter and describe possible forms that it may take. The final lecture
discusses formation of baryonic dark matter, and sets the cosmological context.

Clusters of galaxies acting as gravitational lenses deform the images of
background galaxies. For small galaxies the deformation is determined by the
local properties of the lens (shear, convergence). Small circular shaped
galaxies are seen as small ellipses. The orientation and axial ratio of the
ellipses could then be used to trace the properties of the lens. We introduce
and solve an ordinary homogeneous linear first order differential equation
which describes completely the radial cluster lens. It can be used to
reconstruct the lens mappeing from the measured axial ratios of lensed
background galaxies.

The topic of this letter is structure formation with topological defects. We
first present a partially new, fully local and gauge invariant system of
perturbation equations to treat microwave background and dark matter
fluctuations induced by topological defects (or any other type of seeds). We
show that this treatment is extremly well suited for linear numerical analysis
of structure formation by applying it to the texture scenario. Our numerical
results cover a larger dynamical range than previous investigations and are
complementary since we use substantially different methods.

A crucial test of any cosmological model is the distribution of distant
objects such as quasars. Because of well defined selection criteria quasars
found by a ultraviolet excess (UVX) survey are ideal candidates for testing the
model out to a redshift of z = 2.2. The static cosmology proposed by Crawford
(1993) is used to analyse a recent quasar survey (BOYLE et al MNRAS 227, 717
1990). It is shown that the distribution of number of quasars from the survey
as a function of redshift is in excellent agreement with the predictions of the
model. A V/V_m test on 351 confirmed quasars with defined redshifts has a mean
value of 0.568\pm 0.015 with the discrepancy being most likely due to
incompleteness of the catalogue at low redshifts. For the redshift range $1.5 <
z < 2.2$ where the accuracy of the cosmological model is critical V/V_m was
0.51 \pm 0.02. A well defined quasar luminosity function is derived that has a
peak at M_B = -21.16 mag and is well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in
absolute magnitude with a standard deviation of 1.52 magnitudes.

In principle the geometry of the universe can be investigated by measuring
the angular size of known objects as a function of distance. Thus the
distribution of angular sizes provides a critical test of the stable and static
model of the universe described by Crawford (1991,1993) that has a simple and
explicit relationship between the angular size of an object and its redshift.
The result is that the agreement with observations of galactic diameters and
the size of double radio sources with the static model is much better than the
standard (Big Bang) theory without evolution. However there is still a small
discrepancy at large redshifts that could be due to selection effects.

We discuss a possible method for detection of dark companions of galactic
objects of stellar mass. Such binary systems are likely to occur in the
galactic disk and possibly also in the halo. The high incidence of binary and
higher-multiplicity systems in the solar neighborhood, if indicative of the
galactic disk at large, implies that current searches for the gravitational
microlensing signature of massive compact objects in our galaxy would yield a
significant fraction of binary systems. Our calculations suggest that 40% of
the lightcurves that will be obtained in such searches may be sufficiently
perturbed to reveal, if sufficiently well-sampled, the presence of a compact
dark companion of Jovian mass orbiting a primary. The likelihood of occurrence
of perturbed lightcurves must also be taken into account by systematic search
programs, to improve their event detection efficiency. The statistics of
perturbed lensing events, if carefully interpreted, could yield estimates of
the incidence of binary systems with low mass ratios, including that of systems
with planets.

We have made VLA images of the fields around three young pulsars which have
resulted in the discovery of two new supernova remnants and confirmation of a
third. We argue that, in at least two cases and perhaps the third, the pulsars
are physically associated with these supernova remnants. A review of all known
young pulsars shows that the majority are associated with supernova remnants.
We show that the typical density of the interstellar medium into which the
supernova remnants are evolving has a density of 0.2 cm$^{-3}$ instead of the
low value of 0.01 cm$^{-3}$ which had been calculated from other studies, and
results in a considerably longer radio lifetime for supernova remnants. Both
the morphology of the supernova remnants and the location of the pulsars imply
that most of these young pulsars are born with large transverse velocities
($\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$). This high velocity mean in the distribution of pulsar
velocities appears to be a general property of the pulsar population at birth,
not seen in proper motion studies, due to selection effects. We explore the
implications of this result as it relates to the origin of these velocities and
the galactic distribution of pulsars. High velocity pulsars can escape their
supernova remnant in a very short timescale, comparable to the lifetime of the
remnant and may even play a role in extending the observable radio lifetime of
the remnant. A significant fraction will be capable of escaping the disk of the
Galaxy, producing an extended halo population.

The distortion of images of faint, high-redshift galaxies by light deflection
at foreground clusters of galaxies can be used to determine the (projected)
mass distribution of the clusters. In the case of strong distortions, which
lead to arcs in clusters, the position of the arc and/or its radius of
curvature yields an estimate for the total mass inside a circle traced out by
the arc. Weak distortions, which can be observed to much larger angular
separations, can be used to determine the mass profile. In the case of weak
distortions, an approximation which identifies the observed distortion with the
shear produced by the lens can be made; this (linear) approximation breaks
down, however, if one wants to probe the center of the cluster, i.e., approach
the region within which giant arcs can be formed. The methods developed
hitherto, the most advanced of which is due to Kaiser \& Squires, rely on the
linear approximation and thus cannot yield reliable results for regions close
to the center of the cluster. The purpose of this paper is to provide a
theoretical basis to extend the Kaiser \& Squires method into the nonlinear
regime, thereby making it more powerful, since the nonlinear distortions
provide strong constraints on the mass profile, which in combination with the
weak distortions should yield more reliable cluster inversions. We discuss the
statistical properties of the observable image ellipticities and provide
several methods to determine the local distortion by the lens from observed
galaxy images, some of which rely

We estimate the angular correlation function for the standard CDM, tilted
$n=0.7$ CDM and hybrid (CHDM) models, and compare with observations. When
compared with the APM observational results scaled to the Lick depth, there
appears to be fair agreement with the estimate from the CHDM model. But a more
detailed comparison using the unscaled APM data for the five magnitude slices
with $\Delta b_j=0.5$ shows that, in fact, none of the models can actually fit
w(theta) for all the slices simultaneously.
  As $n=0.7$ tilted CDM and SCDM bracket all possible tilted models, we
conclude that none of the tilted models is consistent with the APM results.
With CHDM, a \wtheta amplitude that is 30\%--40\% too high on scales $\theta <
0.\deg 5$ is predicted for the deepest slices ($b_j\approx 20$). We find that
no reasonable simple variation of the parameters for the luminosity function or
for the evolution of the correlation function with redshift could change the
situation. Thus, the discrepancy between the APM data and the CHDM model,
though small, seems to be real.

We show that a class of inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis models exist
which yield light-element abundances in agreement with observational
constraints for baryon-to-photon ratios significantly smaller than those
inferred from standard homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis (HBBN). These
inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis models are characterized by a bimodal
distribution of baryons in which some regions have a local baryon-to-photon
ratio eta=3*10e-10, while the remaining regions are baryon-depleted. HBBN
scenarios with primordial (2H+3He)/H<9*10e-5 necessarily require that most
baryons be in a dark or non-luminous form, although new observations of a
possible high deuterium abundance in Lyman-alpha clouds may relax this
requirement somewhat. The models described here present another way to relax
this requirement and can even eliminate any lower bound on the baryon-to-photon
ratio.

A local void in the globally Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological
model is studied. The inhomogeneity is described using the
Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution with the spherically symmetric matter
distribution based on the faint galaxies number counts. We investigate the
effects this has on the measurement of the Hubble constant and the
redshift--luminosity distance relation for moderately and very distant objects
($z \approx 0.1$ and more). The results, while fully compatible with
cosmological observations, indicate that if we happened to live in such a void,
but insisted on interpreting cosmological observations through the FRW model,
we could get a few unexpected results. For example the Hubble constant
measurement could give results depending on the separation of the source and
the observer.

Detection of the tensor perturbations predicted in inflationary models is
important for testing inflation as well as for reconstructing the inflationary
potential. We show that because of cosmic variance the tensor contribution to
the square of the CBR quadrupole anisotropy must be greater than about 20\% of
the scalar contribution to ensure a statistically significant detection of
tensor perturbations. This sensitivity could be achieved by full-sky
measurements on angular scales of $3^{\circ}$ and $0.5^\circ$.

The observed cosmic abundances of light elements are most consistent with
each other, and with the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis,if, contrary
to the usual assumption, galactic chemical evolution reduces $(D+\ ^3He)/H$
with time. Chemical evolution models which do this require that low mass stars
destroy $^3He$ in the envelope gas that they return to the interstellar medium.
A simple argument based on the rates of limiting nuclear reactions shows that
the same giant branch mixing process which appears to be needed to explain the
observed $^{12}C/ ^{13}C$ and $C/N$ ratios in 1-- 2$\msol$ stars would indeed
also probably destroy $^3He$ by a large factor in the bulk of the envelope
material. The conclusion is that Galactic $^3He/H$ estimates should not be
trusted for setting an upper limit on primordial $(D+ ^3He)/H$. This removes
the strongest lower bound on the cosmic baryon density from big bang
nucleosynthesis and the only argument for abundant baryonic dark matter.

Striking similarities exist between high energy gamma ray emission from
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gamma ray bursts (GRBs). They suggest that
GRBs are generated by inverse Compton scattering from highly relativistic
electrons in transient jets. Such jets may be produced along the axis of an
accretion disk formed around stellar black holes (BH) or neutron stars (NS) in
BH-NS and NS-NS mergers and in accretion induced collapse of magnetized white
dwarfs (WD) or neutron stars in close binary systems. Such events may produce
the cosmological GRBs. Transient jets formed by single old magnetized neutron
stars in an extended Galactic halo may produce a local population of GRBs. Here
we show that jet production of GRBs by inverse Compton scattering can explain
quite simply the striking correlations that exist between various temporal
features of GRBs, their duration histogram, the power spectrum of their complex
multipeak light curves, their power-law high energy spectra and other features
of GRBs. Some additional predictions are made including the expected
polarization of gamma-rays in the bursts.

A detailed analysis of the galaxy distribution in the Southern Sky Redshift
Survey (SSRS) by means of the multifractal or scaling formalism is presented.
It is shown that galaxies cluster in different ways according to their
morphological type as well as their size. Ellipticals are more clustered than
spirals, even at scales up to 15 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, whereas no clear segregation
between early and late spirals is found. It is also shown that smaller galaxies
distribute more homogeneously than larger galaxies.

We report on a current investigation of the anisotropy pattern induced by
cosmic strings on the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR). We have
numerically evolved a network of cosmic strings from a redshift of $Z = 100$ to
the present and calculated the anisotropies which they induce. Based on a
limited number of realizations, we have compared the results of our simulations
with the observations of the COBE-DMR experiment. We have obtained a
preliminary estimate of the string mass-per-unit-length $\mu$ in the cosmic
string scenario.

I derive an upper limit to the distance to SN 1987A of $\dsn<46.77\pm
0.76\,\kpc$, or a distance modulus $\mu_\sn<18.350\pm 0.035$. If SN 1987A lies
in the plane of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and hence 500 pc in front of
the LMC center, this implies $\mu_\lmc<18.37\pm 0.04$. The determination rests
on a new measurement of the caustics in the ionized-emission light curves of
$t_-=75.0\pm 2.6\,$days and $t_+=390.0\pm 1.8\,$days. The estimate assumes that
the ring is circular. This assumption is shown to be consistent with the
available data and can be subjected to a future precise test. Moreover, I have
previously shown that modest deviations from circularity (eccentricities
$e<0.4$) affect the result by $<1\%$. The upper limit to the distance modulus
to M31 is $\mu_{\rm M31} < 24.43\pm 0.06$. If the response function of the
supernova-ring gas is prompt, then these upper limits become equalities.

We investigate the cosmic variance of the skewness of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropies in an inflationary model which leads to the
baryon isocurvature scenario for the cosmic structure formation. In this model,
the baryon number fluctuations are given by a sinusoidal function of a random
Gaussian field. We find that the skewness is very small in comparison with that
of the fluctuations which obey Gaussian statistics.

Photographic F band photometry of a sample of 36 Abell clusters has been used
to study the relation between the magnitude $M_1$ of the brightest cluster
member and the Schechter function parameter $M^*$. Clusters appear segregated
in the $M_1$-$M^*$ plane according to their Rood \& Sastry class. We prove on a
statistical basis that on average, going from early to late RS classes, $M_1$
becomes brighter while $M^*$ becomes fainter. The result agrees with the
predictions of galactic cannibalism models, never confirmed by previous
analyses.

Ten recently-published solar models give $\7be$ neutrino fluxes that lie
within a range of $\pm 10$\% of the average value, a convergence that is
independent of uncertainties in the measured laboratory rate of the
$\7be(p,\gamma)\8b$ reaction. If nothing happens to solar neutrinos after they
are created ({\it a la} standard electroweak theory) and the operating solar
neutrino experiments are correct, then the $\7be$ solar neutrino flux must be
less than 50\% of the solar model value. At least three of the four existing
solar neutrino experiments must be wrong {\it if}: (1) standard electroweak
theory is correct, and (2) the true $\7be$ neutrino flux lies within the range
predicted by standard solar models.

We study the effects of peculiar velocities on statistical measures of galaxy
clustering. These effects occur when distances to the galaxies are estimated
from their redshifts. It is assumed that the clustering pattern results from
the gravitational instability of initially Gaussian, small-amplitude
perturbations of a Friedman-Lemaitre cosmological model. Explicit expressions
are given for an arbitrary density parameter \Omega of the model, both when the
cosmological constant, \Lambda, is zero, and when the model is spatially flat,
\Omega + \Lambda/3H^2 =1. We show how to compute the skewness, or third moment
of the density field, in redshift space, and its Fourier space counterpart, the
bispectrum. We rely on a perturbative expansion of particle trajectories in
Lagrangian coordinates. This formalism extends to higher orders the Zel'dovich
first order solution (1970). We show that a physically consistent and
quantitatively accurate analysis of the growth skewness in redshift space can
be obtained from second-order Lagrangian theory. We also study the effects of
spatial smoothing of the evolved density field. We give analytic expressions
for the gravitationally induced skewness as a function of the power spectrum
and of \Omega, for a spherical top-hat and a Gaussian smoothing filter. We
compare our analytical predictions with measurements performed in numerical
simulations, and find good agreement. These results should then prove useful in
analyzing large scale redshift surveys. In particular, our results, in
conjunction with the recent suggestion of Fry (1994), may help to break the
coupling between the bias and the cosmological

We present a technique of calculating microwave anisotropies from global
defects in a reionised universe. We concentrate on angular scales down to one
degree where we expect the nongaussianity of the temperature anisotropy in
these models to become apparent.

We decompose the luminosity function of Galactic globular clusters into a sum
of the orthogonal Gauss-Hermite functions. This method quantifies the
asymmetric third-order ($h_3$) and symmetric fourth-order ($h_4$) terms of the
distribution while minimizing the effect of outliers in the data. For 138
Galactic globulars we obtain $<M_V>=-7.41\pm0.11$, $\sigma(M_V)=1.24$ mag,
$h_3=0.02\pm 0.05$, and $h_4=0.06 \pm 0.05$, {\em i.e.\/} the core of the
distribution does not differ significantly from a Gaussian. For a
low-metallicity subsample of 103 globular clusters with $[Fe/H]<-0.8$, we find
$<M_V>=-7.48\pm0.11$, $\sigma(M_V)=1.08$ mag, $h_3=0.05 \pm 0.05$, and
$h_4=0.13 \pm 0.05$.

We present results on the non-linear dynamics of inhomogeneous cosmological
models with irrotational dust and a positive cosmological constant,
considering, in particular, a wide class with vanishing magnetic Weyl tensor.
For those patches of the universe that do not recollapse to a singularity we
find a unique attractor, representing a de Sitter vacuum phase. For the
(re-)collapsing regions we find a family of (Kasner) attractors, so that
generically these regions fall in spindle-like singularities. These results
give substantial support to the idea that the universe can be very
inhomogeneous on ultra-large, super-horizon scales, whit observers living in
those (almost) isotropic regions that emerge from an inflationary phase.

Starlight from distant galaxies ($z > 3$) is redshifted into the near
infrared band with observed wavelengths from 2-8 $\mu$m. Most of the light is
emitted by stars that have a peak emission at the 1.6 $\mu$m wavelength of the
minimum of the H$^-$ opacity. We present simulated images of galaxy and star
fields at 3, 4.7 and 8 $\mu$m, using the expected performance of the infrared
camera on the Space InfraRed Telescope Facility (SIRTF). Standard astronomical
image processing tools are used to locate sources, distinguish stars from
galaxies, and create color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for the galaxies.

Some of the technical details involved in taking and analyzing data from COBE
are discussed, and recent results from the FIRAS and DMR experiments are
summarized. Some of the cosmological implications of these recent data are
presented.

In this paper we investigate the hot end of the HB, presenting evolutionary
constraints concerning the CM diagram location and the gravity of hot HB stars.
According to the adopted evolutionary scenario, we predict an upper limit for
HB temperatures of about logTe = 4.45, remarkably cooler than previous
estimates. We find that such a theoretical prescription appears in good
agreement with available observational data concerning both stellar
temperatures and gravities.

Isochrone computations and horizontal branch (HB) models for Y(MS)=0.23 and
two values of Z (0.0001, 0.0004)are used to derive constraints on the age
indicators and HB morphology of metal-poor clusters with age t (in Gyrs) in the
range of 1< t < 20.It is found that for fixed metallicity the luminosity
L(3.83) of the zero age horizontalbranch (ZAHB) at the RR Lyrae gap depends on
age and that the difference in visual magnitude between main sequence turn-off
(TO) and ZAHB may be calibrated in terms of age and metallicity. The results of
synthetic HB computations show that at fixed metallicity the mean luminosity of
RR Lyraes depends on HB morphology, as well as that the mean luminosity of
purely red horizontal branches depends on the age and amount of mass loss
during the red giant phase.
  Such features should be properly taken into account when the cluster age is
derived from the observed difference in magnitude between main sequence TO and
actual horizontal branch (rather than ZAHB). Moreover, it is shown that the
observed HB morphology provides us with an easy estimate of the upper limit of
the cluster age. Some useful constraints to the cluster metallicity could be
also derived.

A small fraction of galaxies appear to reside in dense compact groups, whose
inferred crossing times are much shorter than a Hubble time. These short
crossing times have led to considerable disagreement about the dynamical state
of these systems. We suggest that many of the observed groups are not
physically bound but are chance projections of galaxies well-separated along
the line of sight. Unlike earlier similar proposals, ours does not require that
the galaxies in the compact group be members of a more diffuse, but physically
bound entity. The probability of physically separated galaxies projecting into
an apparent compact group is non-negligible if most galaxies are distributed,
as observed, in thin filaments. We illustrate this general point with a
specific example: a simulation of a cold dark matter universe, in which
hydrodynamic effects are included to identify galaxies. The simulated galaxy
distribution is filamentary, and end-on views of these filaments produce
apparent galaxy associations that have sizes and velocity dispersions similar
to those of observed compact groups. The frequency of such projections can
explain the observed space-density of groups in the Hickson catalog. We discuss
the implications of our proposal for the formation and evolution of groups and
elliptical galaxies. The proposal can be tested by using redshift-independent
distance estimators to measure the line-of-sight spatial extent of nearby
compact groups.

I give a general formulation of the constraints on models of inflation ended
by a first order phase transition arising from the requirement that they do not
produce too many large (observable) true vacuum voids -- the `big bubble
problem'. It is shown that this constraint can be satisfied by a simple model
in Einstein gravity -- a variant of `hybrid' or `false vacuum' inflation. (Talk
presented at `Birth of the Universe' workshop Rome, May 1994)

Although cosmologists have been trying to determine the value of the Hubble
constant for nearly 65 years, they have only succeeded in limiting the range of
possibilities: most of the current observational determinations place the
Hubble constant between 50 km/s/Mpc and 90 km/s/Mpc. The uncertainty is
unfortunate because this fundamental parameter of cosmology determines both the
distance scale and the time scale, and thereby affects almost all aspects of
cosmology. Here we make the case for a Hubble constant that is even smaller
than the lower bound of the accepted range, arguing on the basis of the great
advantages, all theoretical in nature, of a Hubble constant of around 30
km/s/Mpc. Those advantages are: (1) a comfortable expansion age that avoids the
current age crisis; (2) a cold dark matter power spectrum whose shape is in
good agreement with the observational data and (3) which predicts an abundance
of clusters in close agreement with that of x-ray selected galaxy clusters; (4)
a nonbaryonic to baryonic mass ratio that is in better agreement with recent
determinations based upon cluster x-ray studies. In short, such a value for the
Hubble constant cures almost all the ills of the current theoretical orthodoxy,
a flat Universe comprised predominantly of cold dark matter.

We suggest a new model for the structure of a magnetic field embedded high
$\beta$ turbulent plasma, based on the popular notion that the magnetic field
will tend to separate into individual flux tubes. We point out that
interactions between the flux tubes will be dominated by coherent effects
stemming from the turbulent wakes created as the fluid streams by the flux
tubes. Balancing the attraction caused by shielding effects with turbulent
diffusion we find that flux tubes have typical radii comparable to the local
Mach number squared times the large scale eddy length, are arranged in a one
dimensional fractal pattern, have a radius of curvature comparable to the
largest scale eddies in the turbulence, and have an internal magnetic pressure
comparable to the ambient pressure. When the average magnetic energy density is
much less than the turbulent energy density the radius, internal magnetic field
and curvature scale of the flux tubes will be smaller than these estimates.
Realistic resistivity does not alter the macroscopic properties of the fluid or
the large scale magnetic field. In either case we show that the Sweet-Parker
reconnection rate is much faster than an eddy turnover time. Realistic stellar
plasmas are expected to either be in the ideal limit (e.g. the solar
photosphere) or the resistive limit (most of the solar convection zone). All
current numerical simulations of three dimensional MHD turbulence are in the
viscous regime and are inapplicable to stars or accretion disks.

The evolution of the electro-weak phase transition, including reheating due
to the release of latent heat in shock waves, is calculated for various values
of as yet unknown parameters of electro-weak theory such as latent heat and
bubble wall surface tension. We show that baryon production, which occurs in
the vicinity of the bubble walls of the phase transition, can be a sensitive
function of bubble wall velocity, and this velocity dependence is important to
include in the calculation of the baryon density of the universe. There is a
sensitive velocity dependence for all mechanisms of baryon production,
depending on the magnitude of velocity of the bubble wall, and we examine in
particular an inverse velocity dependence on baryon production, which is
predicted by the charge transport mechanism of baryon production. For this
mechanism we find both an enhancement of baryon production and the generation
of inhomogeneities during the electro-weak phase transition. We calculate the
magnitude of the baryon enhancement, which can be as large as a few orders of
magnitude, depending on the parameters of the theory, and we calculate the size
and amplitude of the inhomogeneities generated. We determine that the
inhomogeneities generated in a thermally nucleated electro-weak phase
transition are to small to survive diffusive processes and effect the
nucleosynthesis epoch. We also examine the possibility that a phase transition
nucleated by other means, such as by the presence of cosmic strings, may
produce inhomogeneities that could effect

Massive Compact objects in the halo, known as MACHOs, have been postulated as
the origin of a substantial fraction of `dark matter' known to exist in the
haloes of galaxies$^{1,2}$. Paczy\'nski$^3$ has suggested that it might
possible to detect these low-luminosity objects by their potential to act as
gravitational lenses, causing a characteristic brightening when they cross the
path of light from a star in a nearby galaxy. very recently, two groups
reported possible detections of microlensing of stars in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC)$^{4,5}$. Here I show that microlensing by stars within the LMC
itself can account for the observed events. It is further shown that if stars
within the LMC are the lenses, the observed light curve can differ from the
light curve due to a galactic lens even at relatively low magnifications. This
provides a possibility of distinguishing between the galactic lenses and the
LMC lenses. For a given number of monitored stars, the LMC induced events
should be strongly concentrated towards the central region of the LMC, while
the galactic events should be uniformly spread over the whole area of the LMC,
so the two can also be distinguished statistically.

We present results concerning the internal structure and kinematics of disk
galaxies formed in cosmologically motivated simulations. The calculations
include dark matter, gas dynamics, radiative cooling, star formation, supernova
feedback and metal enrichment. The initial model is a rigidly rotating
overdense sphere with a mass of about 8 10^11 Msol which is perturbed by small
scale fluctuations according to a biased CDM power spectrum. Converging, Jeans
unstable and rapidly cooling regions are allowed to form stars. Via supernovae,
metal enriched gas is returned to the interstellar medium. {}From these initial
conditions a galaxy forms which shows the main properties of spiral galaxies: a
rotationally supported exponential disk which consists of young stars with
about solar metallicity, a slowly rotating halo of old metal poor stars, a
bulge of old metal rich stars and a slowly rotating extended halo of dark
matter. Bulge, stellar and dark halo are supported by an anisotropic velocity
dispersion and have a de Vaucouleurs surface density profile. The flattening of
the dark and stellar halo is too large to be explained by rotation only.
Whether the flattening of the bulge is caused by an anisotropic velocity
dispersion or by its rotation cannot be answered, because of the limited
numerical resolution due to gravitational softening. The velocity dispersion
and the thickness of the stellar disk increase with the age of the stars.
Considering only the young stellar component, the disk is cold (sigma=20
km/sec) and thin (z <1 kpc). The dynamical formation process ends after about
4\,Gyr, when

The spectral properties of X--ray radiation produced in a static atmosphere
around a neutron star accreting at very low rates are investigated. Previous
results by Alme \& Wilson (1973) are extended to the range $10^{-7}\leq
L/L_{Edd}\leq 10^{-3}$ to include the typical luminosities, $L\sim
10^{31}-10^{32} \ {\rm ergs\, s^{-1}}$, expected from isolated neutron stars
accreting the interstellar medium. The emergent spectra show an overall
hardening with respect to the blackbody at the neutron star effective
temperature in addition to a significant excess over the Wien tail. The
relevance of present results in connection with the observability of
low--luminosity X--ray sources is briefly discussed.

The presence of unseen halos of ``dark matter'' has long been inferred from
the high rotation speeds of gas and stars in the outer parts of spiral
galaxies$^{1}$. The volume density of this dark matter decreases less quickly
from the galactic center than does that of the luminous mass (such as that in
stars), meaning that the dark matter dominates the mass far from the
center$^{1,2}$. While searching for faint starlight away from the plane of the
edge-on disk galaxy \gal$^{3}$, we have found that the galaxy is surrounded by
a faint luminous halo. The intensity of light from this halo falls less steeply
than any known luminous component of spiral galaxies, but is consistent with
the distribution of dark mass inferred from the galaxy's rotation curve.

We compare the two-year COBE DMR sky maps with the predictions of
cosmological-constant cold dark matter models. Using a Bayesian analysis, we
find that the most likely value of the cosmological constant in such a model is
Lambda = 0. The data set an upper limit on Lambda of 0.78 (0.85) at 90%
confidence, and 0.86 (0.92) at 95% confidence with (without) the quadrupole
anisotropy.

Three molecular clouds have been mapped in the nearby metal-poor dwarf
irregular galaxy NGC 6822 using the Owens Valley Millimeter-Wave
Interferometer. Based on upper limits to the virial masses of the clouds, the
CO-to-H2 conversion factor in NGC 6822 is <2.2+/-1.3 times larger than the
Galactic value. Conversion factors obtained for Galactic molecular clouds,
  NGC 6822, and the SMC are consistent with the variation in the CO-to-H2
conversion factor being linearly proportional to the oxygen abundance of the
galaxy. However, the uncertainties are sufficiently large that equal conversion
factors in NGC 6822 and the Galaxy cannot be ruled out. The gas depletion time
obtained for the HII region Hubble V is comparable to those of giant HII
regions in M33. Thus high-efficiency star formation is not limited to the giant
HII regions seen spiral galaxies, but can also occur in a small group of
relatively low-mass molecular clouds.

We Consider models of thin disks (with and without bulges) in the
Bekenstein-Milgrom formulation of MOND as a modification of Newtonian gravity.
Analytic solutions are found for the full gravitational fields of Kuzmin disks,
and of disk-plus-bulge generalizations of them.
  For all these models a simple algebraic relation between the MOND potential
field and the Newtonian potential holds everywhere outside the disk. We give
exact expressions for the rotation curves for these models. We also find that
the algebraic relation is a very good approximation for exponential disks. The
algebraic relation outside the disk is then extended into the disk to derive an
improved approximation for the MOND rotation curve of disk galaxies that
requires only knowledge of the Newtonian curve and the surface density.

The most simple observed cases of gravitational lensing of distant quasars
and galaxies by galaxies and clusters of galaxies are used to test Einstein's
theory of General Relativity and Newtonian Gravity over galactic and
intergalactic distances. They extend the distance range over which
Newton-Einstein Gravity has been tested by 10 orders of magnitude. Although the
precision of the tests are far from the precision of the solar system tests of
EGR and those from pulsar timing in close binary systems, they confirm quite
accurately the validity of Einstein's General Relativity and its weak field
limit, Newtonian Gravity, over galactic and intergalactic distances and the
existence of large quantities of dark matter in galaxies and clusters of
galaxies. Future observations can improve the accuracy of the tests and reduce
the possibilities for systematic errors.

Fluctuations in the CMB have now been detected over a wide range of angular
scales, and a consistent picture seems to be emerging. The data cannot
currently constrain a large number of cosmological parameters, but it is clear
that there is more information than just the normalization of the models. Here
we use the data to constrain a second parameter, namely the amplitude of the
Doppler peak, using a phenomenological approach to the power spectrum. We find
that the data prefer a peak of height ~3, with a purely flat spectrum ruled out
at the 95%CL. Although there are concerns about possible foregrounds and
non-Gaussian fluctuations, we believe that the existence of a peak at
degree-scales is established by the data. This immediately implies that
reionization was unimportant for the CMB. It also potentially leads to
difficulties for models where the fluctuations were produced by topological
defects. Independent constraints on Omega_B, on the slope n, etc. will need to
wait for further data. At the moment, the simple presence of a Doppler peak
should be seen as strong supporting evidence for standard dark matter-dominated
models with some few percent of baryons at z=1000.

We study the morphology of dark lanes and filaments in the dust-rich galaxy
NGC 253 using an unsharp-masked $B$-band optical photograph. Dust features are
classified as `arcs', which have heights and scale radius of about 100 to 300
pc, connecting two or more dark clouds, and `loops' and `bubbles', which are
developed forms of arcs, expanding into the disk-halo interface. These have
diameters of a few hundred pc to $\sim 1$ kpc. Among the bubbles, we notice a
peculiar round-shaped bubble above the nucleus, which could be a large-diameter
($\sim 300$ pc) supernova remnant exploded in the halo over the nucleus. We
also find `vertical dust streamers', which comprise bunches of narrow filaments
with a thickness of a few tens of pc and are almost perpendicular to the
galactic plane, extending coherently for 1 to 2 kpc toward the halo. Finally,
we note `short vertical dust filaments' (or spicules) are found in the central
region. We interpret these features as due to three-dimensional structures of
gas extending from the disk into the halo. We propose a `boiling disk' model
where the filamentary features are produced by star-forming activity in the
disk as well as the influence of magnetic fluxes. We discuss the implication of
the model for the chemical evolution of the ISM in a galaxy disk.

We have derived a new photographic photometry and proper motions for 20000
stars with completeness to V = 18 in the direction of galactic center at the
intermediate latitude (l = 3 deg,b = 47 deg; alpha(1950)=15h 18m, delta(1950) =
+02deg 16') for a 15.5 sq deg field. The combination of four glass copies of
the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (i.e. POSS 1402 E&O and POSS 1429 E&O) has
been used as a first epoch for proper motion determination. The random error of
the proper motions is approximately 0.''3/cen to V=17. The photometric accuracy
ranges between 0.07 to 0.10 in the V, B and U bands. We stress the importance
of the magnitude and color effects in astrometric surveys of field stars. Using
color-magnitude diagrams of a few cluster member stars, a new distance of
6.9+-0.5 kpc is derived for M5 and 20.3+-0.8 kpc for Pal 5 globular clusters.
This is in good agreement with other determinations. We have analyzed the
components of U+W and V galactic space motions resulting from the accurate
proper motions survey. No dependence with z distance is found in the asymmetric
drift of the thick disk population. New estimates of the parameters of the
velocity ellipsoid have been derived for the thin disk, thick disk and halo
populations of the Galaxy.

We present new estimates of the spatial two-point correlation function of
rich clusters of galaxies selected from the APM Galaxy Survey. We have measured
redshifts for a sample of $364$ clusters out to a depth of $\sim 450\hmpc$. The
clusters have a mean space density of $\bar{n} = 3.4\times 10^{-5}\hmpccc$. The
two-point correlation function, $\xi_{cc}$, for this sample is equal to unity
at a pair-separation of $r_0 = 14.3\pm1.75\hmpc$ (2$\sigma$ errors), consistent
with our earlier results from a smaller sample. The new observations provide an
accurate determination of the shape of $\xi_{cc}$ to pair-separations of about
$50\hmpc$. Our results show that $\xi_{cc}$ has a higher amplitude than
expected according to the standard $\Omega=1$ cold dark matter (CDM) model on
spatial scales $2\simlt s \simlt 50\hmpc$, but are in good agreement with
scale-invariant fluctuations in either a low density CDM model or a critical
density universe made up of a mixture of hot and cold dark matter. Our results
provide strong constraints on so called `co-operative' models of galaxy
formation in which the galaxy formation process introduces large-scale
structure in the galaxy distribution.

We have been doing a photometric and astrometric sample survey programme on
Schmidt plates in a few selected directions in the Galaxy with an aim to study
galactic stellar populations. In order to calibrate Schmidt plates
photometrically, it is necessary to have a number of photometric standards
which cover the entire range of magnitudes to be studied on the plates. As
Schmidt plates cover a wide area of the sky, the standards should also be
spread over the surface of the plate so as to minimise geometrical effects
present on the plate. This paper is first in a series of papers aimed at to
provide photometric standards in the selected galactic directions to be
studied. In this paper we present photometric magnitudes obtained through CCD
observation in the galactic direction (l=170deg, b=45deg) centered at
alpha(2000) = 9h 41m 20s and delta(2000) = +49deg 54' 20'' and covering an area
of 14 sq degs. B and V magnitudes have been obtained for a total of 214 stars
out of which for 73 stars U magnitudes also have been obtained. The magnitude
range covered is 11<V<21 and 0.18<B-V<1.85.

We report the serendipitous discovery of a giant grvitational arc in the
Abell Supplementary cluster S295 during optical follow-up observations of
clusters detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The cluster has a redshift
z=0.3007 and a velocity dispersion of about 900 km/sec. This is the first giant
arc newly found in a ROSAT Survey cluster, indicating the potential advantage
of searching for giant arcs in X-ray selected clusters.

On large scales, the higher order moments of the mass distribution,
$S_J=\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$, e.g., the skewness $S_3$ and kurtosis $S_4$, can
be predicted using non-linear perturbation theory. Comparison of these
predictions with moments of the observed galaxy distribution probes the bias
between galaxies and mass. Applying this method to models with initially
Gaussian fluctuations and power spectra $P(k)$ similar to that of galaxies in
the APM survey, we find that the predicted higher order moments $S_J(R)$ are in
good agreement with those directly inferred from the APM survey {\it in the
absence of bias}. We use this result to place limits on the linear and
non-linear bias parameters. Models in which the extra power observed on large
scales (with respect to standard CDM) is produced by scale-dependent bias match
the APM higher order amplitudes only if non-linear bias (rather than non-linear
gravity) generates the observed higher order moments. When normalized to COBE
DMR, these models are significantly ruled out by the $S_3$ observations. The
cold plus hot dark matter model normalized to COBE can reproduce the APM higher
order correlations if one introduces non-linear bias terms, while the
low-density CDM model with a cosmological constant does not require any bias to
fit the large-scale amplitudes.

We have searched deep optical images of the globular cluster M4 for a
possible optical counterpart for the third body in the PSR B1620-26 system. We
identify as a possible optical counterpart a star located within $0.3''$ of the
nominal pulsar position with $V\approx 20$. This magnitude is consistent with a
main sequence cluster member with $M\approx 0.45M_\odot$. However, this star
may be blended with fainter stars, and the probability of a chance
superposition is non-negligible.

We study the gravitational instability of an isothermal gaseous slab formed
by cloud-cloud collision and compression at the cloud interface. The compressed
gaseous slab rotates and has velocity shear except when the collision is not
exactly head-on. The effects of the rotation and velocity shear on the
gravitational instability have been evaluated for the first time. We obtained
the growth rate of perturbations as a function of the wavelength for various
gaseous slab models. We also obtained the changes in the density and velocity
due to the perturbations. Two types of unstable modes are found; one is due to
the self-gravity of the gaseous slab and the other is due to the velocity
shear. The former instability leads to the formation of star and star clusters.
Velocity shear decreases the growth rate of the former instability while it
increases that of the latter instability. Rotation also decreases the growth of
the former instability. As the slab grows in mass, the growth rate of the
self-gravitational instability increases and eventually becomes greater than
the growing timescale of the slab. Then a gravitationally bound condensation is
formed and its mass is larger when the slab has stronger velocity shear and
rotation.

We provide the mathematical framework which elucidates the way of using a
Tully-Fisher (TF) like relation in the determination of the Hubble constant
$H_0$, as well as for distances of galaxies. The methods related to the
so-called Direct and Inverse TF Relations (herein DTF and ITF) are interpreted
as maximum likelihood statistics. We show that, as long as the same model is
used for the calibration of the TF relation and for the determination of $H_0$,
we obtain a coherent Hubble's constant. The choice of the model is motivated by
reasons of robustness of statistics, it depends on selection effects in
observation which are present in the sample. The difference on the distance
estimates when using either the ITF or the DTF model is only due to random
fluctuations. It is interesting to point out that the DTF estimate does not
depend on the luminosity distribution of sources. Both statistics show a
correction for a bias, inadequately believed to be of Malmquist type. The
repercussion of measurement errors, and additional selection effects are also
analyzed

We analyse the two--dimensional all--sky distribution of rich Abell and ACO
galaxy clusters by using counts in cells and measuring the high--order
area--averaged angular correlation functions. Confirming previous results, we
find a well defined hierarchical relation between the two and three--point
correlation functions, remarkably constant with scale. In the angular range
$2^\circ \le \theta \le 4^\circ$, the southern sample, limited at $b_{II} \le
-40^\circ$ and including both Abell and ACO clusters, shows a remarkable
hierarchical behavior up to the 6th order, while northern Abell clusters give
positive correlations in the same range only up to the 4th order. The inferred
deprojected values of the 3--D coefficients $S_J$, where $S_J = \bar{\xi}_J /
{\bar{\xi}_2}^{J-1}$, are similar to those measured for the galaxy
distribution, and consistent with theoretical predictions. These results are
confirmed to the 4th order by our analysis of a 3--D sample of Abell and ACO
clusters. Assuming that selection effects and / or the absence of a cluster
fair sample are the reason of the difference between the two galactic
hemispheres, and between Abell and ACO clusters, our results indicate that the
statistical properties of the cluster distribution originate from the
underlying galaxy distribution and show that the biasing between clusters and
galaxies is non--linear.

We present the light curve of an unusual variable object, OGLE #7, detected
during the OGLE search for microlensing events. After one season of being in a
low, normal state, the star brightened by more than 2~mag with a characteristic
double-maximum shape, and returned to normal brightness after 60 days. We
consider possible explanations of the photometric behavior of OGLE #7. The
binary microlens model seems to be the most likely explanation -- it reproduces
well the observed light curve and explains the observed colors of OGLE #7. The
characteristic time scale of the OGLE #7 event, $t_E$, is equal to 80 days, the
longest observed to date. The binary microlens model predicts that the spectrum
of the star should be composite, with roughly 50% of its light in the $I$-band
coming from a non-lensed source.

Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) containing bright X sources (L_x > 10^{36}
erg/s), commonly associated with Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs), are found to
be significantly denser and more metal-rich than normal non-X-ray clusters both
in the Galaxy and in M31. Within a framework where LMXBs in GCs are generated
via tidal captures in high-density clusters and (2+1) encounters in low-density
globulars, the higher incidence of LMXBs with increasing metallicity is shown
to be {\it intrinsic} and not just a by-product of other effects. Two possible
mechanisms are examined: the first one assumes a dependence of the cluster IMF
on metallicity as recently published in the literature. The observed LMBXs,
more frequently occurring in metal rich clusters, agrees with the predicted
number of NS only if metallicity accounts for a minor contribution to the
observed variation of the IMF slope. Other alternatives explored, such as the
total variation of the observed IMF slopes is due to (a) just metallicity and
(b) the combination of metallicity and position in the Galaxy lead to a
clear-cut disagreement with the data. The second mechanism assumes that, at
fixed cluster density, the rate of tidal captures depends on radius and mass of
the capturing star. Based on standard stellar models, stars with higher metal
content have wider radii and higher masses, hence the rate of tidal captures
increases with increasing metallicity. From the order of magnitude computations
made, this new effect by itself could explain the observed ratio of 4 between
the frequencies of X-ray clusters in the metal-rich and metal-poor groups we
observationally determined. However, there is no reason to exclude that both
mechanisms can be at work.

The advantages of a near-infrared variant of the Barnes-Evans method for
estimating distances to Cepheid variables are described and quantified. A
surface brightness-color relation for $K$ photometry and the $(V-K)_0$ color
index is established using modern, high-precision angular diameters from
optical interferometers. Applied to data for the galactic (cluster) Cepheid U
Sgr, this method yields a distance of 0.660 $\pm$ 0.024 kpc and a true distance
modulus of 9.10 $\pm$ 0.07 mag. This estimate compares with the true distance
modulus of 9.37 $\pm$ 0.22 mag estimated by Gieren, Barnes, and Moffett (1993)
using the classical Barnes-Evans technique. The possibility of estimating
distances of LMC and SMC Cepheids directly -- without intermediate steps -- is
discussed. The feasibility of determining the distance of M31 or M33 using this
technique is examined and is probably within the reach of 8m-class telescopes.

The Sachs-Wolfe temperature fluctuations produced by primordial density
perturbations are proportional to the potential field \phi, which is a weighted
integral over the density field \delta. Because of the central limit theorem,
\phi can be approximately Gaussian even when \delta is non-Gaussian. Using the
Wold representation for non-Gaussian density fields, \delta(\rvec) = \int
f(|\rvec - \rvec^\prime|) \Delta(\rvec^\prime) d^3 \rvec^\prime, we find
conditions on \Delta and f for which \phi must have a Gaussian one-point
distribution, while \delta can be non-Gaussian. Sufficient (but not necessary)
conditions are that the density field have a power spectrum (which determines
f) of P(k) \propto k^n, with -2 < n \le +1, and that \Delta(\rvec) be
non-Gaussian with no long-range correlations. Thus, there is an infinite set of
non-Gaussian density fields which produce a nearly Gaussian one-point
distribution for the Sachs-Wolfe effect.

We investigate spectral evolution in 37 bright, long gamma-ray bursts
observed with the BATSE Spectroscopy Detectors. High resolution spectra are
characterized by the energy of the peak of \nfn~and the evolution of this
quantity is examined relative to the emission intensity. In most cases it is
found that this peak energy either rises with or slightly precedes major
intensity increases and softens for the remainder of the pulse. Inter-pulse
emission is generally harder early in the burst. For bursts with multiple
intensity pulses, later spikes tend to be softer than earlier ones indicating
that the energy of the peak of \nfn~is bounded by an envelope which decays with
time. Evidence is found that bursts in which the bulk of the flux comes well
after the event which triggers the instrument tend to show less peak energy
variability and are not as hard as several bursts in which the emission occurs
promptly after the trigger. Several recently proposed burst models are examined
in light of these results and no qualitative conflicts with the observations
presented here are found.

The angular two-point correlation function between background QSOs and
foreground galaxies induced by gravitational lensing is derived. It is shown
that the shape of this correlation function depends sensitively on the spectrum
of the density fluctuations in the Universe, thus providing a possibility to
distinguish between different models for the spectrum. Using numerical
large-scale structure simulations, I estimate that the QSO-galaxy correlation
function can be measured from galaxy counts down to $\simeq21^{\rm
st}\ldots22^{\rm nd}$ magnitude in fields with radius $\la25'$ around
$50\ldots100$ QSOs with redshift $z\ge1$. Since the QSO-galaxy correlation
function is proportional to $(-a-1)b$, where $b$ is the biasing factor of
galaxy formation and $a$ is the effective slope of the QSO number counts, steep
number counts are favorable for this kind of analysis. I show that
$a=-4\ldots-5$ can be achieved with the 1-Jansky sample of radio-loud QSOs when
the double-waveband magnification bias is employed. Moreover, the
cross-correlation analysis allows to determine the galaxy-formation bias factor
$b$.

We discovered a periodicity at about 8.7s from the X--ray sources 4U0142+61,
previously considered a possible black hole candidate on the basis of its
ultrasoft spectrum. The pulsations are visible only in the 1--4 keV energy
range, during an observation obtained with the EXOSAT satellite in August 1984.
A search for delays in the pulse arrival times caused by orbital motion gave
negative results. In the same data, periodic oscillations at 25 minutes had
been previously found in an additional hard spectral component dominating above
4 keV which arises from the X-ray transient RX J0146.9+6121, discovered with
ROSAT and identified with a Be star. Though the very high (>10^4) X--ray to
optical flux ratio of 4U0142+61 is compatible with models based on an isolated
neutron star, the simplest explanation involves a low mass X--ray binary with a
very faint companion, similar to 4U1626--67. The discovery of periodic
pulsations from 4U0142+61 weakens the phenomenological criterion that an
ultrasoft spectral component is a signature of accreting black holes.

We introduce a simple yet powerful {\it analytic} method which obtains the
structure of cosmic microwave background anisotropies to better than 5-10\% in
temperature fluctuations on {\it all} scales. It is applicable to {\it any}
model in which the potential fluctuations at recombination are both linear and
known. Moreover, it recovers and explains the presence of the ``Doppler peaks''
at degree scales as {\it driven} acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon
fluid. We treat in detail such subtleties as the time dependence of the
gravitational driving force, anisotropic stress from the neutrino quadrupole,
and damping during the recombination process, again all from an analytic
standpoint. We apply this formalism to the standard cold dark matter model to
gain physical insight into the anisotropies, including the dependence of the
peak locations and heights on cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_b$ and
$h$, as well as model parameters such as the ionization history. Damping due to
the finite thickness of the last scattering surface and photon diffusion are
further more shown to be identical. In addition to being a powerful probe into
the nature of anisotropies, this treatment can be used in place of the standard
Boltzmann code where 5-10\% accuracy in temperature fluctuations is
satisfactory and/or speed is essential. Equally importantly, it can be used as
a portable standard by which numerical codes can be tested and compared.

We present further photometric observations of the unusual F0 V star 9
Aurigae and present evidence that this star's radial velocity, spectroscopic
line widths and line depths are also variable with the same frequencies as the
photometric data ($f_1 \approx 0.795$ and $f_2 \approx 0.345$ d$^{-1}$). The
phases of these sinusoids are stable over time scales of longer than one year,
though the amplitudes can vary, making the prediction of photometric behavior
impossible. Given that a variety of other explanations have already been
discounted (e.g. interactions with a close companion, the existence of a lumpy,
orbiting ring of dust, or star spots) and that these variations occur on time
scales an order of magnitude slower than the fundamental radial pulsation
period, we have very strong evidence that 9 Aurigae exhibits non-radial {\it
g}-mode pulsations. Since the power spectrum of the radial velocity data shows
frequency $f_2$ but does not clearly show $f_1$, the present data suggest that
$f_2$ is associated with a low degree spherical harmonic ($\ell$ = 1 or 2),
while $f_1$ is associated with a higher degree harmonic. 9 Aurigae, along with
such stars as $\gamma$ Doradus, HD 224638, HD 224945, and HD 164615, appear to
constitute a new class of pulsating variables. These stars are to be found at
or beyond the cool edge of the Cepheid instability strip in the HR Diagram.
Prior to this, only much hotter stars have been shown to exhibit non-radial
{\it g}-modes.

An attractive and simple hypothesis for the formation of large-scale
structure is that it developed by gravitational instability from primordial
fluctuations with an initially Gaussian probability distribution. Non-linear
gravitational evolution drives the distribution away from the Gaussian form,
generating measurable skewness and kurtosis even when the variance of the
fluctuations is much smaller than unity. We use perturbation theory to compute
the kurtosis of the mass density field and the velocity divergence field that
arises during the weakly non-linear evolution of initially Gaussian
fluctuations. We adopt an Einstein--de~Sitter universe for the perturbative
calculations, and we discuss the generalization to a universe of arbitrary
$\Omega$. We obtain semi-analytic results for the case of scale-free, power-law
spectra of the initial fluctuations and final smoothing of cosmic fields with a
Gaussian filter. We also give an exact analytical formula for the dependence of
the skewness of these fields on the power spectrum index. We show that the
kurtosis decreases with the power spectrum index, and we compare our more
accurate results for the kurtosis to previous estimates from Monte Carlo
integrations. We also compare our results to values obtained from cosmological
N-body simulations with power-law initial spectra. Measurements of the skewness
and kurtosis parameters can be used to test the hypothesis that structure in
the universe formed by gravitational instability from Gaussian initial
conditions.

The microlensing of background stars by compact objects in globular clusters
is analyzed. The main strength of the proposed search is the direct
relationship between the lens mass and the time scale of the microlensing
event. The main problem is the low overall rate of expected events which
implies that a ground based search should last for about a decade to generate a
non trivial number of events, like a few dozen. A space borne experiment could
increase the rate by a large factor by increasing the number of stars which
could be monitored thanks to the much better seeing. The clusters M22 with the
galactic bulge background, and 47 Tuc with the SMC background, are the two
examples of possible targets.

We have obtained photometry and spectra of SN~1991T which extend more than
1000 days past maximum light, by far the longest a SN~Ia has been followed.
Although SN~1991T exhibited nearly normal photometric behavior in the first 400
days following maximum, by 600 days its decline had slowed, and by 950~days the
supernova brightness was consistent with a constant apparent magnitude of
$m_B=21.30$. Spectra near maximum showed minor variations on the SN~Ia theme
which grew less conspicuous during the exponential decline. At 270 days the
nebular spectrum was composed of Fe and Co lines common to SNe~Ia. However, by
750 days past maximum light, these lines had shifted in wavelength, and were
superimposed on a strong blue continuum. The luminosity of SN~1991T at 950 days
is more than $9.0\times10^{38}(D/13~{\rm Mpc})^2$~ergs~s$^{-1}$ with a rate of
decline of less than $0.04$ mags/100~days. We show that this emission is likely
to be light that was emitted by SN~1991T near maximum light which has reflected
from foreground dust, much like the light echos observed around SN~1987A.

We have used observations gathered at CTIO to measure distances by the
Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to 5 Type II supernovae. These supernovae
lie at redshifts from cz = 1100 km/s to z = 5500 km/s, and increase to 18 the
number of distances measured using EPM. We compare distances derived to 11 Type
II supernovae with distances to their host galaxies measured using the
Tully-Fisher method. We find that the Tully-Fisher distances average 11%+-7%
smaller. The comparison shows no significant evidence of any large
distance-dependent bias in the Tully-Fisher distances. We employ the sample of
EPM distances from 4.5~Mpc to 180~Mpc to derive a value for the Hubble
Constant. We find H_0 = 73 +- 6 (statistical) +- 7 (systematic}) km/s/Mpc.

The observed B/Be ratio in extreme Pop II stars has been interpreted as
evidence of Be and B synthesis by early galactic cosmic rays. However, a recent
reanalysis of the boron abundance in the Pop II halo star HD140283 suggests
that B/H may be larger than previously reported, by as much as a factor of 4.
This would yield a B/Be ratio lying in the range $14 \la {\rm B/Be} \la 50$.
The possibility of a high Pop II B/Be ratio stresses the importance of the
upper limit to the B/Be ratio arising from cosmic ray production. It is found
that the limit to cosmic ray-produced B/Be depends upon the assumed cosmic ray
spectrum. For any Pop II comic ray spectrum that is a single power law in
either total energy per nucleon or in momentum the B/Be ratio is constrained to
lie in the range $7.6 \la$ B/Be $\la 14$. Thus, if the new B/Be ratio is
correct, it requires either a bimodal cosmic ray flux with a large low energy
component, or for another B source, possibly the proposed $\nu$-process in
supernovae, either of which may be helpful in explaining the observed
\bor11/\bor10 ratio. Finally, it is noted that the boron reanalysis highlights
the uncertainty in our knowledge of the B/Be ratio, and the need for additional
data on Be and B abundances.

We present a method for deriving a smoothed estimate of the peculiar velocity
field of a set of galaxies with measured circular velocities $\eta\equiv {\rm
log} \Delta v$ and apparent magnitudes $m$. The method is based on minimizing
the scatter of a linear inverse Tully-Fisher relation $\eta= \eta(M)$ where the
absolute magnitude of each galaxy is inferred from its redshift $z$, corrected
by a peculiar velocity field, $M \propto m - 5\log(z-u)$. We describe the
radial peculiar velocity field $u({\bf z})$ in terms of a set of orthogonal
functions which can be derived from any convenient basis set; as an example we
take them to be linear combinations of low order spherical harmonic and
spherical Bessel functions. The model parameters are then found by maximizing
the likelihood function for measuring a set of observed $\eta$. The predicted
peculiar velocities are free of Malmquist bias in the absence of
multi-streaming, provided no selection criteria are imposed on the measurement
of circular velocities. This procedure can be considered as a generalized
smoothing algorithm of the peculiar velocity field, and is particularly useful
for comparison to the smoothed gravity field derived from full-sky galaxy
redshift catalogs such as the IRAS surveys. We demonstrate the technique using
a catalog of ``galaxies" derived from an N-body simulation. Increasing the
resolution of the velocity smoothing beyond a certain level degrades the
correlation of fitted velocities against the velocities calculated from linear
theory methods, which have finite resolution,

The polarization of the CMB offers a potentially valuable probe of the
physics of the early universe, specifically of the velocity of the
photon-baryon fluid on the last scattering surface. Here we discuss
qualitatively the correlations that arise between the temperature anisotropies
and polarization of the CMB and how they might be observed.

The observations of all three COBE instruments are examined for the effects
of dark matter. The anisotropy measured by the DMR, and especially the
degree-scale ground- and balloon-based experiments, is only compatible with
large-scale structure formation by gravity if the Universe is dominated by
non-baryonic dark matter. The FIRAS instrument measures the total power
radiated by cold dust, and thus places tight limits on the absorption of
starlight by very cold gas and dust in the outer Milky Way. The DIRBE
instrument measures the infrared background, and will place tight limits on the
emission by low mass stars in the Galactic halo.

The index $n$ of a power law power spectrum of primordial density
fluctuations, $P(k) \propto k^n$, has been estimated using many different
techniques. The most precise compare the COBE DMR large angular scale $\Delta
T$ to the amplitude of the large scale structure, but these are also the most
model-dependent. The COBE DMR $\Delta T$ has also been compared to the
degree-scale $\Delta T$ from several experiments. And finally, a relatively
model-independent value of $n$ can derived from the COBE data alone, but the
small range of angular scales covered by COBE limits the precision of these
methods.

I derive a general expression for the optical depth $\tau$ for gravitational
lensing of stars in a disk by Massive Compact Objects (Machos) in the same
disk. For the more restricted case where the disk is self-gravitating and the
stars and Machos have the same distribution function, I find $\tau =
2\VEV{v^2}/c^2\sec^2 i$ where $\VEV{v^2}$ is the mass-weighted vertical
velocity dispersion, and $i$ is the angle of inclination. This result does not
depend on any assumptions about the velocity distribution. As an example, if
stars within the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) account for the
observed optical depth $\tau\sim 8\times 10^{-8}$ as has recently been
suggested, then $v\gsim 60\,\kms$. This is substantially larger than the
measured dispersions of known LMC populations.

The recent development of unified theories of active galactic nuclei (AGN)
has indicated that there are two physically distinct classes of these objects -
radio-loud and radio-quiet. The primary observational distinctions between the
two types are: (1) The radio-loud objects produce large scale radio jets and
lobes, with the kinetic power of the jets being a significant fraction of the
total bolometric luminosity. On the other hand, the weak radio ejecta of the
radio-quiet objects are energetically insignificant. (2) The radio-loud objects
are associated with elliptical galaxies which have undergone recent mergers,
while the radio-quiets prefer spiral hosts. (3) The space density of the
radio-louds at a given optical luminosity is $\approx$ 10 times lower than that
of the radio-quiets. Despite these differences, the (probably) thermal
emissions from the AGN (continua and lines from X-ray to infrared wavelengths)
are quite similar in the two classes of object. We argue that this last result
suggests that the black hole masses and mass accretion rates in the two classes
are not greatly different, and that the difference between the classes is
associated with the spin of the black hole.
  We assume that the normal process of accretion through a disk does not lead
to rapidly spinning holes, and propose instead that galaxies (e.g. spirals)
which have not suffered a recent major merger event contain non-rotating or
only slowly rotating black holes. When two such galaxies merge, the two black
holes are known to form a binary and we assume that they eventually coalesce.
In the small fraction of mergers in which the two ``parent'' galaxies contain
very massive holes of roughly equal mass, a rapidly spinning, very massive hole
results. It is proposed that such mergers are the progenitors of powerful radio

Abundance patterns of the elements C, N, and O are sensitive probes of
stellar nucleosynthesis processes and, in addition, O abundances are an
important input for stellar age determinations. Understanding the nature of the
observed distribution of these elements is key to constraining protogalactic
star formation history. Patterns deduced from low-resolution spectroscopy of
the CN, CH, NH, and CO molecules for low-mass stars in their core-hydrogen or
first shell-hydrogen burning phases in the oldest ensembles known, the Galactic
globular star clusters, are reviewed. New results for faint stars in NGC 104
(47 Tuc, C0021-723) reveal that the bimodal, anticorrelated pattern of CN and
CH strengths found among luminous evolved stars is also present in stars
nearing the end of their main-sequence lifetimes. In the absence of known
mechanisms to mix newly synthesized elements from the interior to the
observable surface layers of such unevolved stars, those particular
inhomogeneities imply that the original material from which the stars formed
some 15 billion years ago was chemically inhomogeneous in the C and N elements.
However, in other clusters, observations of abundance ratios and C isotope
ratios suggest that alterations to surface chemical compositions are produced
as stars evolve from the main sequence through the red giant branch. Thus, the
current observed distributions of C, N, and O among the brightest stars (those
also observed most often) may not reflect the true distribution from which the
protocluster cloud formed. The picture which is emerging of the C, N and O
abundance patterns within globular clusters may be one which

The recent discovery that faint gamma-ray bursts are stretched in time
relative to bright ones has been interpreted as support for cosmological
distances: faint bursts have their durations redshifted relative to bright
ones. It was pointed out, however, that the relative time stretching can also
be produced by an intrinsic correlation between duration and luminosity of
gamma-ray bursts in a nearby, bounded distribution. While both models can
explain the average amount of time stretching, we find a difference between
them in the way the duration distribution of faint bursts deviates from that of
bright ones, assuming the luminosity function of gamma-ray bursts is
independent of distance. This allows us to distinguish between these two broad
classes of model on the basis of the duration distributions of gamma-ray
bursts, leading perhaps to an unambiguous determination of the distance scale
of gamma-ray bursts. We apply our proposed test to the second BATSE catalog and
conclude, with some caution, that the data favor a cosmological interpretation
of the time dilation.

We examine the width of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) luminosity function through
the distribution of GRB peak count rates, C$_{\rm{peak}}$, as detected by BATSE
(\cite{batse:93}). In the context of galactic corona spatial distribution
models, we attempt to place constraints on the characteristic width of the
luminosity function by comparing the observed intensity distribution with those
produced by a range of density and luminosity functions. We find that the
intrinsic width of the luminosity function cannot be very well restricted.
However, the distribution of intrinsic luminosities of {\it detected bursts}
can be limited: we find that most observed bursts have luminosities that are in
a range of one to two decades, but a significant population of undetected less
luminous bursts cannot be excluded. These findings demonstrate that the
assumption that GRB are standard candles is sufficient but not necessary to
explain the observed intensity distribution. We show that the main reason for
the relatively poor constraints is the fact that the bright-end part of the GRB
flux distribution is not yet sampled by BATSE, and better sampling in the
future may lead to significantly stronger constraints on the width of the
luminosity function.

Using the simulation of Katz & White we have tested the viability of X-ray
analysis for constraining the intrinsic shapes of clusters of galaxies
considering the effects of both substructure and steep temperature gradients.
We restrict analysis to aggregate cluster shapes on scales of $r\sim 1-2$ Mpc
to reduce our sensitivity to core subclustering. For low redshifts $(z\lesssim
0.25)$ the X-ray method accurately measures the true ellipticity of the
three-dimensional cluster dark matter; assuming the gas is isothermal adds only
small errors. At higher redshifts the X-ray method yields unreliable results
since the gas does not trace the cluster gravitational potential. We proffer
necessary conditions for the reliability of X-ray methods characterized by the
amount of substructure in the X-ray surface brightness images and the isophotal
shapes. We conclude that measurements of aggregate cluster shapes on scales
$r\sim 1-2$ Mpc are insensitive to core substructure on scales of a few hundred
kpc. Therefore our results suggest that the X-ray measurements of aggregate
cluster shapes by Fabricant, Rybicki, & Gorenstein and Buote & Canizares are
valid provided that they do not suffer from serious projection effects. A
substantial number of Abell clusters observed with the ROSAT PSPC will be
amenable to X-ray shape analysis.

High-resolution near-infrared images and moderate resolution spectra were
obtained of the bipolar nebulae M~2--9 and AFGL 2688. The ability to spatially
and spectrally resolve the various components of the nebulae has proved to be
important in determining their physical structure and characteristics. In
M~2--9, the lobes are found to have a double-shell structure. Analysis of \h2\
line ratios indicates that the \h2\ emission is radiatively excited. A
well-resolved photodissociation region is observed in the lobes. The spectrum
of the central source is dominated by H recombination lines and a strong
continuum rising towards longer wavelengths consistent with a $T = 795$ K
blackbody. In AFGL 2688, the emission from the bright lobes is mainly continuum
reflected from the central star. Several molecular features from C$_2$ and CN
are present. In the extreme end of the N lobe and in the E equatorial region,
the emission is dominated by lines of \h2 in the 2--2.5 \microns region. The
observed \h2 line ratios indicate that the emission is collisionally excited,
with an excitation temperature $T_{ex} \approx 1600\pm 100$ K.

When a magnetised, thermal plasma containing a shock wave efficiently
accelerates Cosmic Rays (CR) a reaction is exerted on the fluid structure. The
simplest description of this process involves three conservation equations for
the background fluid, with the CR pressure gradient included as an extra force,
plus a hydrodynamic equation for the CR energy density. Since the CR spectrum
is not determined in this approach two quantities are introduced, the ratio of
CR pressure to energy density and a mean diffusion coefficient, that must be
specified to close the system of equations. Physical arguments are presented
for how these quantities should evolve and then compared with time dependent
numerical solutions of acceleration at a plane parallel, piston driven shock.

We analyse the propagation of particles in the narrow funnel of a thick
accretion disk. It is assumed that: (1) the funnel walls emit black body
radiation with temperature decreasing outwards; (2) the magnetic and electric
fields are longitudinal in the funnel. Such a scenario is consistent with
models in which a large potential drop is induced by a rotating massive black
hole threaded by a magnetic field (Blandford & Znajek 1977, Macdonald & Thorne
1982). The interaction of relativistic protons with thermal photons from the
funnel results in direct production of pairs and/or pions. We discuss the
relative importance of these processes for different conditions in the funnel
(temperature and electric field profiles). Injected pairs interact with thermal
photons in the Thomson or Klein-Nishina regime. Under some conditions, a pair
avalanche results, which we assume saturates in the production of stable
bunches, containing almost equal numbers of electrons and positrons. As a
consequence, highly collimated gamma-ray photons are produced. We obtain
gamma-ray spectra from our model in order to test its applicability to the
gamma-ray emitting AGNs recently reported by EGRET.

After a recall of fundamental concepts used in galactic dynamics, we review
observational facts as well as results of orbit theory and numerical
simulations which suggest long-term evolution of galaxies. Dynamical
interactions between galaxy constituents (bulges, disks, bars, haloes, dark
matter) are discussed and effects of external perturbations on internal
structures are examined. We report recent developments on the connection
between dynamical interaction processes and efficiency of star formation in
galaxies of various morphological types. The Hubble sequence as an evolution
sequence is revisited.

The meaning of the inflationary slow-roll approximation is formalised.
Comparisons are made between an approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi
equations, governing the evolution of the Hubble parameter, and the usual
scenario based on the evolution of the potential energy density. The vital role
of the inflationary attractor solution is emphasised, and some of its
properties described. We propose a new measure of inflation, based upon
contraction of the comoving Hubble length as opposed to the usual e-foldings of
physical expansion, and derive relevant formulae. We introduce an infinite
hierarchy of slow-roll parameters, and show that only a finite number of them
are required to produce results to a given order. The extension of the
slow-roll approximation into an analytic slow-roll expansion, converging on the
exact solution, is provided. Its role in calculations of inflationary dynamics
is discussed. We explore rational-approximants as a method of extending the
range of convergence of the slow-roll expansion up to, and beyond, the end of
inflation.

The andante regime of scalar field dynamics in the chaotic inflationary
Universe is defined as the epoch when the field is rolling moderately slowly
down its interaction potential, but at such a rate that first-order corrections
to the slow-roll approximation become important. These conditions should apply
towards the end of inflation as the field approaches the global minimum of the
potential. Solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations for the class of
power law potentials $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{2n}$ are found in this regime in
terms of the inverse error function.

We analyse the large--scale velocity field obtained by N--body simulations of
cold dark matter (CDM) models with non--Gaussian primordial density
fluctuations, considering models with both positive and negative primordial
skewness in the density fluctuation distribution. We study the velocity
probability distribution and calculate the dependence of the bulk flow,
one--point velocity dispersion and Cosmic Mach Number on the filtering size. We
find that the sign of the primordial skewness of the density field provides
poor discriminatory power on the evolved velocity field. All non--Gaussian
models here considered tend to have lower velocity dispersion and bulk flow
than the standard Gaussian CDM model, while the Cosmic Mach Number turns out to
be a poor statistic in characterizing the models. Next, we compare the
large--scale velocity field of a composite sample of optically selected
galaxies as described by the Local Group properties, bulk flow, velocity
correlation function and Cosmic Mach Number, with the velocity field of mock
catalogues extracted from the N--body simulations. The comparison does not
clearly permit to single out a best model: the standard Gaussian model is
however marginally preferred by the maximum likelihood analysis.

This paper considers the hypothesis that BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) are the
beamed remnants of Quasi Stellar Objects. The hypothesis explains why BLLs do
not undergo the strong evolution seen in other active galactic nuclei since it
naturally predicts that the space density of BLLs should increase with cosmic
time, as shown by recent observations. Numerical models reproduce, with
reasonable parameters, the known redshift and magnitude counts of BL Lac
objects. It is assumed that radio-quiet as well as radio-loud quasars are
capable of generating jets but that jets are snuffed in young radio-quiet
objects and only emerge in aged ones. I argue that the observations allow this
assumption.

We present sensitive upper limits on the 90 GHz flux of known radio and
infrared sources in regions associated with possible cosmic microwave
background fluctuations at 0.5--1 degree scales. Specifically we look at the
MAX GUM region and the region of strongest fluctuation in the MSAM scan. None
of the known sources can account for the levels of anisotropy seen.

Spin vectors of 60 galaxies in the ``Ursa Major Filament'' are obtained from
CCD images and spectroscopic determinations of the directions of rotation.
These data are used to remove the four-fold degeneracy introduced by the
project ed images of galaxies, making possible the complete reconstruction of
the galaxy spin vectors. Several possible organizations of spin vectors are
investigated by means of statistical analyses of the three-dimensional spin
vector maps. The results indicate that there exists no significant alignment of
galaxy spin vectors with respect to the supergalactic plane, the supergalactic
axis, or the cylindrical axis of the filament itself. No tendency for linear
alignment of spin vectors towards any specific direction was detected. We also
obtain a statistically negative result for azimuthal, radial, and circul
ar-helical orientation of spin vectors.

We describe a family of circular, and elliptical, finite disks with a disk
potential that is a power of the radius. These are all flattened ellipsoids,
obtained by squashing finite spheres with a power-law density distribution, and
cutoff at some radius Ro. First we discuss circular disks whose circular
rotation speed v is proportional to r^alpha, with any alpha> -1/2. The
surface-density of the disks is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions
of 1-(Ro/r)^2.
  We give closed expressions for the full 3-D potentials in terms of
hypergeometric functions of two variables. We express the potential and
acceleration in the plane at r>Ro, and along the rotation axis, in terms of
simple hypergeometric functions. All the multipoles of the disk are given. We
then generalize to non-axisymmetric disks. The potential in the midplane is
given in terms of the hypergeometric function of two variables. For integer
values of 2 alpha the above quantities are given in more elementary terms. All
these results follow straightforwardly from formulae we derive for the general,
cutoff, power-law, triaxial ellipsoid.

The discoveries of 17 microlensing event candidates have been reported over
the last year by three teams conducting unprecedented mass photometric searches
in the direction of the Galactic bulge and the Magellanic Clouds. These include
10 events found by the OGLE collaboration, 5 by the MACHO team and 2 by the
EROS team. All searches have the main goal to detect dark matter in our Galaxy.
The detection of 17 event candidates proves that the microlensing is a powerful
tool in the search for dark matter, and it may be used for reliable mass
determination when the geometry of the event is known. Here we present the
first microlensing event, OGLE~\#11, discovered in real time, using the newly
implemented "Early Warning System". We describe our system which makes it
possible to monitor and study in great details any very rare phenomena, not
only lensing events, with a broad array of instruments almost immediately after
they have changed their brightness.

In this paper the concept of tomography of a collisionless stellar system of
general shape is introduced, and a generalization of the Projected Virial
Theorem is obtained. Applying the tomographic procedure we then derive a new
family of virial equations which coincides with the already known ones for
spherically symmetric systems. This result is obtained without any use of
explicit expressions for the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, or spherical
coordinate system.

We use numerical simulations of critically-closed cold dark matter (CDM)
models to study the effects of numerical resolution on observable quantities.
We study simulations with up to $256^3$ particles using the particle-mesh (PM)
method and with up to $144^3$ particles using the adaptive particle-particle
--particle-mesh (P$^3$M) method. Comparisons of galaxy halo distributions are
made among the various simulations. We also compare distributions with
observations and we explore methods for identifying halos, including a new
algorithm that finds all particles within closed contours of the smoothed
density field surrounding a peak. The simulated halos show more substructure
than predicted by the Press-Schechter theory. We are able to rule out all
$\Omega=1$ CDM models for linear amplitude $\sigma_8\gsim 0.5$ because the
simulations produce too many massive halos compared with the observations. The
simulations also produce too many low mass halos. The distribution of halos
characterized by their circular velocities for the P$^3$M simulations is in
reasonable agreement with the observations for $150\kms\lsim V_{\rm circ} \lsim
350\kms$.}}

We examine high-resolution gravitational N-body simulations of the $\Omega=1$
cold dark matter (CDM) model in order to determine whether there is any
normalization of the initial density fluctuation spectrum that yields
acceptable results for galaxy clustering and velocities. Dense dark matter
halos in the evolved mass distribution are identified with luminous galaxies;
the most massive halos are also considered as sites for galaxy groups, with a
range of possibilities explored for the group mass to light ratios. We verify
the earlier conclusions of White et al. (1987) for the low amplitude (high
bias) CDM model --- the galaxy correlation function is marginally acceptable
but that there are too many galaxies. We also show that the peak biasing method
does not accurately reproduce the results obtained using dense halos identified
in the simulations themselves. The COBE anisotropy implies a higher
normalization, resulting in problems with excessive pairwise galaxy velocity
dispersion unless a strong velocity bias is present. Although we confirm the
strong velocity bias of halos reported by Couchman \& Carlberg (1992), we show
that the galaxy motions are still too large on small scales. We find no
amplitude for which the CDM model can reconcile simultaneously the galaxy
correlation function, the low pairwise velocity dispersion, and the richness
distribution of groups and clusters. With the normalization implied by COBE,
the CDM spectrum has too much power on small scales if $\Omega=1$.

We discuss statistical techniques for detecting and quantifying bimodality in
astronomical datasets. We concentrate on the KMM algorithm, which estimates the
statistical significance of bimodality in such datasets and objectively
partitions data into sub-populations. By simulating bimodal distributions with
a range of properties we investigate the sensitivity of KMM to datasets with
varying characteristics. Our results facilitate the planning of optimal
observing strategies for systems where bimodality is suspected.
Mixture-modeling algorithms similar to the KMM algorithm have been used in
previous studies to partition the stellar population of the Milky Way into
subsystems. We illustrate the broad applicability of KMM by analysing published
data on globular cluster metallicity distributions, velocity distributions of
galaxies in clusters, and burst durations of gamma-ray sources. PostScript
versions of the tables and figures, as well as FORTRAN code for KMM and
instructions for its use, are available by anonymous ftp from
kula.phsx.ukans.edu.

We have conducted a galaxy survey based on low-resolution slitless spectra
taken from the automated CFHT-Laval survey. We present redshift distributions
for 522 galaxies distributed in 4 distinct regions of the sky. Redshifts are
determined from the shifted positions of the 4000 A. stellar break using an
automated break-finding algorithm. The redshifts so obtained have a precision
of < 3000 km s-1, good enough to trace the large-scale distribution of
galaxies. The most striking feature of the survey is an apparent excess of
galaxies at z ~ 0.1 in 8 of the 10 fields probed. Although the statistical
significance of the peaks appears marginal (~ 2.5s per field) after taken in
account the small-scale galaxy clustering, the peaks may nevertheless reveal
the existence of large-scale structures at z ~ 0.1, indicating that the known
large structures in the local universe are not unusual.

Massive Compact Objects (Machos) are currently being discovered at
substantially higher rates than would be expected from standard models of known
stellar populations. To determine whether they are due to non-standard distri-
butions of known populations or to a heretofore unknown (`dark') population,
one must acquire more information about the individual events. Space-based
parallaxes are potentially the best tool for extracting additional information.
To leading order, parallax measurements by a single satellite result in a four-
fold degeneracy: two possible values of $\tilde v$ and two possible signs for
the component of motion perpendicular to the projected satellite-Earth vector.
It had been believed that a second satellite would be required to break this
degeneracy. I show that the velocity difference between the satellite and the
Earth allows one to partially or totally break the degeneracy using a single
satellite. For most Macho events it is possible to measure $\tilde v$ and
$\tilde r_e$. For some it is also possible to measure $\Phi$. The proposed
Space Infrared Telescope could measure $\sim 100$ parallaxes per year by
applying $\sim 400\,$hr of telescope time.

Observations of CN and CH band strengths among a random sample of
main-sequence turn-off stars (+3.9 < MV < +4.6) in the globular cluster 47 Tuc
(NGC 104, C0021-723) were made with the CTIO Argus fiber spectrograph for the
purpose of determining the ratio of CN-strong to CN-weak stars and
investigating the behavior of CH relative to CN. Of the 20 turn-off stars, 12
were found to be CN-strong while 8 appear to be CN-weak. This ratio of
CN-strong to CN-weak stars is similar to the ratios found among the more
luminous 47 Tuc stars and implies little change in the overall distribution of
CN with evolutionary state, although the present sample size is small. A
general anticorrelation between CN and CH is also observed in that the CN-weak
main-sequence stars all (with one possible exception) exhibit strong CH bands -
a trend similar to that found among the brighter stars. That these variations
occur among such relatively un-evolved stars and that the overall CN
distribution appears to be independent of evolutionary state presents serious
challenges to internal or mixing theories of their origin. We therefore suggest
that at least some component of the C and N abundance inhomogeneities observed
among the brighter (more evolved) stars of this cluster appears to have been
established prior to the commencement of evolution up the red giant branch.

The properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation provide unique
constraints on cosmological models, i.e. on the content, history, and evolution
of the Universe. I discuss the latest measurements of the spectral and spatial
properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Recent measurements
from NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, and from balloon-borne
and ground-based platforms, are summarized and their cosmological implications
are discussed.

We have simulated full-sky maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropy expected from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models at 0.5 and 1.0 degree
angular resolution. Statistical properties of the maps are presented as a
function of sky coverage, angular resolution, and instrument noise, and the
implications of these results for observability of the Doppler peak are
discussed. The rms fluctuations in a map are not a particularly robust probe of
the existence of a Doppler peak, however, a full correlation analysis can
provide reasonable sensitivity. We find that sensitivity to the Doppler peak
depends primarily on the fraction of sky covered, and only secondarily on the
angular resolution and noise level. Color plates and one-dimensional scans of
the maps are presented to visually illustrate the anisotropies.

High-contrast peaks in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy can
appear as unresolved sources to observers. We fit simulated CMB maps generated
with a cold dark matter model to a set of unresolved features at instrumental
resolution 0.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees and present the integral density per
steradian n(>|T|) of unresolved features brighter than threshold temperature
|T|. A typical medium-scale experiment observing 0.001 sr at 0.5 degree
resolution would expect to observe one unresolved feature brighter than 85 \muK
after convolution with the beam profile, with less than 5% probability to
observe a source brighter than 150 \muK. Increasing the power-law index of
primordial density perturbations n from 1 to 1.5 raises these temperature
limits |T| by a factor of 2. The results are only weakly dependent on the
assumed values of the Hubble constant and baryon density.

We present a radiative-transfer calculation which reproduces the infrared
spectrum of the planetary nebula BD~+30$^{\circ}$3639. We calculate the
transfer process through absorption and scattering in a spherical-symmetric
multi-grain dust shell. The emission of transiently heated particles is taken
into account, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We obtain an
acceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the PAH infrared bands. At
submillimetre wavelengths the observed emission is larger than the model
predicts, indicating that large dust conglomerates (``f{}luffy grains'') may be
needed as an additional constituent. The fit favours a distance of $\ge 2
\,$kpc, which implies that BD~+30$^\circ$3639 has evolved from a massive
progenitor of several solar masses. A low dust-to-gas mass ratio is found in
the ionised region. The calculations yield an original mass-loss rate of
$2\times10^{-4} \msolar \peryr$ on the Asymptotic Giant Branch. Using this
mass-loss rate, we calculate how the infrared spectrum has evolved during the
post-AGB evolution. We show in particular the evolution of the IRAS colours
during the preceding post-AGB evolution.

We extend the approximate radiative transfer analysis of Hershkowitz, Linder,
and Wagoner (1986) to a more general class of supernova model atmospheres,
using a simple fit to the effective continuum opacity produced by lines
(Wagoner, Perez, and Vasu 1991). At the low densities considered, the
populations of the excited states of hydrogen are governed mainly by
photoionization and recombination, and scattering dominates absorptive opacity.
We match the asymptotic expressions for the spectral energy density $\Jnu$ at
the photosphere, whose location at each frequency is determined by a
first-order calculation of the deviation of $\Jnu$ from the Planck function
$\Bnu$. The emergent spectral luminosity then assumes the form $ L_\nu = 4\pi^2
\r*^2 \zeta^2 \Bnu(T_p) $, where $T_p(\nu)$ is the photospheric temperature,
$\zeta$ is the dilution factor, and $\r*$ is a fiducial radius [ultimately
taken to be the photospheric radius $r_p (\nu)$]. The atmosphere is
characterized by an effective temperature $T_e$ ($\propto L^{1/4} r_*^{-1/2}$)
and hydrogen density $n_H=n_* (r_*/r)^\alpha$ ; and less strongly by the heavy
element abundance and velocity gradient. Our major result is the dependence of
$\zeta$ on frequency $\nu$ and the parameters $T_p$, $r_p$, and $\alpha$.

We develop an analytical theory of reconnection between colliding, twisted
magnetic flux tubes. Our analysis is restricted to direct collisions between
parallel tubes and is based on the collision dynamics worked out by Bogdan
(1984). We show that there is a range of collision velocities for which neutral
point reconnection of the Parker-Sweet type can occur, and a smaller range for
which reconnection leads to coalescence. Mean velocities within the solar
convection zone are probably significantly greater than the upper limit for
coalescence. This suggests that the majority of flux tube collisions do not
result in merging, unless the frictional coupling of the tubes to the
background flow is extremely strong.

Low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), which exist in a large
fraction of galaxies, may be the least luminous manifestation of quasar
activity. The nature of LINERs has, however, remained controversial because an
AGN-like nonstellar continuum source has not been directly observed in them. We
report the detection of bright, unresolved (FWHM $\ltorder 0.1''$) point
sources of UV ($\sim 2300$ \AA) emission in the nuclei of nine nearby galaxies
from a complete sample of 110 nearby galaxies imaged with {\it HST}.
Ground-based optical spectroscopy reveals that five of the nuclei are LINERs,
three are starburst nuclei, and one is a Seyfert nucleus. The observed UV flux
in each of the five LINERs implies an ionizing flux that is sufficient to
account for the observed emission lines through photoionization. The detection
of a strong UV continuum in the LINERs argues against shock excitation as the
source of the observed emission lines, and supports the idea that
photoionization excites the lines in at least some objects of this class. Among
the Northern-hemisphere galaxies in the sample, 26 are LINERs, of which only
the above five LINERs have a detected nuclear UV source. There are no obvious
differences in the optical line intensity ratios between the UV-bright and
UV-dark LINERs. If all LINERs are photoionized, then the continuum source is
unobscured along our line of sight in $5/26\approx 20\%$ of LINERs.
Alternatively, spectrally-similar LINERs may be produced by various excitation
mechanisms, with photoionization responsible in only about 20\% of the cases.
The high angular resolution allows us to set upper limits, typically several
parsecs, on the physical size of the compact star-cluster or AGN-type continuum
source that is emitting the UV light in these objects.

Velocity bias offers a single parameter ($b_v$) description of the likely
segregation of mass and light in a galaxy cluster. The relation between the
projected mass profile and the light profile, normalized by the virial $M/L$,
is presented as a function of $b_v\equiv\sigma_\ell/\sigma_\rho$, the ratio of
the RMS velocity dispersions of the galaxies and the underlying dark matter.
The light distribution does not trace the mass at any radius within the
cluster. At the apparent harmonic radius the gravitational mass can exceed the
virial mass calculated from the light by about a factor of 2 (or more). The
data for the MS1224+20 cluster, covering nearly a decade in radius, are well
described by a velocity bias value of $b_v=0.85\pm0.05$, comparable to the
n-body estimate of $b_v=0.8\pm0.1$. This particular value will remain tentative
until more data are available.

Much current interest in cosmology has revolved around the peculiar velocity
field of galaxies. Many methods have been proposed to derive this, probably the
most prominent being POTENT (Dekel et al. 1990). However, this is prone to many
forms of systematic error or bias. Here, we examine some of the methods
currently used to minimise these biases, particularly Malmquist corrections,
and highlight some of their pitfalls. As an alternative we propose an iterative
scheme based on Monte Carlo simulations of POTENT that shows noticeable
improvement over the other methods considered.

We apply a likelihood analysis to the data of \markcite{Lauer \& Postman
1994} With $P(k)$ parametrized by $(\sigma_8, \Gamma)$, the likelihood function
peaks at $\sigma_8\simeq0.3$, $\Gamma\lesssim0.025$, indicating at face value
very strong large-scale power, though at a level incompatible with COBE\@.
There is, however, a ridge of likelihood such that more conventional power
spectra do not seem strongly disfavored. The likelihood calculated using as
data only the components of the bulk flow solution peaks at higher $\sigma_8$,
in agreement with other analyses, but is rather broad. The likelihood
incorporating both bulk flow and shear gives a different picture. The
components of the shear are all low, and this pulls the peak to lower
amplitudes as a compromise.
  The Lauer \& Postman velocity data alone are therefore {\em consistent}\/
with models with very strong large scale power which generates a large bulk
flow, but the small shear (which also probes fairly large scales) requires that
the power would have to be at {\em very}\/ large scales, which is strongly
disfavored by COBE\@. The velocity data also seem compatible with more
conventional $P(k)$ with $0.2\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim0.5$, and the likelihood is
peaked around $\sigma_8\sim1$, in which case the bulk flow is a moderate, but
not extreme, statistical fluctuation.
  Applying the same techniques to the data of \markcite{Riess, Press, \&
Kirshner 1995}, the results are quite different. The flow is not inconsistent
with the microwave dipole and we derive only an upper limit to the amplitude of
the power spectrum: $\sigma_8\lesssim1.5$ at roughly 99\%.

The recently reported microlensing events of the LMC have caused much
excitement, and have been interpreted as due to `dark objects' (MACHOs) in the
halo of our Galaxy. It is shown here that the stars within the LMC play a
dominant role as gravitational lenses and can indeed account for the observed
events. The MACHO event and one of the EROS events lie within the bar for which
the probability of microlensing is consistent with being caused by an object
within the LMC. If the stars within the LMC play a dominant role as lenses, the
events should be concentrated towards the center of the LMC. If MACHOs play a
dominant role as lenses then, for a given number of monitored stars, the events
should be uniformly distributed over the whole of the LMC. Thus the galactic
and the LMC lenses can be statistically distinguished in most cases. It is
further shown that, under certain conditions, the light curve of an event
caused by a star within the LMC would be different from the one caused by a
MACHO. This can also be a distinguishing signature, and seems to have been
observed in case of the MACHO event. The fit discrepancy near the peak which
the authors say ``is not yet understood" would be a natural consequence if the
event is caused by an object within the LMC, which further indicates that the
lensing is due to a low mass star within the LMC itself.

An analysis of ROSAT observations for the eclipsing magnetic cataclysmic
binary DP Leo provides constraints on the origin, size, temperature,
variability and structure of the soft X-ray emission region on the surface of
the white dwarf. These data, when combined with prior observations, show a
progression of approximately 2 degrees per year in the impact position of the
accretion stream onto the white dwarf. One explanation for the observed drift
in stream position is that a magnetic activity cycle on the secondary produces
orbital period oscillations. These oscillations result in an orbital period
which cycles above and below the rotational period of the nearly synchronous
white dwarf. The accretion stream and X-ray emission regions are modeled to fit
the observational data. A distance to the system is also calculated. [An
erroneous value for the cyclotron luminosity, included in an earlier paper
version of the preprint, is corrected here.]

We find that dim gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are softer than bright GRBs, as
indicated on average by data from the Burst and Transient Source Experiment
(BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. We show that this
correlation is statistically significant with respect to variations due to
random differences between GRBs. This effect is discernable using a variety of
methods and data sets, including public domain data. We analyze several types
of systematic errors and selection effects in the BATSE data and conclude that
the observed effect is not dominated by any of them. We therefore assert that
this dim/soft effect is a real property of GRBs. It is possible that this
correlation is a consequence of the time dilation detected by Norris et al.
(1994) and that this is additional evidence that burst sources are located at
cosmological distances.

The weak distortions of high-redshift galaxies caused by gravitational light
deflection near clusters of galaxies can be used to reconstruct the projected
(two-dimensional) surface mass density of intermediate redshift clusters. This
technique, pioneered by Tyson, Valdes & Wenk, and Kaiser & Squires, is
reconsidered in the present paper, where we generalize the inversion equation
found by Kaiser & Squires (KS) in several respect. Adopting a different
smoothing procedure for the discreetly sampled data (individual galaxy images),
we effectively reduce the shot noise in the KS procedure. In particular we show
that the best density reconstructions are obtained if the smoothing scale is
adopted to the `strength of the signal', which yields a better resolution near
the center of the cluster where the distortions are strongest. Furthermore, we
point out the importance of boundary effects and demonstrate their disastrous
impact on rectangular data fields (CCDs) with large side ratio. Most important,
however, is the generalization of the KS method to critical clusters, i.e., to
such clusters which are capable of producing multiple images and giant luminous
arcs. The corresponding modifications of the inversion procedure are severe; in
particular, the resulting inversion equation is much more difficult to solve.
As we pointed out in a previous paper (Schneider & Seitz), there exists a local
degeneracy if the cluster is critical. We have developed an iteration procedure
to solve the inversion equation, which we demonstrate to yield a very accurate

Bursts from soft gamma repeaters have been shown to be super-Eddington by a
factor of 1000 and have been persuasively associated with compact objects.
Here, a model of super-Eddington radiation transfer on the surface of a
strongly magnetic ($\geq 10^{13}$ gauss) neutron star is studied and related to
the observational constraints on soft gamma repeaters. In strong magnetic
fields, the cross-section to electron scattering is strongly suppressed in one
polarization state, so super-Eddington fluxes can be radiated while the plasma
remains in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model offers a somewhat natural
explanation for the observation of similarity between spectra from bursts of
varying intensity. The radiation produced in the model is found to be linearly
polarized to about 1 part in 1000 in a direction determined by the local
magnetic field, and the large intensity variations between bursts are
understood as a change in the radiating area on the source. Therefore, the
polarization may vary as a function of burst intensity, since the complex
structure of the magnetic field may be more apparent for larger radiating
areas. It is shown that for radiation transfer calculations in this limit of
super-strong magnetic fields it is sufficient to solve the radiation transfer
equations for the low opacity state rather than the coupled equations for both.
With this approximation, standard stellar atmosphere techniques are utilized to
calculate the model energy spectrum.

At large redshifts, a cluster or group may be too distant for the galaxies
within the cluster to be detected individually. However, the light from these
``undetected'' galaxies still modulates the surface brightness of the
background sky. Clusters can appear as 10"-1.5' sized fluctuations in the
surface brightness of the EBL. The fluctuations have central surface
brightnesses between roughly 26 and 28 mag/sqr-arcsec (in V) for clusters
between z=1 and z=2, and are brighter than the fluctuations produced by
background field galaxies. While such low surface brightnesses are difficult to
achieve with direct high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that they are
easily reached in short exposures through smoothing the sky in very flat CCD
images. For a reasonable extrapolation of the properties and space densities of
clusters and groups, we find that for a wide range of cosmological assumptions
there should be tens of clusters per square degree visible in the extragalactic
background. The detection rate can range between 0.1 and 100 clusters per
square degree, for extreme assumptions about the rate of cluster and galaxy
evolution. Drift scans provide sufficient accuracy of flat-fielding to make the
method discussed in this paper an efficient techinque for finding candidate
high redshift clusters.

We study the secular evolution and gravitational wave signature of a
newly-formed, rapidly rotating neutron star. The neutron star may arise from
core collapse in a massive star or from the accretion-induced collapse of a
white dwarf. After a brief dynamical phase, the nascent neutron star settles
into an axisymmetric, secularly unstable equilibrium state. Gravitational
radiation drives the star to a nonaxisymmetric, stationary equilibrium
configuration via the bar-mode instability. The emitted quasi-periodic
gravitational waves have a unique signature: the wave frequency sweeps downward
from a few hundred Hertz to zero, while the wave amplitude increases from zero
to a maximum and then decays back to zero. Such a wave signal could be detected
by broad-band gravitational wave interferometers currently being constructed.
  We also characterize two other types of gravitational wave signals that could
arise in principle from a rapidly rotating, secularly unstable neutron star: a
high-frequency ($f\go 1000$ Hz) wave which increases the pattern-speed of the
star, and a wave that actually increases the angular momentum of the star.

We employ an approximate treatment of dissipative hydrodynamics in three
dimensions to study the coalescence of binary neutron stars driven by the
emission of gravitational waves. The stars are modeled as compressible
ellipsoids obeying a polytropic equation of state; all internal fluid
velocities are assumed to be linear functions of the coordinates. The
hydrodynamic equations then reduce to a set of coupled ordinary differential
equations for the evolution of the principal axes of the ellipsoids, the
internal velocity parameters and the binary orbital parameters. Gravitational
radiation reaction and viscous dissipation are both incorporated. We set up
exact initial binary equilibrium configurations and follow the transition from
the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation to the rapid
dynamical evolution of the configurations just prior to contact. A
hydrodynamical instability resulting from tidal interactions significantly
accelerates the coalescence at small separation, leading to appreciable radial
infall velocity and tidal lag angles near contact. This behavior is reflected
in the gravitational waveforms and may be observable by gravitational wave
detectors under construction.

In the framework of focused transport theory, adiabatic deceleration arises
from adiabatic focusing in the solar wind frame and from differential solar
wind convection. An explicit formula is given for the deceleration of
individual particles as a function of the pitch angle. Deceleration and other
first-order effects of the solar wind, including convection, are incorporated
into a numerical code for simulating the transport of energetic particles along
the interplanetary magnetic field. We use this code to model the transport of
solar flare protons. We find that including deceleration can increase the decay
rate of the near-Earth intensity by 75\% more than would be expected based on
advection from higher momenta, due to an interplay with diffusive processes.
Improved response functions are derived for the impulsive injection of
particles near the Sun, and it is found that neglecting deceleration leads to
incorrect estimates of the scattering mean free path based on the intensity
decay alone, especially for lower-energy particles.

We present a detailed comparison of the predictions of perturbation theory
for the averaged J-point correlation functions, $\xibar_J$, with the results of
numerical simulations of gravitational clustering. We have carried out a
systematic analysis of this method using ensembles of simulations with
different numbers of particles, different box sizes and using different
particle arrangements and clustering amplitudes in the initial conditions. We
estimate $\xibar_J$, for $J=2-10$, from moments of counts-in-cells. We find
significant non-linear effects in the variance, $J=2$, even at scales as large
as $R \sim 30 \Mpc$. Perturbation theory gives remarkable agreement at large
scales, where $\xibar_2 \simlt 1$, with the measured hierarchical amplitudes
$S_J=\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$. We have followed the evolution of $\xibar_J$ in
time and find that for a change in the effective redshift of at least $\Delta z
\simeq 2$ the amplitudes $S_J$ remain unchanged, despite the fact that the
$\xibar_J$ have evolved by large factors, $\simeq 10^{J-1}$. We illustrate how
these results can be applied to interpret the clustering in galaxy surveys and
conclude that the observed hierarchical pattern in the APM is compatible with
gravitational evolution in unbiased, initially Gaussian, models.

The Yale stellar evolution code has been modified to include the combined
effects of diffusion and rotational mixing on $^1$H, $^4$He and the trace
elements $^3$He, $^6$Li, $^7$Li, and $^9$Be. The interaction between rotational
mixing and diffusion is studied by calculating a number of calibrated solar
models. The rotational mixing inhibits the diffusion in the outer parts of the
models, leading to a decrease in the envelope diffusion by 25 -- 50\%.
Conversely, diffusion leads to gradients in mean molecular weight which can
inhibit the rotational mixing. The degree to which gradients in mean molecular
weight inhibits the rotational mixing is somewhat uncertain. A comparison to
the observed solar oblateness suggests that gradients in the mean molecular
weight play a smaller role in inhibiting the rotational mixing previously
believed. This is reinforced by the fact that the model with the standard value
for the inhibiting effect of mean molecular weight on the rotational mixing
depletes no Li on the main sequence. This is in clear contrast to the
observations. A reduction in the inhibiting effect of mean molecular weight
gradients by a factor of ten leads to noticeable main sequence Li depletion.

Stellar models with masses ranging from 0.5 to $1.3~M_\odot$ were constructed
in order to compare to young cluster observations of Li and of rotation
velocities. The amount of Li depletion in cool stars is sensitive to the amount
of overshoot at the base of the surface convection zone, and the exact
metallicity of the models. Even when this uncertainty is taken into account,
the Li observations are a severe constraint for the models and rule out
standard models, and pure diffusion models. Stellar models which include
diffusion and rotational mixing in the radiative regions of stars are able to
simultaneously match the Li abundances observed in the Pleiades, UMaG, Hyades,
Praesepe, NGC 752 and M67. They also match the observed rotation periods in the
Hyades. However, these models are unable to simultaneously explain the presence
of the rapidly rotating late G and K stars in the Pleiades and the absence of
rapidly rotating late F and early G stars.

I obtain an upper limit for the optical depth to microlensing toward Baade's
Window of $3\times 10^{-6}$ by assuming that all of the mass of the Galaxy
interior to the Sun (and not in the bulge) is in a disk. The exponential scale
height of the disk is left as a completely arbitrary function of radius and is
varied to maximize the optical depth. I take account of the relatively small
corrections induced by the fact that the bulge is not axisymmetric. If initial
estimates by the OGLE collaboration of an observed optical depth $\tau\sim
3.3\times 10^{-6}$ are confirmed, then essentially all of the dark matter
interior to the Sun must be in a disk with a scale height of a few hundred
parsecs.

We propose a self-consistent model for globular cluster formation in, but not
limited to, our Galaxy, based on the merger model of Mathews and Schramm
(1993). Stars and star clusters form in bursts at the merging interfaces as
protogalactic clouds collide. We describe the formation of those star clusters
with a simple schematic ansatz which takes into account the thermal and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. It is shown that this model is consistent with
many observational properties such as the age and metallicity distributions of
globular clusters, the overall number of globular clusters, and the near
constancy of the number of globular clusters in different size host galaxies.
Most of the features of this merger model are insensitive to choices of
parameters. However, the model does not exhibit two distinct populations of
globular clusters, i.e. halo clusters and disk clusters. Possible explanations
for this are presented.

We examine galactic chemical evolution models which reproduce the present-day
and pre-solar values of deuterium starting with a primordial value which is
consistent with a baryon-to-photon ratio of $3 \times 10^{-10}$. We consider
various galactic chemical evolution models to determine the viability of
significant deuterium destruction and which provide a consistent age of the
galaxy at the time of the formation of the solar system and consequently its
present day age from nuclear chronometers. These models generally require some
amount of infall which we take with rates proportional to the gas mass as well
as exponentially decreasing rates and some initial disk enrichment which we
limit to the range of 0\% to 30\%. We present those models which give the
observed pre-solar value and present-day value of D/H and which lead to a
present-day gas fraction of $\sigma = .05\quad - \quad .2$. These models result
in a braod range for the age of galaxy between $9.8 - 21.6$ Gyrs.

We have measured the T90 and T50 durations of bright and dim gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) detected by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory's Burst and Transient
Source Experiment (BATSE). The T90 (T50) duration is defined as the interval
over which 5\% (25\%) to 95\% (75\%) of the burst counts accumulate. Out of 775
bursts observed by BATSE, 159 bursts were analyzed; bursts with durations
shorter than 1.5 s were excluded. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a
probability of 6 x $10^{-5}$ that the T50 durations of the dim and bright
samples are drawn from the same parent population. We find that the centroid
and extent of the duration distribution for the dim sample are scaled by
approximately a factor of two relative to those of the bright sample. The
measured time dilation factor is not sensitive to choice of energy band. These
results are quantitatively consistent with previous tests for time dilation in
a smaller sample of BATSE bursts. The dimmer bursts, if cosmological, would lie
at redshifts of order two.

We introduce a new complex formalism to describe arclet fields in clusters of
galaxies and derive the appropriate inversion techniques to find the related
mass distribution of the lensing cluster. Applying the complex formalism to the
statistics of lensed background sources shows that the mean of the axial ratios
of locally lensed isotropically distributed elliptical sources is {\em not}
influenced by the intrinsic ellipticity distribution, if the cluster is
subcritical in that region.

We predict the observable properties of the galaxy population in popular
hierarchical models of galaxy formation. We employ a detailed semianalytic
procedure which incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter halos,
the shock heating and radiative cooling of gas, self-regulated star formation,
the merging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution of
the stellar populations. We contrast the standard CDM cosmogony with variants
of the CDM model having either a low value of H_0, or a low value of Omega with
or without a cosmological constant. In addition, we compare galaxy formation in
these CDM universes with a CHDM model. We find that although the models have
some success in remedying the shortcomings of the standard CDM cosmogony, none
of these new models produce broad agreement with the whole range of
observations. Although the low-Omega and Omega+Lambda=1 CDM models reduce the
discrepancy between the predicted and observed Tully-Fisher relations (the main
weakness of galaxy formation in standard CDM), these models predict an inverted
colour-magnitude relation and do not produce an exponential cut-off at the
bright end of the galaxy luminosity function. All of our models predict recent
star formation and exhibit galaxy colours bluer than observed, but this problem
is far more severe in the CHDM model which produces colours about two
magnitudes too blue in B-K. Unlike in the variants of the CDM model in the CHDM
case this result is not dependent on our model of stellar feedback, but is
instead directly caused by the late epoch of structure formation in this model.

We study the formation of galaxies by using $N$-body/hydrodynamics
simulations to investigate how baryons collect at the centre of dark matter
halos. We treat the dark matter as a collisionless fluid and the baryons as an
ideal gas. We include the effects of gravity, pressure gradients,
hydrodynamical shocks, and radiative energy losses, but we neglect star
formation. Our initial conditions assume a flat universe dominated by cold dark
matter with a mean baryon abundance of 10\% by mass. Typical halos form through
the merging of a few smaller systems which had themselves formed in a similar
manner at higher redshift. The gas collects at the bottom of dark matter
potential wells as soon as these are properly resolved by our simulations.
There it settles into cold, tightly bound disks, and it remains cold during
subsequent evolution. As their halos coalesce, these disks merge on a timescale
that is consistent with dynamical friction estimates based on their {\it total}
(gas + surrounding dark matter) mass. Both the merger rates of the disks and
their mass spectrum are in remarkably good agreement with recent analytic
models that describe the evolution of {\it dark halos} in a hierarchical
universe. This very simple model of galaxy formation suffers from serious
shortcomings. It predicts that most baryons should be locked up in galaxies,
whereas in the real universe most baryons are thought to lie outside visible
galaxies. In addition, it predicts the specific angular momentum of a disk to
be only about 20\% that of its surrounding halo, corresponding to a radius
smaller than that of observed spiral galaxy disks.

We investigate the dynamical interaction of galactic warps with the
surrounding dark matter halo, using analytic perturbation theory. A precessing
warp induces a density wake in the collisionless dark matter, which acts back
on the original warp, transferring energy and angular momentum between the warp
and halo (dynamical friction). In most cases dynamical friction damps the warp,
but in unusual circumstances (such as a halo that rotates in the same direction
as the precession of the warp, or a warp in the equatorial plane of an
axisymmetric prolate halo) friction can excite a warp. The damping/excitation
time is usually short compared to the Hubble time for realistic systems. Thus
most warps cannot be primordial; they must be maintained by some ongoing
excitation mechanism.

We present simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in
the Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Clusters with a wide range of mass were
selected from previous N-body models, and were resimulated at higher resolution
using a combined N-body/Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics code. The effects of
radiative cooling on the gas are neglected. While many present-day clusters are
predicted to be undergoing mergers, the density profiles of those that are
approximately in equilibrium are all very similar, both for the gas and for the
dark matter. These profiles show no sign of a uniform density core and steepen
gradually from the centre outwards. The standard $\beta$-model is a reasonable
fit over most of the radius range observable in real clusters. However, the
value obtained for the slope parameter $\beta_f$ increases with the outermost
radius of the fit. Temperature profiles of different simulated clusters are
also similar. Typically the temperature is almost uniform in the regions which
emit most of the X-ray flux but drops at larger radii. The gas temperature and
dark matter velocity dispersion in equilibrium clusters give values of
$\beta_T\equiv \mu m_p\sigma_{DM}^2/kT$ which are consistent with unity
provided an X-ray emission-weighted temperature is used. Larger values of
$\beta_T$ are found in merging objects where there is a transient boost in the
velocity dispersion of the system. Thus $\beta_T >1$ may be an observational
indicator of merging in real clusters. The similar structure of clusters of
differing mass results in scaling relations between the X-ray and dynamical
properties of clusters identified at

We use the two-point correlation function of the extrema points (peaks and
valleys) in the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) 2-year sky maps
as a test for non-Gaussian temperature distribution in the cosmic microwave
background anisotropy. A maximum likelihood analysis compares the DMR data to
n=1 toy models whose random-phase spherical harmonic components $a_{\ell m}$
are drawn from either Gaussian, $\chi^2$, or log-normal parent populations. The
likelihood of the 53 GHz (A+B)/2 data is greatest for the exact Gaussian model.
All non-Gaussian models tested are ruled out at 90\% confidence, limited by
type II errors in the statistical inference. The extrema correlation function
is a stronger test for this class of non-Gaussian models than topological
statistics such as the genus.

The two-point angular correlation function of galaxies, \wte, has been
computed from a new survey of faint galaxies covering a 2 deg$^2$ area near the
North Galactic Pole. This survey, which is complete to limiting magnitudes
\jmag=24 and \fmag=23, samples angular scales as large as $1\degpoint5$. Faint
galaxies are found to be more weakly clustered (by a factor of at least two)
compared to galaxies observed locally. Clustering amplitudes are closer to
model predictions in the red than in the blue. The weak clustering of faint
galaxies cannot be explained by any plausible model of clustering evolution
with redshift. However, one possible explanation of the clustering properties
of intermediate redshift galaxies is that they resemble those of starburst
galaxies and H II region galaxies, which are observed locally to possess weak
clustering amplitudes. Our clustering amplitudes are also similar to those of
nearby late-type galaxies, which are observed to be more weakly clustered than
early-type galaxies A simple, self-consistent model is presented that predicts
the fraction of galaxies in the ``excess'' population at intermediate
redshifts, and correctly matches observed color distributions. The available
data on the clustering properties of faint galaxies are consistent with this
model if the ``excess'' population of faint blue galaxies is also the weakly
clustered population. Evidence is presented that the power-law slope of the
angular correlation function becomes shallower at fainter magnitudes. A similar
effect is seen locally both for dwarf galaxies and for galaxies with late
morphological type;

We present magnitudes and redshifts of galaxies in the cluster of galaxies
CL0017-20 and in the double cluster CL0500-24. Luminosity functions and
velocity distributions have been derived. CL0017-20 possesses a virial mass of
$2.9 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ and a \vmag band luminosity of $2.3 \pm 0.5
\times 10^{12}$ L$_\odot$ ($M/L_{\rm V} = 127$), much of it in a very compact
core of size 113 kpc. Our new velocities and photometry of CL0500-24 confirm
its double nature. Our group algorithm clearly detects two subconcentrations
with masses 1.9 and $2.2 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. Its total \vmag band
luminosity amounts to $2.7 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$ ($M/L_{\rm V}$
of 157). Since the crossing and collapse times in both clusters are smaller
than the age of the Universe, they appear bound and virialized. It is
surprising that although $M/L$ is small in these clusters, giant arcs have been
detected in both.

Faint star number counts in the photographic \jmag band and \bvcol colour
distributions are presented for a 1.08 deg$^2$ field near the North Galactic
Pole. Due to the excellent star/galaxy discrimination we count stars as faint
as \jmag = 23. We compare the number counts and colour distributions in 5
adjacent fields near SA57. The number counts and colour distributions are in
very good agreement with previous data. However, we find that the large
field-to-field scatter in the colour distributions, which we argue is real,
might prevent us setting strong limits on Galactic structure. A simple two
component standard model, Bahcall and Soneira (1984), fits the number counts
reasonably well at the bright \jmag $< 21$, but fails notably at the faint end,
even if a third component is added, as in Reid and Majewski (1993). The
standard models are in good agreement with both the number counts and colour
distribution at $20 < $\vmag$< 21$. Although the standard models bimodal shape
of the colour distribution compares well with the data at $21 < $\vmag$< 21.5$,
the number counts of stars are underestimated.

We investigate the kinematics of the intermediate population using the
photometric and astrometric sample surveys towards two opposite directions
(galactic centre and anticentre) at intermediate latitude. A multivariate
discriminant analysis (MDA) is used to distinguish the `Thick Disk' from other
populations with the help of the Besan\c con model of population synthesis. The
data constrain the asymmetric drift of the intermediate population, which is
found to be 40$\pm$10 km sec$^{-1}$ and does not depend on the galactic radius.

We have been doing a sample survey in UBV photometry and proper motions as
part of an investigation of galactic structure and evolution. The programme is
based on Schmidt plates (from OCA, Tautenburg, Palomar and ESO Schmidt
telescopes) digitized with the MAMA machine (CAI, Paris). The high astrometric
quality of the MAMA gives access to micronic accuracy (leading to $<$ 2 mas per
year) on proper motions with a 35 years time base. The high proper motion
accuracy for faint star probes in wide-areas give access to the properties of
star samples out of the solar neighborhood. We have analyzed components of the
UVW galactic space motions resulting from the accurate proper motion surveys.
The kinematical distribution of F and G--type stars have been probed to
distances up to 2.5 kpc above the galactic plane. We have derived the constrain
on the structural parameters of the thin and thick disk components of the
Galaxy.

Adopting the hypothesis that the nonthermal emission of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) is primarily due to the acceleration of protons, we construct a
simple model in which the interplay of acceleration and losses can be studied
together with the formation of the emitted spectrum. The acceleration process
is assumed to be of the first order Fermi type, and the proton distribution as
well as the injected electrons and photons in the central region of the AGN are
described by spatially averaged kinetic equations. The various relevant
processes which dominate the three species are incorporated into the equations.
The technique used to solve these is presented and several tests of the
numerical implementation are presented. We also present results of a sample
time-dependent AGN model in which photons appear suddenly as a result of a
feedback instability and the system evolves to a steady state, in which the
acceleration process is saturated self-consistently by the photons it produces.
This example combines an X-ray power law index of about -1.7, together with a
break at an energy between 50 and 500~keV.

Paramagnetic alignment of fractal suprathermally rotating grains is
discussed. It is shown that if the concentration of H$_{2}$formation sites is
low and resurfacing is active, fractal structure of grains enhances their
alignment. Studying the influence of grain surface physics and chemistry on the
alignment we found that there exist two critical values of grain sizes, and the
alignment of smaller grains is expected to decrease as compared to the
predictions of the Purcell's theory (1979). One of the critical sizes is due to
intensified poisoning of active sites, while the other is a result of a finite
value of the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility in the limit of high
angular velocities. On the contrary, if active sites completely cover grain
surface, suprathermal rotation, and therefore efficient alignment, is possible
only for a limited range of grain sizes.

The formalism by Press and Schechter (PS) is often used to infer number
densities of virialized objects of mass M (e.g. quasars, galaxies, clusters of
galaxies, etc.) from a count of initially overdense regions in a Gaussian
density perturbation field. We reanalyze the PS-formalism by explicitly
counting underdense regions which are embedded within overdense regions, so
called cloud-in-clouds. In contrast to the original PS-formalism, our revised
analysis automatically accounts for all the cosmic material. We find that mass
distribution functions for virialized objects are altered by the proper
solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem. These altered distribution functions
agree much better with distribution functions inferred form N-body simulations
than the original PS-distribution functions.

We investigate the transport of baryon number across phase boundaries in a
putative first order QCD-phase transition. Two independent phenomenological
models are employed to estimate the baryon penetrability at the phase boundary:
chromoelectric flux tube models; and an analogy to baryon-baryon coalescence in
nuclear physics. Our analysis indicates that baryon transport across phase
boundaries may be order of magnitude more efficient than other work has
suggested. We discuss the substantial uncertainties involved in estimating
baryon penetrability at phase boundaries.

We construct a sample of numerical models for clusters of galaxies and employ
these to investigate their capability of imaging background sources into long
arcs. Emphasis is laid on the statistics of these arcs. We study cross sections
for arc length and length-to-width ratio and optical depths for these arc
properties, we examine the distribution of arc widths and curvature radii among
long arcs, and we compare these results to predictions based on simplified
(radially symmetric) cluster models. We find that the capability of the
numerically modeled clusters to produce long arcs is larger by about two orders
of magnitude than that of spherically symmetric cluster models with the same
observable parameters (core radii and velocity dispersions), and that they are
similarly efficient as singular isothermal spheres with the same
velocity-dispersion distribution. The influence of source ellipticity is also
investigated; we find that the optical depth for arcs with a length-to-width
ratio $\ga10$ is significantly larger for elliptical than for circular sources.
Given these results, we conclude that spherically symmetric lens models for
galaxy clusters, adapted to the observable parameters of these clusters,
grossly underestimate the frequency of long arcs. We attribute this difference
between numerically constructed and simplified analytical lens models to the
abundance and the extent of intrinsic asymmetry and to substructure in galaxy
clusters.

We present new results from extremely deep, high-resolution images of the
field around the double quasar QSO 0957+561. A possible gravitational arc
system near the double quasar has recently been reported, which, if real, would
set strong constraints on determinations of the Hubble constant from the time
delay in the double quasar. We find that both the morphology and the colors of
the claimed arc systems suggest that they are chance alignments of three and
two different objects, and not gravitationally lensed arcs. Hence, the
constraints on $H_0$-determinations from the arcs are not valid. Also, a small
group of galaxies at $z=0.5$ near the line-of-sight which was required to have
a very large mass in the physically interesting arc models, is most likely
insignificant. From our deep images we are able to use weak lensing of faint
background galaxies in the field to map the gravitational potential in the main
cluster. This sets new constraints on determinations of $H_0$. We find that the
Hubble constant is constrained to be less than 70km/(s Mpc), if the time delay
between the two images of the QSO is equal to or larger than 1.1 years.

The geometry of the quadruple lens system Q2237+0305 is modeled with a simple
astigmatic lens: a power-law mass distribution: m \propto r^\beta with an
external shear \gamma. The image positions can be reproduced with an accuracy
better than 0.01 arcsec for any 0.0 < \beta < 1.85 and the corresponding value
of \gamma = 0.1385 - 0.0689 \beta. This is a factor of about 4 more precise
than what can be achieved by the best constant M/L lens models. The image
intensity ratios and the time delay ratios are almost constant along our one
parameter family of models, but the total magnification varies from 8 to >
1000, and the maximum time delay (between leading image B and trailing image C)
for H_0 of 75 km/sec/Mpc varies from more than 20 hours to about 1.5 hours,
while \beta increases from 0.0 to 1.85.

The sky subtraction performances of multi-fiber spectrographs are discussed,
analysing in detail the case of the OPTOPUS system at the 3.6 meter ESO
telescope at La Silla. A standard technique, based on flat-fields obtained with
a uniformly illuminated screen on the dome, provides poor results. A new method
has been developed, using the [OI] emission line at 5577 \AA\ as a calibrator
of the fiber transmittance, taking into account the diffuse light and the
influence of each fiber on the adjacent ones, and correcting for the effects of
the image distortions on the sky sampling. In this way the accuracy of the sky
subtraction improves from $2-8 \%$ to $1.3-1.6 \%$.

We use radial velocities of member stars and cluster surface brightness
profiles to non-parametrically determine the mass density profiles and
isotropic phase-space distribution functions $f(E)$ for the globular clusters
M15 (NGC7078), 47~Tuc (NGC104), NGC~362, and NGC~3201. Assuming isotropy and
using the velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles, the Jeans
equation uniquely determines the mass density profile. In the two
centrally-concentrated clusters, M15 and 47~Tuc, we find that the mass-to-light
ratios (M/L's) reach minima around 1\arcmin, and increase by more than a factor
of four towards the cluster centers. For the two less centrally concentrated
clusters, the M/L decreases monotonically all the way into the center. All four
clusters exhibit an increase in the M/L's in their outer parts. If the
variations in the M/L's are due to equipartition of energy between different
mass stars, then we attribute the central increases to massive remnants and the
outer increases to low-mass stars (m$<0.3$M$_\odot$). By applying the crude
approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derive the present-day
mass function for each cluster. In the central 2--3 parsecs, 0.7--1.5 M$_\odot$
objects provide the bulk of the cluster mass. The paper is in a uuencoded
compressed tar file (260kb).

The theory predicts that the effect of gravitational lensing by the matter
associated with clusters of galaxies can magnify background sources, leading to
an enhancement of source number density around foreground clusters of galaxies.
We conduct a search for the associations of distant radio-bright quasars with
Abell clusters using the 1-Jy and 2-Jy all-sky catalogs. Statistics turns to be
very poor on the basis of the 1-Jy sample, which shows no correlations between
the distant radio quasars with the foreground Abell clusters above $1\sigma$
level. However, an apparent association ($>1\sigma$) of the 2-Jy radio sources
with the foreground Abell clusters has been detected on scale of $\sim20$
arcminutes. We point out that this enhancement is unlikely to be produced by
the statistical gravitational lensing hypothesis utilizing the matter
associated with a population of isolated clusters unless (1)their velocity
dispersion is a few times larger than the presently adopted value and/or (2)the
intrinsic counts of the radio-bright sources with flux have a steeper slope
than the presently observed ones. This indicates that (1)the observed
associations, if real, can be the integrated result of all the matter along the
line of sight to the distant quasars, namely, the weak lensing effect of
clusters of galaxies that trace large-scale structures of the universe, and/or
(2)the number counts of the radio-bright sources have been seriously
contaminated by lensing.

There is controversy about the measurement of statistical associations
between bright quasars and faint, presumably foreground galaxies. We look at
the distribution of galaxies around an unbiased sample of 63 bright, moderate
redshift quasars using a new statistic based on the separation of the quasar
and its nearest neighbour galaxy. We find a significant excess of close
neighbours at separations less than about 10 arcsec which we attribute to the
magnification by gravitational lensing of quasars which would otherwise be too
faint to be included in our sample. About one quarter to one third of the
quasars are so affected although the allowed error in this fraction is large.

We study the development of gravitational instability in the strongly
non-linear regime. For this purpose we use a number of statistical indicators
such as filamentary statistics, spectrum of overdense/underdense regions and
the void probability function, each of which probes a particular aspect of
gravitational clustering. We use these statistical indicators to discriminate
between different approximations to gravitational instability which we test
against N-body simulations. The approximations which we test are, the truncated
Zel'dovich approximation (TZ), the adhesion model (AM), and the frozen flow
(FF) and linear potential (LP) approximations. Of these we find that FF and LP
break down relatively early, soon after the non-linear length scale exceeds
$R_*$ -- the mean distance between peaks of the gravitational potential. The
reason for this break down is easy to understand, particles in FF are
constrained to follow the streamlines of the initial velocity field. Shell
crossing is absent in this case and structure gradually freezes as particles
begin to collect near minima of the gravitational potential. In LP particles
follow the lines of force of the primordial potential, oscillating about its
minima at late times when the non-linear length scale $k_{\rm NL}^{-1}\simeq
R_*$. Unlike FF and LP the adhesion model (and to some extent TZ) continues to
give accurate results even at late times when $k_{\rm NL}^{-1} \ge R_*$. This
is because both AM and TZ use

We analyze the density profiles and virial radii for a sample of 90 nearby
clusters, using galaxies with available redshifts and positions. Each cluster
has at least 20 redshifts measured within an Abell radius, and all the results
come from galaxy sets of at least 20 members. Most of the density profiles of
our clusters are well fitted by hydrostatic-isothermal-like profiles. The
slopes we find for many cluster density profiles are consistent with the
hypothesis that the galaxies are in equilibrium with the binding cluster
potential. The virial radii correlate with the core radii at a very high
significance level. The observed relationship between the two size estimates is
in agreement with the theoretical one computed by using the median values of
the density profile parameters fitted on our clusters. After correcting for
incompleteness in our cluster sample, we provide the universal distributions
functions of core and virial radii (obtained within half an Abell radius).

We report the discovery of a new catacysmic variable system,
RXJ051541+0104.6. The optical spectrum has a blue continuum with superposed H~I
and He~I and II emission lines. The soft X-ray spectrum is well fit with a
50~eV black body. The X-ray and optical data are suggestive of an AM~Herculis
system. The X-ray light curve shows extreme variability on timescales of
seconds, and suggests an orbital period of order 8~hours, nearly twice that of
the longest catalogued AM~Her period. When bright, the X-ray light curve breaks
up into a series of discrete bursts, which may be due to accretion of dense
blobs of material of about 10$^{17}$~gm mass.

We develop a method for general non-linear cluster lens reconstruction using
the observable distortion of background galaxies. The distortion measures the
combination $\gamma/(1-\kappa)$ of shear $\gamma$ and surface density $\kappa$.
From this we obtain an expression for the gradient of $\log (1 - \kappa)$ in
terms of directly measurable quantities. This allows one to reconstruct $1 -
\kappa$ up to an arbitrary constant multiplier. Recent work has emphasised an
ambiguity in the relation between the distortion and $\gamma/(1-\kappa)$. Here
we show that the functional relation depends only on the parity of the images,
so if one has data extending to large radii, and if the critical lines can be
visually identified (as lines along which the distortion diverges), this
ambiguity is resolved. Moreover, we show that for a generic 2-dimensional lens
it is possible to locally determine the parity from the distortion. The
arbitrary multiplier, which may in fact take a different value in each region
bounded by the contour $\kappa = 1$, can be determined by requiring that the
mean surface excess vanish at large radii and that the gradient of $\kappa$
should be continuous across $\kappa = 1$. We show how these ideas might be
implemented to reconstruct the surface density, if necessary without use of the
data in regions where determination of the parity is insecure, and we show how
one can measure the mass contained within an aperture, again, if necessary,
without using data within the aperture.

The presence of non-Gaussian features in the CMB radiation maps represents
one of the most long-awaited clues in the search for the actual structure of
the primordial radiation. These features could shed some light on the non
trivial task of distinguishing the real source of the primeval perturbations
leading to large scale structure. In the present paper we briefly review recent
work towards finding analytical estimates of the three- and four-point
correlation functions and of their zero-lag limits, namely, the skewness and
kurtosis, respectively. - Contributed talk to appear in the proceedings of
"Birth of the Universe & Fundamental Physics", May 18-21, 1994, Rome, Italy.

We show that the baryonic gas content of the halo of our galaxy can be probed
by performing a multipole expansion on the distribution of diffuse background
gamma-ray emission. While the monopole moment (isotropic background) can be
used to constrain the baryonic fraction of the halo gas, the quadrupole to
monopole ratio is a sensitive probe of the distribution of gas in the halo,
{\it i.e.} the degree of flattening of the gas distribution. The predicted
diffuse gamma ray flux is found to be very sensitive to the adopted cosmic ray
density distribution throughout the halo. If the cosmic rays are uniform, then
the upper bound on the gas fraction is $16.6\%$ regardless of the flattening of
the halo gas distribution. However, this bound can be weakened by taking into
account the removal of flux in and close to the galactic plane, especially for
a oblate ($e <1$) gas distribution. On the other hand, in the more realistic
situation that the cosmic rays linearly trace the smoothed halo mass (and halo
gas) distribution, then a stringent bound on the baryonic gas fraction in the
halo $\eta$, $\eta \ltwid 3\%$, can be placed with existing data, regardless of
halo flattening.

Non-Gaussian imprints on the cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) sky
are within the grasp of current experiments. A clear non-Gaussian signature
would be point-like sources. We have examined the nature of possible point
sources that were tentatively identified in a recent high frequency CBR
experiment with half-degree resolution (Cheng et al. 1994: MSAM).
  The effects of local foreground sources, including cold dust clouds, radio
sources and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to foreground rich clusters are
considered, and the effective spectral slopes of these various foreground
contaminations are calculated. Radio source emission and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect are ruled out as the explanation of the possible MSAM sources.
  Modeles are examined of extremely cold dust clouds which are located in the
solar neighborhood, the interstellar medium, the galactic halo or at
cosmological distances. We estimate the cloud mass and dust grain parameters,
and in particular the grain size distribution, that are required in order to
produce a detectable signal in an MSAM-type experiment. It is shown that cold
dust clouds can have an important effect on CBR experiments only if the clouds
are nearby, and located within a disc scale height of the solar neighborhood.
Cold dust emission remains a possible source of far-infrared signal at the
level of the detected CBR fluctuations on degree scales, but may be ruled out
if the dust emissivity index satisfies $\alpha = 1.5 \pm 0.5$ .

In a recent paper by Rodrigues-Williams \& Hogan (RH94), a correlation
between high-redshift, optically-selected QSOs and Zwicky clusters was reported
at a very high significance level. Due to the fairly bright flux threshold of
the cluster sample, these correlations cannot be interpreted as being due to an
environmental effect of the clusters on the quasar activity. The most likely
interpretation employed in RH94 was the effect of gravitational lensing by the
foreground clusters, though the required magnification to explain the observed
correlations has to be considerably higher than obtained from simple mass
models for the clusters. We have repeated the analysis of RH94 using a
different QSO sample, namely radio quasars and radio galaxies from the 1-Jy
sample. In accordance with RH, we detect a statistically significant
correlation between Zwicky clusters and 1-Jy sources with intermediate redshift
($z\approx 1$), but fail to detect significant effects for higher-redshift
sources. In addition, we detect a highly significant underdensity of
low-redshift radio sources around Zwicky clusters, for which an environmental
interpretation seems to be most reasonable. Our result for the overdensity of
$z\sim 1$ sources is in good agreement with previous results and can possibly
be interpreted as a lensing effect, though we have not tried to quantitatively
investigate a lensing model. Other interpretations, such as patchy dust
obscuration, can not explain the observed effect and its tendency with
redshift.

The frequency-independent RMS temperature fluctuations determined from the
COBE-DMR two year sky maps are used to infer the parameter Q_{rms-PS}, which
characterizes the normalization of power law models of primordial cosmological
temperature anisotropy. In particular, a 'cross'-RMS statistic is used to
determine Q_{rms-PS} for a forced fit to a scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich
(n = 1) spectral model. Using a joint analysis of the 7 degree and 10 degree
RMS temperature derived from both the 53 and 90 GHz sky maps, we find
Q_{rms-PS} = 17.0^{+2.5}_{-2.1} uK when the low quadrupole is included, and
Q_{rms-PS} = 19.4^{+2.3}_{-2.1} uK excluding the quadrupole. These results are
consistent with the n = 1 fits from more sensitive methods (e.g. power
spectrum, correlation function). The effect of the low quadrupole derived from
the COBE-DMR data on the inferred Q_{rms-PS} normalization is investigated. A
bias to lower Q_{rms-PS} is found when the quadrupole is included. The higher
normalization for a forced n = 1 fit is then favored by the cross-RMS
technique. As initially pointed out in Wright et al. (1994a) and further
discussed here, analytic formulae for the RMS sky temperature fluctuations will
NOT provide the correct normalization amplitude.

We present new data on the globular cluster system of the elliptical galaxy
NGC 3923 which show that it has the most globular clusters per unit luminosity
of any non-cluster elliptical yet observed, with $S_N=6.4 \pm1.4$. NGC 3923 is
also among the brightest ellipticals outside of a galaxy cluster for which the
number of globular clusters has been determined. Our observation of a large
number of clusters per unit luminosity (high $S_N$ value) for a bright
elliptical in a sparse environment is consistent with the suggestion of
Djorgovski \& Santiago that the number of globular clusters is a power law
function of the luminosity with an exponent greater than one. We relate this
higher specific frequency of globular clusters in more luminous galaxies to
other observations which indicate that the physical conditions within
elliptical galaxies at the time of their formation were dependent on galaxy
mass.

Summary of abstract: The existence of a new population of yet unrecognized
x-ray sources has been often suggested to resolve some pecularities in the
properties of the x-ray background (XRB), and has recently been indicated by an
analysis of resolved sources in deep ROSAT observations (Hasinger \etal 1993).
  We investigate the possibility that the indicated new population of x-ray
sources is Galactic in origin, and derive its properties which would resolve
the discrepancy found in the number counts of faint sources, and be consistent
with observational constraints on the total background intensity, the XRB
anisotropy, the number of unidentified bright sources, the Galaxy's total x-ray
luminosity, and with the results of fluctuation analyses of the unresolved XRB.
  We find that a flattened Galactic halo (or a thick disk) distribution with a
scale height of a few Kpc satisfies all the above requirements. The typical
x-ray luminosity of the sources is $\approx 10^{30-31}$ erg/s in the 0.5-2 KeV
band, the number density of sources in the Solar vicinity is $\sim 10^{-4.5}
pc^{-3}$, their total number in the Galaxy is $\sim 10^{8.5}$, and they
contribute $\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s to the Galaxy's total x-ray luminosity.
  We discuss the possible nature of these sources (subdwarfs, LMXBs, old
neutron stars), and argue that the inferred x-ray and optical luminosities of
the sources, their $\sim 2-4$ KeV spectrum, and the derived local number
density and spatial distribution are all consistent with them being intrinsicly
faint cataclysmic variables with low accretion rates. We discuss the possible
origin of such population, including an origin from disrupted globular clusters
or dark clusters, make predictions, and suggest observational tests.

Statistical uncertainties in determining the temperatures of hot (0.5 keV to
10 keV) coronal plasmas are investigated. The statistical precision of various
spectral temperature diagnostics is established by analyzing synthetic ASCA
Solid-state Imaging Spectrometer (SIS) CCD spectra. The diagnostics considered
are the ratio of hydrogen-like to helium-like line complexes of $Z\ge14$
elements, line-free portions of the continuum, and the entire spectrum. While
fits to the entire spectrum yield the highest statistical precision, it is
argued that fits to the line-free continuum are less susceptible to atomic data
uncertainties but lead to a modest increase in statistical uncertainty over
full spectral fits. Temperatures deduced from line ratios can have similar
accuracy but only over a narrow range of temperatures. Convenient estimates of
statistical accuracies for the various temperature diagnostics are provided
which may be used in planning ASCA SIS observations.

To test the primordial power spectra predicted by a double inflationary model
with a break of amplitude $\Delta=3$ at a scale of $2\pi/k\approx 10 \hm$ and
CDM as dominant matter content, we perform PM simulations with 128$^3$
particles on a 256$^3$ grid. The broken scale invariance of the power spectra
explains the extra power observed in the large-scale matter distribution.
COBE-normalized spectra and a linear biasing with $b\approx 2$ are shown to
reproduce the reconstructed power spectra from the CfA catalog. Identifying
galactic halos with overdensity of approximately two times the cell variance,
we can fit the angular correlation function using both the Limber equation and
creating a APM-like angular projection with the observed luminosity function.
Finally, the higher order moments of the galaxy distribution are shown to fit
reasonably well the observed values.

The transverse velocity of a spiral galaxy can be measured to an accuracy
$\sim 60\,\kms$ by making parallax observations of quasars being microlensed by
stars in the disk of the galaxy. To make the measurement, a quasar must be
located behind the disk of the galaxy between about 1 and 2 scale lengths from
the center. The quasar must then be monitored for microlensing events and the
events followed simultaneously from the Earth and a satellite in solar orbit,
preferably at $\sim 30\,$AU. A systematic search in a volume within
$21,000\,\kms$ could locate quasars with $B<23$ behind a total of $\sim 1900$
galaxies. The rate of lensing events (and hence galaxy velocity measurements)
would be $\sim 3\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The events would have typical characteristic
times $\omega^{-1}\sim 3\,$yr. Under the assumption that the mass spectrum of
lensing objects is the same in other spiral galaxies as in our own, the
observations could be used to measure the Hubble parameter to an accuracy of
5\%.

Microlensing maps -- that is, contours of equal numbers of events per $10^6$
source stars -- are provided for the inner Galaxy under two alternative
hypotheses : (1) the bulge is an oblate axisymmetric spheroid or (2) the bulge
is a prolate bar. Oblate spheroids yield a total of $\sim 12$ events per year
per $10^6$ stars at Baade's Window ($\sim 15$ events if the disk is maximal).
The event rate is slightly lower for prolate bars viewed at $\sim 45^\circ$ and
the maps have a characteristic asymmetry between positive and negative
longitudes. Prolate bars can yield mild amplifications of the event rate if
viewed almost down the long axis. The disk provides the dominant lensing
population on the bulge major axis for $|\ell | \gta 6^\circ$. Measurements of
the rate at major axis windows can test for disk dark matter or maximal disk
models.

The COBE detection of CMB anisotropies provides the best way of fixing the
amplitude of fluctuations on the largest scales. This normalization is usually
given for an n=1 spectrum, including only the anisotropy caused by the Sachs-
Wolfe effect. This is certainly not a good approximation for a model containing
any reasonable amount of baryonic matter. In fact, even tilted S-W spectra are
not a good fit to models like CDM. Here we normalize standard CDM (sCDM) to the
2-year COBE data, and quote the best amplitude in terms of the conventionally
used measures of power. We also give normalizations for some specific variants
of this standard model, and we indicate how the normalization depends on the
assumed values of n, Omega_B and H_0. For sCDM we find <Q>=19.9\pm1.5uK,
corresponding to sigma_8=1.34\pm0.10, with the normalization at large scales
being B=(8.16\pm1.04)\times10^5 (Mpc/h)^4, and other numbers given in the
Table. The measured rms temperature fluctuation smoothed on 10deg is a little
low relative to this normalization. This is mainly due to the low quadrupole in
the data: when the quadrupole is removed, the measured value of sigma(10) is
quite consistent with the best-fitting <Q>. The use of <Q> should be preferred
over sigma(10), when its value can be determined for a particular theory, since
it makes full use of the data.

We describe a calculation of electromagnetic cascading in radiation and
matter in the early universe initiated by the decay of massive particles or by
some other process. We have used a combination of Monte Carlo and numerical
techniques which enables us to use exact cross sections, where known, for all
the relevant processes. In cascades initiated after the epoch of big bang
nucleosynthesis $\gamma$-rays in the cascades will photodisintegrate $^4$He,
producing $^3$He and deuterium. Using the observed $^3$He and deuterium
abundances we are able to place constraints on the cascade energy deposition as
a function of cosmic time. In the case of the decay of massive primordial
particles, we place limits on the density of massive primordial particles as a
function of their mean decay time, and on the expected intensity of decay
neutrinos.

We derive the 1-point probability density function of the smoothed 3-D
Abell-ACO cluster density field and we compare it with that of artificial
cluster samples, generated as high peaks of a Gaussian field in such a way that
they reproduce the low-order (2- and 3-point) correlation functions and the
observed cluster selection functions. We find that both real and simulated {\em
pdf}'s are well approximated by a log-normal distribution even when the
Gaussian smoothing radius is as large as 40 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Furthermore the
low-order moments of the {\em pdf} are found to obey a relation $\gamma = S_{3}
\sigma^4$, with $\gamma$ being the skewness and $S_{3}\approx 1.8$. These
results are consistent with clusters being high-peaks of an underlying initial
Gaussian density field. A by-product of our analysis is that when we rescale
the {\em pdf} cluster moments to those of the QDOT-IRAS galaxies, using linear
biasing with $b_{cI}\sim 4.5$ and for the common smoothing radius of 20
$h^{-1}$ Mpc, we find them to be significantly smaller than those directly
estimated from the QDOT data by Saunders et al. (1991).

A total of 663 galaxies with known redshifts in a $6\deg\!\times 6\deg$ field
centered on A2634, including 211 new measurements, are used to study the
structure of this cluster and its surroundings. Two samples, ---one containing
200 galaxies within two degrees from the cluster center and a second,
magnitude-limited, of 118 galaxies within the central half degree---, are used
to examine the structure, kinematics, dynamics of A2634. We show that
early-type galaxies appear to be a relaxed system, while the spiral population
eschews the center of the cluster and exhibits both a multimodal velocity
distribution and a much larger velocity dispersion than the ellipticals. We
find no evidence of significant substructure in the central regions supportive
of a recent merger of two subclusters, a scenario that has been suggested to
explain the bending of the tails of the cluster central radio source (3C 465).
We also conclude that the adoption of lenient membership criteria that ignore
the dynamical complexity of A2634 are unlikely to be responsible for the
conflictual results reported on the motion of this cluster with respect to the
CMB. The kinematical and dynamical analysis is extended to A2634's close
companion, A2666, and to two distant background clusters at 18,000 and 37,000
$\rm km s^{-1}$.

We have obtained spectroscopy of Q 1343+266 AB, a pair of quasars at redshift
z = 2.03 with a projected separation of 9.5 arcseconds. This system is
well-suited for probing the Ly-alpha forest, since the two component spectra
show several Ly-alpha lines in common and several others not. Using Bayesian
statistics, under the idealization of uniform-radius spherical absorbers, we
find that the Ly-alpha cloud radius at $z \approx 1.8$ lies in the range
$40\hkpc < R < 280 \hkpc$ with $98\%$ confidence in a $(\Omega_o, \Lambda_o) =
(1, 0)$ model universe, where $h =(H_o / 100 km s^{-1}
  Mpc^{-1})$. The median value of R is 90 h^-1 kpc. \ These numbers scale up by
a factor 1.44 for $(\Omega_o, \Lambda_o) =(0.1, 0)$; and by a factor 1.85 for
(0.1, 0.9). Pressure-confined and freely-expanding Ly-alpha cloud models in
which the absorbers formed in a significantly more compressed state at $z \gg
2$ are contradicted by these new data, as are models involving stably-confined
gas concentrations in photoionization equilibrium within minihalos of cold dark
matter. The comoving density of Ly-alpha forest objects at $z\sim 2$ is $\sim
0.3 h (R/100 kpc)^{-2} Mpc^{-3}$ in a (1,0) model universe. This suggests a
possible identification of Ly-alpha clouds with the unvirialized, collapsing
progenitors of the faint, blue galaxies at $z\sim 1$.

We present spectra of QSOs 1343+266 A B, covering Ly-beta to C~IV emission at
2\AA~resolution, and find further evidence that this system is not
gravitationally lensed. We see, however, a large number of Ly-alpha and some
C~IV absorption features common to both spectra. The frequency of C~IV lines in
common indicates that these absorbers have a radius close to the sightline
separation, $39~h^{-1}$kpc ($q_o=0.5$), implying a spatial number density of
these absorbers the same as current day $L>0.3L_*$ galaxies. Furthermore, the
velocity mismatch for C~IV systems indicates absorber masses in the range
$10^{11}~M_{\odot} < M < 10^{12}~M_{\odot}$. These results confirm that typical
galaxies cause QSO C~IV-line absorption. A complete line-list of metal-lines
and the Ly-alpha forest is presented

The {\em Van Cittert Zernike} theorem consists of a simple relation between
the measured coherence of the radiation and the characteristics of the emitting
stochastic source. In the present work, an extension of the theorem to
partially correlated sources in curved spacetime is derived. The generalized
theorem is used to evaluate the changes in the spectrum of light travelling
through a gravitational lens. Some possible astrophysical applications are
discussed, accompanied by a numerical estimation of the spectrum modification
in the process of propagation through a gravitational lens.

In this paper we discuss limits on magnetic fields that could have been
present at nucleosynthesis time. We considered several effects that could be
relevant modifing light elements relic abundances. They include: changes in
reaction rates, mass shifts due to strong and electromagnetic interactions,
variation of the expansion rate of the Universe due to both the magnetic field
energy density and the increasing of the electrons density in overcritical
magnetic fields.
  We find that the latter is the main effect. It was not taken into account in
previous calculations. The allowed field intensity at the end of
nucleosynthesis ($T =1\times 10^9\;^o{\rm K}$) is $B \le 3\times 10^{10}$
Gauss.

We have reanalyzed a data set of 99 low redshift ($ z < 0.1 $) Abell clusters
and determined their shapes. For this, three different measures are used. We
use Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the errors in the methods. The
corrected distribution of cluster ellipticities shows a peak at $ \epsilon \sim
0.4 $ and extends to $ \epsilon \sim 0.8 $. The results are self-consistent,
i.e., with the corrected distribution over projected cluster shapes we can
reconstruct the observed distribution and the observed relation between the
number of galaxies in a cluster and its ellipticity. It is shown that the
richer clusters are intrinsically more nearly spherical than the poorer ones.
The corrected distribution of cluster shapes is more consistent with a prolate
population than with an oblate population.
  We compare the corrected true distribution of (projected) ellipticities with
predictions from N-body simulations. For this, we use a catalogue of 75 N-body
simulated clusters (van Kampen 1994) which assume a CDM spectrum with $ \Omega
= 1.0 $. The simulations include a recipe for galaxy formation and merging.
'Observing' these simulated clusters produces an ellipticity distribution that
extends to much higher $ \epsilon $ and that has too few nearly spherical
clusters. Preliminary results of simulations of the formation of clusters in an
$ \Omega = 0.2 $ universe suggest that, on average, clusters are more nearly
spherical in this case.

An investigation into the acceleration of protons by scattering off
relativistic Alfv\'{e}n waves in the accretion column of Hercules X-1 is
presented. The mechanism is shown to achieve mean particle energies of 30~TeV
under very reasonable assumptions about the environment, and 250~TeV is
available under some circumstances. The highest individual energy attained is
almost 1~PeV. The protons emerge in the form of a narrow beam directed at the
inner edge of the accretion disk, which is favourable because of the reduced
power requirement and presence of target material for gamma-ray production.

Our proposed method to study the star formation histories in nearby
irregulars is here applied to NGC 6822. To this purpose we have obtained
accurate CCD photometry of three regions in the galaxy, reaching V$\simeq$23.5
with an accuracy of $\sigma_{BVR}\leq$0.1 mag. The comparison of the
observational color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions with
corresponding synthetic simulations reveals that the star formation activity in
the last Gyr has been rather continuous, possibly occurring in long episodes
separated by short quiescent periods, and that the initial mass function
exponent $\alpha$ is in the vicinity of Salpeter's value. The studied regions
of NGC~6822 appear to contain different stellar populations. The preferred star
formation regime for Region A is a continuous activity coupled with a
moderately flat $\alpha$. For Region C, instead, our best models suggest a
discontinuous star formation and a moderately steep $\alpha$. NGC 6822 is the
last object of our original sample of five nearby irregulars. We can then draw
the scenario resulting from this sample: most of the observed fields appear to
have experienced a {\it gasping} regime of star formation, with average
exponent $\alpha$=2.35 for the initial mass function. Despite their small
sizes, the majority of the sample galaxies contain different stellar
populations in different regions.

We present a method for simulating numerically the effect of the adiabatic
growth of black holes on the structure of elliptical galaxies. Using a parallel
self--consistent field code, we add black holes to N--body realizations of
model distribution functions for spherical galaxies, using a continuous
mass--spectrum. The variable particle mass, combined with a simple multiple
timestep integration scheme, makes it possible to evolve the models for many
dynamical times with $N \sim 10^6-10^8$, allowing high spatial and mass
resolution. This paper discusses verification of the code using analytic models
for spherical galaxies, comparing our numerical results of the effect of
central black holes on the structure of the galaxies with previously published
models. The intrinsic and projected properties of the final particle
distribution, including higher order moments of the velocity distribution,
permit comparison with observed characteristics of real galaxies, and constrain
the masses of any central black holes present in those galaxies. Our technique
is promising and is easily extended to axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies.

Using simulated redshift surveys generated from a high resolution N-body
cosmological structure simulation, we study algorithms used to identify groups
of galaxies in redshift space. Two algorithms are investigated; both are
friends-of-friends schemes with variable linking lengths in the radial and
transverse dimensions. The chief difference between the algorithms is in the
redshift linking length. The algorithm proposed by Huchra \& Geller (1982) uses
a generous linking length designed to find ``fingers of god'' while that of
Nolthenius \& White (1987) uses a smaller linking length to minimize
contamination by projection.
  We find that neither of the algorithms studied is intrinsically superior to
the other; rather, the ideal algorithm as well as the ideal algorithm
parameters depend on the purpose for which groups are to be studied. The
Huchra/Geller algorithm misses few real groups, at the cost of including some
spurious groups and members, while the Nolthenius/White algorithm misses high
velocity dispersion groups and members but is less likely to include
interlopers in its group assignments.
  In a companion paper we investigate the accuracy of virial mass estimates and
clustering properties of groups identified using these algorithms.

Two algorithms for the identification of galaxy groups from redshift surveys
are tested by application to simulated data derived from N-body simulation. The
accuracy of the membership assignments by these algorithms is studied in a
companion to this paper (Frederic 1994). Here we evaluate the accuracy of group
mass estimates and the group-group correlation function.
  We find a strong bias to low values in the virial mass estimates of groups
identified using the algorithm of Nolthenius \& White (1987). The Huchra \&
Geller (1982) algorithm gives virial mass estimates which are correct on
average. These two algorithms result in group catalogs with similar two-point
correlations.
  We find that groups in a CDM model have excessively large mass to light
ratios even when the group richness distribution agrees with observations. We
also find that our CDM groups are more strongly correlated than individual
halos (galaxies), unlike the groups in the CfA redshift survey extension.

If gravitational clustering is a hierarchical process, the present
large-scale structure of the galaxy distribution implies that structures on
smaller scales must have formed at high redshift. We simulate the formation of
small-scale structure (average cell mass: $\Delta \bar m_b=10^{4.2}$M$_\odot$)
and the evolution of photoionized gas, in the specific case of a CDM model with
a cosmological constant. The photoionized gas has a natural minimal scale of
collapse, the Jeans scale ($m_{b,J}\simeq 10^{9}$M$_\odot$). We find that low
column density ($\nhi \le 10^{14}\cm^{-2}$) lines originate in regions
resembling Zel'dovich pancakes, where gas with overdensities in the range $3 -
30$ is enclosed by two shocks but is typically re-expanding at approximately
the Hubble velocity. However, higher column density ($\nhi \ge
10^{15}\cm^{-2}$) lines stem from more overdense regions where the shocked gas
is cooling. We show that this model can probably account for the observed
number of lines, their distribution in column density and b-parameters, as well
as the cloud physical sizes as observed in gravitationally lensed quasars. We
find a redshift evolution that is

We show that most of hot, optically thin accretion disk models which ignore
advective cooling are not self-consistent. We have found new types of optically
thin disk solutions where cooling is dominated by radial advection of heat.
These new solutions are thermally and viscously stable.

The global nonlinear time-dependent evolution of the inertial-acoustic mode
instability in accretion disks surrounding black holes has been investigated.
The viscous stress is assumed to be proportional to the gas pressure only,
i.e.\,, $\tau = - \alpha p_g$. It is found that an oscillatory instability
exists in the inner regions of disks ($r < 10 r_g$, where $r_g$ is the
Schwarzschild radius) for sufficiently large $\alpha$ ($\gapprox 0.2$), and for
mass accretion rates less than about 0.3 times the Eddington value. The
variations of the integrated bolometric luminosity from the disk, $\Delta L/L$,
are less than 3\%. A power spectrum analysis of these variations reveals a
power spectrum which can be fit to a power law function of the frequency $P
\propto f^{-\gamma}$, with index $\gamma \sim 1.4-2.3$ and a low frequency
feature at about 4 Hz in one case. In addition, a narrow peak centered at a
frequency corresponding to the maximum epicyclic frequency of the disk at $\sim
100-130$ Hz and its first harmonic is also seen. The low frequency modulations
are remarkably similar to those observed in black hole candidate systems. The
possible existence of a scattering corona in the inner region of the disk
and/or to other processes contributing to the power at high frequencies in the
inner region of the accretion disk may make the detection of the high frequency
component difficult.

We have searched for mm-wave emission from compact objects in two fields,
each approximately 1 square degree in size, taken from regions of the sky in
which degree-scale structure in the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) has
recently been reported. The observations were made at frequency of 4.7~cm^-1
and with an angular resolution of 1.7' using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Infrared
Experiment (SuZIE) bolometer array at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
(CSO). The first field was centered on 14.92hr +82deg (1994.0), one of two
regions in which Cheng et al. (1994) identify the signature of an unresolved
point source seen during 0.5 degree resolution observations made at 5.6~cm^-1
with the Medium Scale Anisotropy Measurement (MSAM) experiment. The second
field was centered on 15.47hr +72.4deg (1994.0), part of the Gamma Ursae
Minoris (GUM) region where several prominent features have been detected by
Devlin et al. (1994) in 0.55 degree-resolution observations made at 3.5 and
6~cm^-1 with the Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment (MAX). We find that there is
no point source in either field that can account for the structure observed at
0.5 degree resolution, and that the structure must arise from objects with an
angular size greater than 2'.

We have developed a gravity solver based on combining the well developed
Particle-Mesh (PM) method and TREE methods. It is designed for and has been
implemented on parallel computer architectures. The new code can deal with tens
of millions of particles on current computers, with the calculation done on a
parallel supercomputer or a group of workstations. Typically, the spatial
resolution is enhanced by more than a factor of 20 over the pure PM code with
mass resolution retained at nearly the PM level. This code runs much faster
than a pure TREE code with the same number of particles and maintains almost
the same resolution in high density regions. Multiple time step integration has
also been implemented with the code, with second order time accuracy. The
performance of the code has been checked in several kinds of parallel computer
configuration, including IBM SP1, SGI Challenge and a group of workstations,
with the speedup of the parallel code on a 32 processor IBM SP2 supercomputer
nearly linear (efficiency $\approx 80\%$) in the number of processors. The
computation/communication ratio is also very high ($\sim 50$), which means the
code spends $95\%$ of its CPU time in computation.

We compute the predicted optical depth and duration distribution of
microlensing events towards Baade's window in a model composed of a Galactic
disk and a bar. The bar model is a self-consistent dynamical model built out of
individual orbits that has been populated to be consistent with the COBE maps
of the Galaxy and kinematic observations of the Bulge. We find most of the
lenses are at 6.25 kpc in BW. The microlensing optical depth of a 2E10 Msun bar
plus a truncated disk is (2.2+-0.3)E-6, consistent with the very large optical
depth (3.2+-1.2)E-6 found by Udalski et al. (1994). This prediction doubles
that of axisymmetric models by Kiraga and Paczynski (1994) since the bar is
elongated along the line-of-sight. The large Einstein radius and small
transverse velocity dispersion also predict a longer event duration in the bar
model than the KP model. The event rate and duration distribution also depend
on the lower mass cutoff of the lens mass function. With a 0.1Msun cutoff, 5-7
events of typical 20 days duration are expected for the OGLE experiment
according to our model, while Udalski et al. observed 9 events with durations
from 8-62 days. On the other hand, if most of the lenses are brown dwarfs, our
model predicts too many short duration events; a KS test finds only 7%
probability for the model with 0.01Msun cutoff to be consistent with current
data.

We present statistically robust observational evidence which imposes new
limits on dynamo saturation in young solar-type stars. These are inferred from
the increasing amplitude of the V-band optical flux with rotation, caused by
the filling of the disc with surface spots in a non-axisymmetric pattern.
Assuming spot coverage acts as a tracer of the total magnetic surface flux we
find that the magnetic activity saturates at a level at least 6 -- 10 times
greater than that inferred from chromospheric and transition line indicators.
We suggest that these new limits imply a minimum rotation for saturation of the
dynamo and that for high rotation rates starspot coverage acts as an
alternative diagnostic for the stellar dynamo to the chromospheric and
transition region line emission fluxes. The fact that the dynamo does not
appear to saturate at the low rotation rates indicated by chromospheric
indicators should assist evolutionary braking models that have to explain the
sudden spin-down of young fast rotating G-dwarfs. ( + 3 figures, available on

We study a sample of 62 Baade's Window (1,-4) K giants that have published
proper motions, radial velocity and metallicity. We construct the velocity
ellipsoids for the metal rich stars and metal poor stars. We find a vertex
deviation characteristic of a non-axisymmetric system. The long axes of the
velocity ellipsoids of two samples point to two nearly perpendicular directions
(lv,bv)=(-65+-9,+14+-9) and (25+-14,-11+-14) respectively. The vertex
deviations of the velocity ellipsoids cannot be consistently explained by ANY
oblate model. We populate orbits in a realistic bar potential with a Gaussian
velocity distribution, allowing us to simulate and interpret observations. We
conclude that the data are consistent with a triaxial bulge pointing towards
(l,b) with l<0 and b=0 as suggested by earlier work. We also predict that low
latitude abs(b)<4 deg bulge fields should show the vertex deviation more
strongly and would therefore be the best locations for future proper motion
studies. The metal rich and metal poor stars appear to occupy the direct boxy
and retrograde loop orbits. The correlations between the metallicity and the
orbit families can develop if the Bulge forms dissipatively on a sufficiently
long time scale. However, it is difficult to reconcile the existence of such
correlations with a violent history for the potential of the inner Galaxy.

We report on the results of a search for the radio counterpart to the bright
gamma-ray burst of March 1, 1994. Using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical
Observatory Synthesis Telescope sensitive, wide-field radio images at 1.4 GHz
and 0.4 GHz were made of a region around GRB940301. A total of 15 separate
radio images were obtained at each frequency, sampling a near-continuous range
of post-burst timescales between 3 and 15 days, as well as 26, 47 and 99 days.
We place an upper limit of 3.5 mJy on a fading/flaring radio counterpart at 1.4
GHz and 55 mJy at 0.4 GHz. Previous searches have concentrated on searching for
a counterpart at only one epoch following the outburst. In contrast, the
present search maintains high sensitivity over two decades of post-burst time
durations. Time-variable radio emission after the initial gamma-ray burst is a
prediction of all fireball models, currently the most popular model for
gamma-ray bursts. Our observations allow us to put significant constraints on
the fireball parameters for cosmological models of gamma-ray bursts.

Recently, Jakobsen et al. reported that the HeII Gunn-Peterson optical depth
is greater than 1.7 at $ z=3.3$. When we consider this observation combined
with the HI Gunn-Peterson optical depths and the intensity of the UV background
at high redshifts, we can put constraints on the spectrum of the UV background
and the mass fraction of intergalactic medium. We find that the spectrum must
be steep ($\alpha \gsim 3; J_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha} $) to be consistent
with observations, and that the mass fraction of the intergalactic medium must
be greater than 0.3 (0.1) in the case $ \alpha=3 (4)$ for baryon density
consistent with the primordial nucleosynthesis. We also find that HeII fraction
is as low as $10^{-3} \sim 10^{-1} $ even for this steep spectrum.

We re-examine the effects of redshift space distortion in all-sky galaxy
redshift surveys in the formalism of spherical harmonics. Within this framework
we show how one can treat both the large-scale linear effects, and the
small-scale nonlinear clustering, exactly to first order. The method also
allows in principle a determination of the power spectrum of perturbations,
requiring no assumptions beyond that of linear theory. The method therefore
offers significant advantages over Fourier techniques when dealing with all-sky
surveys. We apply our likelihood analysis to both simulated data, and real
data, using the IRAS 1.2-Jy galaxy catalogue, for which we find a maximum
likelihood $\beta \simeq 1.1\pm 0.3$, and a real-space fluctuation amplitude
corresponding to $\sigma_{8,{\rm IRAS}} = 0.68\pm 0.05$.

Strong upper limits are placed on the visual-band brightnesses of galactic
hosts for four luminous, radio-quiet quasars with redshifts between $0.16$
and~$0.24$ that were studied with the HST's Wide Field/Planetary Camera-2.
Typical upper limits on the luminosities of galactic hosts are about $1.4$ mag
fainter than $L^*$ for spirals and about $0.5$ mag fainter than $L^*$ for
ellipticals. The galactic hosts of the quasars are more than a magnitude and a
half fainter than the median integrated absolute magnitude of Seyfert galaxies.
If the detection limits are determined using featureless simulated galaxies
instead of observed galaxy images, then the detection limits for spirals are
0.5--1.0 mag less stringent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that the quasar phenomenon corresponds to the early stages of galaxy formation,
before extensive star formation occurs.

The recent proposal by Kellermann (1993) to use the angular size/redshift
relation of compact radio sources to obtain information on the value of
cosmological parameters has provoked considerable discussion in the
astronomical community. I present here a careful re-analysis of the angular
size/redshift data of radio jets used by Kellermann (1993), using a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check the independence of the distribution of linear
jet sizes from redshift under the assumption that no evolution is present in
the sources. The test takes into account biasing of the sample due to the
limited resolution. While the data are compatible with an Einstein-de~Sitter
Universe ($P=0.2$), they are not sufficient to rule out a significant part of
the $(\Omega_0,\lambda_0)$-plane.

We estimate the variance and the skewness of the cluster distribution in
several dark matter (DM) models. The cluster simulations are based on the
Zel'dovich approximation, the low computational cost of which allows us to run
50 random realizations of each model. We compare our results with those coming
from a similar analysis of a redshift sample of Abell/ACO clusters. Within the
list of the considered models, we find that only the model based on Cold+Hot DM
(with $\Omega_{\rm hot}=0.3$) provides a good fit to the data. The standard CDM
model and the low-density ($\Omega_{\circ}=0.2$) CDM models, both with and
without a cosmological constant term ($\Omega_\Lambda =0.8$) are ruled out. The
tilted CDM model with primordial spectral index $n=0.7$ and a low Hubble
constant ($h=0.3$) CDM model are only marginally consistent with the data.

We consider several factors concerning the design of observing strategies in
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy experiments. First we consider the
number of independent points on the sky one should observe given a fixed
observing time. Given an assumed level of sky temperature fluctuations,
$\sigma_{sky}$ and the presence of instrumental noise $s$ in units of K
s$^{-1/2}$ and a total observing time $t_{obs}$, we find there is an optimum
number of points in the sky to maximize the confidence level of a detection.
This number is a function of the signal to noise ratio $R^2 = \sigma_{sky}^2
t_{obs}/s^2$. We verify this analytical result with a monte carlo simulation,
which also includes the correlation between different positions in the sky.
Furthermore, using an $n=1$ spectrum of Gaussian fluctuations, we show that
arranging the observing patterns along a (great) circle, a raster scan, or a
randomized pattern yields results which are indistinguishable in Monte carlos.

We present near-infrared images of NGC 4314 in the $J$,$H$, and $K$ bands.
Colors in these bands are constant across the bar of NGC 4314 indicating that
the mass-to-light ratio is constant over much of the galaxy. We have developed
an efficient procedure for mapping the gravitational potential of a
non-axisymmetric galaxy based on its appearance in the near-infrared using a
Fourier Transform method. We account for the thickness of the galaxy's stellar
disk by convolving its $K$ image with a function that depends upon the vertical
stellar scale height. We apply this procedure to NGC 4314 and find that
prograde stellar orbits integrated in the potential are consistent with the
shape of the bar for a disk vertical scale height of $h = 350 \pm 100$ pc and a
corotation radius of $r=3.5 \pm 0.5$ kpc.
  We find that the inner $m=4$ Lindblad resonance is approximately at the
location of knob-like features seen near the end of the bar. The shape of
nearly closed orbits at this radius are lozenge or diamond shaped and have low
speeds along the major axis of the bar. The low speeds imply an increase in
density along the major axis of the bar. The angle of the major axis of the
$m=4$ component of the surface density begins to twist at the location of its
resonance, and the angle of the $m=2$ component begins to twist at a larger
radius near the corotation radius.

We present images of the barred galaxy NGC 7479 in the optical and near
infrared broad--bands $B,V,R,J,H,K$, and images in H$\alpha$+[N II] and
CO(J=1$\rightarrow$0) emission. The H$\alpha$ and CO emission in the bar are
coincident and confined to narrow linear features that are offset from the
center of the bar as observed in the near infrared. We estimate the
gravitational potential from the $K$ image, which provides an estimate of the
torque on the gas at the position of the CO emission in the bar. We find that
the implied gas inflow velocity derived from the torque is $10-20$ km s$^{-1}$.
Our inflow velocity is independent of the large streaming motions which can be
observed in CO and HI.

We provide a status report on our search for dark matter in our Galaxy in the
form of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs), using gravitational microlensing
of background stars. This search uses a very large CCD camera on the dedicated
1.27m telescope at Mt.~Stromlo, Australia, and has been taking data for 2
years. At present, we have analysed data for 8 million stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud over 1 year, resulting in one strong candidate event and two
lower-amplitude candidates. We have also analysed 5 million stars in the
Galactic Bulge for 0.5 years, yielding approximately 27 microlensing events.

We have constructed general relativistic models of a stationary, axially
symmnetric, Keplerian thin disk around a rotating black hole. We computed
profiles of a spectral line, emitted in the inner region of the disk. In our
models we have taken into account also the self-gravity of the disk. The aim of
this work is to study gravitational effects on the line profiles in connection
with the X-ray features observed in spectra of active galactic nuclei. In some
cases, the calculated profiles are clearly affected by the disk gravity but
relativistic dragging effects are found to be negligible.

We demonstrate that by making satellite-based parallax measurements of Macho
events, it is possible to distinguish disk from bulge Machos and to determine
individual masses of disk Machos to an accuracy of $0.2$ in the log. This is at
least a 3-fold improvement over what can be done without parallaxes, i.e., just
from the observed time scale of the events. In addition, we show that the
physical distribution of disk Machos can be found from `reduced' velocities
determined by parallax measurements.

We present HST images of 24 confirmed members of the distant galaxy cluster
Cl0016+16 at redshift 0.55. The Balmer-strong (``E+A'') and emission- line
galaxies frequently show unusual visual morphology, implying that galaxian
interactions produce ``active'' galaxies in moderate-redshift clusters. We use
the image concentration index as a quantitative measure of morphology to show
that these unusual galaxies appear disklike, while the normal red galaxies
resemble E/S0s. Although consistent with HST observations by Dressler et al. in
Cl0939+4713 ($z=0.41$), our results differ from the Couch et al. finding that
most Balmer-strong galaxies in AC114 ($z=0.31$) resemble ellipticals. The
entire ``E+A'' sample is small, but if future studies confirm their diversity,
it will suggest that they have different origins.

We present a new method for reconstructing the cosmological density, peculiar
velocity and peculiar gravitational potential on large scales from redshift
data. We remove the distorting effects of line-of-sight peculiar motions by
using the linear theory of gravitational instability, in which the potential is
the solution to a linear partial differential equation first derived by Kaiser.
We solve this equation by deriving its Green function; the Green functions for
the peculiar velocity and the real-space density follow directly.
Reconstruction of the cosmic fields is thus reduced to integration over
redshift space with the appropriate Green function kernel. Our algorithm has a
single input parameter, beta=Omega^0.6/b, where b is the linear bias factor and
Omega is the cosmological density parameter. We discuss the virtues of this
method for error control, for estimating beta, and for constraining the bias
mechanism.

A free-energy minimization approach is used to address the secular &
dynamical instabilities & the bifurcations along sequences of rotating,
self-gravitating fluid and stellar systems. Our approach stems from the
Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions. We focus on the Maclaurin sequence
of oblate spheroids & on the effects of second-harmonic disturbances.
Second-order phase transitions appear on the Maclaurin sequence also at the
points of dynamical instability & of bifurcation of the Dedekind sequence.
Distinguishing characteristic of each second-order phase transition is the
(non)conservation of an integral of motion (e.g. circulation) which determines
the appearance of the transition. Circulation is not conserved in stellar
systems because the stress-tensor gradient terms that appear in the Jeans
equations of motion include viscosity-like off-diagonal terms of the same order
of magnitude as the conventional pressure gradient terms. This explains why the
Jacobi bifurcation is a point of dynamical instability in stellar systems but
only a point of secular instability in viscous fluids. The second-order phase
transitions are discussed in relation to the dynamical instability of stellar
systems, the lambda-transition of liquid He-4, the second-order phase
transition in superconductivity & the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry
breaking.

The published properties of M1-78 are discussed with the purpose to resolve
the object's classification as either a planetary nebula or an ultracompact HII
region. A classification as a planetary nebula is rejected primarily because of
the high luminosity of the object, but because of the chemical composition and
expansion velocity of the nebula, a novel classification is proposed instead:
that of an ultracompact HII region with a post-main sequence central star
(possibly a WN star). It must therefore follow that observable ultracompact HII
regions persist beyond the main sequence lifetimes of at least some massive
stars, and so cannot be transient phenomena that are seen only during pre-main
sequence or early main sequence evolution.

We determine the velocity correlation function, pairwise peculiar velocity
difference, and root-mean-square pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion of rich
clusters of galaxies, as a function of pair separation, for three cosmological
models: Omega=1 and Omega=0.3 CDM, and Omega=0.3 PBI models (all flat and
COBE-normalized). We find that close cluster pairs, with separation r<10Mpc/h,
exhibit strong attractive peculiar velocities in all models; the cluster
pairwise velocities depend sensitively on the model. The mean pairwise
attractive velocity of clusters on 5Mpc/h scale ranges from 1700 km/s for
Omega=1 CDM, to 1000 km/s for PBI, to 700 km/s for Omega=0.3 CDM. The
small-scale pairwise velocities depend also on cluster mass: richer, more
massive clusters exhibit stronger attractive velocities than less massive
clusters. On large scales, from 20 to 200Mpc/h, the cluster peculiar velocities
are increasingly dominated by bulk and random motions; they are independent of
cluster mass. The cluster velocity correlation function, which reflects the
bulk motion minus the relative motion of pairs, is negative on small scales for
Omega=1 and Omega=0.3 CDM, and positive for PBI; this indicates stronger
pairwise motion than bulk motion on small scales for CDM, and relatively larger
bulk motions for PBI. The cluster velocity correlation function is positive on
very large scales, from 10 to 200Mpc/h, for all models. These positive
correlations, which decrease monotonically with scale, indicate significant
bulk motions of clusters up to 200Mpc/h. The strong dependence of the cluster
velocity functions on models, especially at small separations, makes them
useful tools in constraining cosmological models when compared with
observations.

We compute the angular two-point correlation functions of the gamma-ray
bursts at cosmological distances. Since the gamma-ray burst emission mechanism
is not yet established, we simply assume that the gamma-ray burst sources are
associated with high-redshift galaxies in some way. Then on the basis of
several simple models for the evolution of galaxy spatial correlations, we
calculate the amplitude of angular two-point correlation functions on scales
appropriate for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory data. we find that in most
cases the predicted correlations are difficult to detect with the current data
rate and the angular resolution, but models in which the bursts preferentially
occur at relatively low redshift ($z \simlt 0.5$) predict correlation
amplitudes on $\theta \sim 5^\circ$ which will be marginally detectable with
the Gamma Ray Observatory data in several years. If future observations detect
a signal of angular correlations, it will imply useful information on the
correlation of galaxies at high redshifts provided that the gamma-ray bursts
are cosmological.

The flare/spotted spectroscopic binary star CC Eri was observed with the
Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) on the X-ray satellite ROSAT on
1990 July 9-11 and 1992 January 26-27. During the observations, the source was
variable on time scales from a few minutes to several hours, with the X-ray
(0.2-2 keV) luminosity in the range $\sim 2.5-6.8\times 10^{29} erg s^{-1}$. An
X-ray flare-like event, which has a one hour characteristic rise time and a two
hour decay time, was observed from CC Eri on 1990 July 10 16:14-21:34 (UT). The
X-ray spectrum of the source can be described by current thermal plasma codes
with two temperature components or with a continuous temperature distribution.
The spectral results show that plasma at $Te\sim 10^{7}$ K exists in the corona
of CC Eri. The variations in the observed source flux and spectra can be
reproduced by a flare, adopting a magnetic reconnection model. Comparisons with
an unheated model, late in the flare, suggest that the area and volume of the
flare are substantially larger than in a solar two ribbon flare, while the
electron pressure is similar. The emission measure and temperature of the
non-flaring emission, interpreted as the average corona, lead to an electron
pressure similar to that in a well-developed solar active region. Rotational
modulation of a spot related active region requires an unphysically large X-ray
flux in a concentrated area.

Spectroscopic observations provide evidence that the optical transient object
observed in 1966 on archival plates of Sonneberg Observatory is a B=18.5 dMe
star. For an assumed flare duration of 40 min. (or longer) the flare amplitude
was $\bigtriangleup$m$_{B}$ $\approx$ 5.2 mag. If the recorded event was
belonging to the class of 'fast' flares its amplitude could have reached 7-9
mag.. We estimate a lower limit for the optical flare energy release of
10$^{35}$ (d/100 pc)$^2$ erg/s. We discuss the positional coincidence of this
large amplitude flaring star with the error box of the $\gamma$-ray burst 1978
October 6B and conclude that the flare star is probably not related to the
$\gamma$-ray burst. The fact that no other optical flare was found from this
object restricts their frequency to be less than 7$\times$10$^{-4}$ h$^{-1}$
for amplitudes (in B) greater than 4.5 mag. Nevertheless, large amplitude
flares constitute a serious background problem for the wide field search for
possible optical counterparts of $\gamma$-ray bursters.

Gravitational lensing provides a strict test of cosmogonic models. Detailed
numerical propagation of light rays through a universe having a distribution of
inhomogeneities derived from the standard CDM (cold dark matter) scenario with
the aid of massive, fully nonlinear computer simulations is used to test the
model. It predicts that we should have seen far more widely split quasar images
than have been found. These and other inconsistencies rule out the COBE
normalized CDM model with $\Omega=1$ and $H_0=50$km/s/Mpc; but variants of this
model might be constructed, which could pass the stringent tests provided by
strong gravitational lensing.

We propose that some of the unidentified Galactic plane (-10 degrees < b < 10
degrees) sources listed in the first EGRET catalog (Fichtel et al. 1994) are
associated with nearby supernova remnants. The probability that the association
of strong EGRET sources with supernova remnants is due to chance alignment is
found to be < 1/2200. Three of the most convincing associations are
radio-bright, nearby shell remnants and a fourth is associated with a plerion.
  We examine possible gamma-ray production mechanisms and conclude that pion
production and decay from high-energy protons interacting with the remnant gas
could produce the gamma rays.
  The energetics of this process are in accord with theories of cosmic ray
production through supernova shock acceleration.
  The identification of pion-decay features in the gamma-ray spectra of
supernova remnants would support this interpretation.

It has been claimed that in stellar winds traversed by strong shocks the
mechanism for driving the wind by sound wave pressure cannot operate because
sound waves cannot propagate past the shocks. It is shown here that sound waves
can propagate through shocks in one direction and that this is a sufficient
condition for the sound wave pressure mechanism to work. A strong shock
amplifies a sound wave passing through it and can drag the sound wave away from
the star. It is immaterial for the sound wave pressure gradient that the sound
wave vector points towards the star. Since the strong shocks drag the sound
waves away, the star itself is the source for the sound waves propagating
towards it.

We calculate the response of a line emitted from a relativistic accretion
disk to a continuum variation of the central illuminating source. This model
might be relevant to the very broad and sometimes redshifted emission lines
which have been observed at optical and X-ray energies in Active Galactic
Nuclei and X-ray binaries. We consider separately the cases of a point-like and
of an extended central source. Based on the first three moments of the line
energy distribution (i.e. the line intensity, centroid energy and width) and
the two-dimensional transfer function, we identify a number of characteristic
features, which can help assessing the presence of a relativistic accretion
disk and estimating its parameters. In particular, by combining an absolute
time measurement of the maximum of line response function with a relative
measurement in units of light crossing time the mass of the central object can
be derived.

We study the errors brought by finite volume effects and dilution effects on
the practical determination of the count probability distribution function
P_N(n,L), which is the probability of having N objects in a cell of volume L^3
for a set of average number density n. Dilution effects are particularly
relevant to the so-called sparse sampling strategy. This work is mainly done in
the framework of the scaling model (Balian \& Schaeffer 1989), which assumes
that the Q-body correlation functions obey the scaling relation xi_Q(K r_1,...,
K r_Q) = K^{-(Q-1) gamma} xi_N(r_1,..., r_Q). We use three synthetic samples as
references to perform our analysis: a fractal generated by a Rayleigh-L\'evy
random walk with 3.10^4 objects, a sample dominated by a spherical power-law
cluster with 3.10^4 objects and a cold dark matter (CDM) universe involving
3.10^5 matter particles.

The optical luminosity function is a fundamental characterization of the
galaxy population. A combination of earlier redshift surveys with two new
surveys allows the first accurate determination of the evolution of the
luminosity function with redshift, and reveals a marked steepening of the faint
end slope. This effect is more profound for star-forming galaxies - there are
5-10 times as many star-forming galaxies at z~0.5 as there are locally. These
results, together with high-resolution imaging and linewidth velocity
measurements, support the view that the excess of star-forming galaxies at
moderate redshift represents a general increase in the star-formation rate of
normal galaxies rather than a distinct new population. This increase in
star-formation appears in lower-L galaxies at lower redshift and only appears
in L* galaxies at z>0.5. Imaging studies provide indirect evidence which
suggests that interactions are responsible for a large part of this increased
activity.

The hierarchical triple system containing the millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26
in M4 is the first triple star system ever detected in a globular cluster. Such
systems should form in globular clusters as a result of dynamical interactions
between binaries. We propose that the triple system containing PSR B1620-26
formed through an exchange interaction between a wide primordial binary and a
{\it pre-existing\/} binary millisecond pulsar. This scenario would have the
advantage of reconciling the $\sim10^9\,$yr timing age of the pulsar with the
much shorter lifetime of the triple system in the core of M4.

Lensing of one member of a binary by its companion is studied for several
classes of binaries. For binaries in which at least one member is an ordinary
(non-compact) star, the optical depths to lensing is extremely low, $\tau\lsim
v_\esc^4/c^4\sim 10^{-11}$. Here $v_\esc$ is the escape velocity from the
component with the weaker potential. Binaries composed of two compact objects
can have higher optical depths. About 0.2\% of millisecond pulsar binaries will
be self-lensing. Such objects can be used to probe the pulsar-emission
mechanism.

We present an implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in an
adaptive-mesh PPPM algorithm. The code evolves a mixture of purely
gravitational particles and gas particles. The code retains the desirable
properties of previous PPPM--SPH implementations; speed under light clustering,
naturally periodic boundary conditions and accurate pairwise forces. Under
heavy clustering the cycle time of the new code is only 2--3 times slower than
for a uniform particle distribution, overcoming the principal disadvantage of
previous implementations\dash a dramatic loss of efficiency as clustering
develops. A 1000 step simulation with 65,536 particles (half dark, half gas)
runs in one day on a Sun Sparc10 workstation. The choice of time integration
scheme is investigated in detail. A simple single-step Predictor--Corrector
type integrator is most efficient. A method for generating an initial
distribution of particles by allowing a a uniform temperature gas of SPH
particles to relax within a periodic box is presented. The average SPH density
that results varies by $\sim\pm1.3$\%. We present a modified form of the
Layzer--Irvine equation which includes the thermal contribution of the gas
together with radiative cooling. Tests of sound waves, shocks, spherical infall
and collapse are presented. Appropriate timestep constraints sufficient to
ensure both energy and entropy conservation are discussed. A cluster
simulation, repeating Thomas and

General--relativistic, frequency--dependent radiative transfer in spherical,
differentially--moving media is considered. In particular we investigate the
character of the differential operator defined by the first two moment
equations in the stationary case. We prove that the moment equations form a
hyperbolic system when the logarithmic velocity gradient is positive, provided
that a reasonable condition on the Eddington factors is met. The operator,
however, may become elliptic in accretion flows and, in general, when gravity
is taken into account. Finally we show that, in an optically thick medium, one
of the characteristics becomes infinite when the flow velocity equals $\pm
c/\sqrt 3$. Both high--speed, stationary inflows and outflows may therefore
contain regions which are ``causally'' disconnected.

The present status of the ESO key-programme ``A Homogeneous Bright QSO
Survey'' is described together with the first results concerning the QSO counts
and the optical luminosity function. The related analysis of the evolution of
the radio and X-ray selected QSOs is presented.

We present results of surveys for high redshift field galaxies selected by
their having produced detectable absorption in the spectra of background QSOs.
Such surveys, in essence selected by gas cross-section rather than by flux
density, are almost completely independent of the conventional
magnitude--limited redshift survey, and allow one to follow objects of normal
luminosity well beyond $z\sim 1$, the redshift at which many of the standard
techniques break down. We summarize the principal results for our completed
survey at $z \le 1$, and give the preliminary results of a second survey
designed to extend the sample to $z=1.6$. A general conclusion is that normal
field galaxies exhibit strikingly little evolution in their space density,
luminosity, and optical/IR colors to redshifts as high as $z\sim 1.5$. We
discuss both the techniques involved and the implications of the results.

We present a comparison of the predictions of perturbation theory for the
hierarchical J-order correlation amplitudes $S_J=\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$,
$J=3-10$, with the results of large numerical simulations of gravitational
clustering. We consider two different initial power spectra of density
fluctuations, one being flatter than the other. The clustering amplitudes $S_J$
measured in these models are different at all scales. In each case, the
perturbation theory predictions give an excellent agreement with the
simulations on scales for which the variance is approximately linear, i.e. for
scales on which $\xibar_2 \simlt 1$. For cells of radius $R \simgt 30 \Mpc$,
the sampling variance arising from the finite size of our simulations dominates
the results. We also find that $S_J$ are roughly independent of time, $\Omega$,
or $\lambda$, as expected. On comparing with the observations, one can use
these results to discriminate between models for structure formation.

The reconstruction of the density profile in clusters of galaxies from the
distortion of the images of faint background galaxies is reconsidered. The
inversion formula of Kaiser \& Squires is known to provide a quantitative way
to perform this reconstruction; however, the practical application of this
formula faces two problems of principle (besides problems related to the
analysis of the observational data): (1) the shear distribution of a lens
cannot be inferred from the distortion of images, but only a combination of
shear and surface mass density can be observed. (2) The inversion formula is
exact only if one assumes observational data on the whole lens plane, whereas
in reality, the size of the data field is limited by the size of the CCD. We
have considered a possible solution to the first problem in a previous paper.
Here we consider the second problem. It is shown that the application of the
inversion formula to a finite data field induces systemmatic boundary effects.
An alternative inversion formula is derived, based on some recently published
results by Kaiser. We demonstrate, using synthetic data, that this new
inversion formula which does not require an extrapolation of the data beyond
the observed region, yields results which are comparable with those from the
Kaiser \& Squires inversion in their `noise levels', but lack the systemmatic
boundary effects.

We discuss the nature of non-LTE effects affecting abundance analysis of cool
stars. The departures from LTE of importance for the B I lines in solar-type
stars are described and some new results are presented. Boron abundances
derived under the LTE assumption have significant systematic errors, especially
for metal-poor stars. For beryllium, current results suggest that departures
from LTE will not affect abundance analysis significantly.

I propose a radical revision in the search strategy for Massive Compact
Objects (Machos) toward the Galactic bulge: monitor the entire $\sim 300$
square deg of the bulge and tune the search primarily to microlensing events of
bright $M_V\lsim 2$ stars. By employing a small second telescope to follow up
the events detected with low dimensionless impact parameter $\beta\lsim 0.2$,
one could measure the proper motion $\Omega$ of $\sim 10\,\rm yr^{-1}$ events
and significantly constrain $\Omega$ for a similar number. If, in addition, the
events were followed from a Macho parallax satellite, it would be possible to
measure individual masses, distances, and transverse velocities for the events
with proper motions. If a fraction $\xi$ of the bulge is composed of low-mass
objects in the range $10^{-3}\lsim M_{\rm low}/M_\odot\lsim 10^{-1}$, then mass
measurements could be made for $\sim 10(\xi/0.1)(0.01 M_\odot \VEV{M_{\rm
low}^{-1}})\,\rm yr^{-1}$ of these, thus allowing a direct measurement of the
mass function in the sub-stellar range. In the absence of a parallax satellite,
ground-based observations could significantly constrain (but not measure) Macho
parallaxes. These constraints, when combined with the proper-motion
measurements, would in turn constrain the mass, distance, and transverse speed
of the Machos. The proposed strategy should therefore be adopted even before a
parallax satellite is launched.

We present deep CCD surface photometry in the Gunn g, r, i system and
spectroscopy of the cD galaxy at the centre of the cluster A3284 at z = 0.15.
The brightness profile of the galaxy has been tracked up to 40 arcsec (142 kpc)
from the centre, and down to 26 mag/arcsec^2. The core and halo components in
the galaxy have been singled out deriving geometrical parameters of the fitting
isophotes as well as magnitudes and colours. The spectral properties of the
galaxy core indicate a stellar population super metal-rich with [Fe/H] = +0.5.
The cD halo is clearly dominant at 45 kpc from the galactic centre and has
exceedingly red colours (g-r = 1.03, g-i = 1.82), about 0.7 mag redder than the
core g-i. A match with the models for evolutionary population synthesis by
Buzzoni (1989) show that the halo is consistent with a population of unevolved
M-dwarf stars lower than 0.7 M_\odot. The M/L ratio in B for the halo is
estimated to range between 50 and 200 implying a total mass for the cD galaxy
of 1.6-3.1~10^{13} M_\odot and a total B luminosity of 6.0~10^{11} L_\odot.

We report the results of a detailed analysis of the contribution of various
classes of AGNs to the extragalactic X-ray background (XRB). The model is based
on the unification schemes of AGNs and on their related X-ray spectral
properties in the light of recent observational results. The integrated
emission from AGNs, when folded with an appropriate cosmological evolution law,
can provide a good fit to the XRB over a wide energy range, from several to
$\sim$ 100 keV, while it contributes only about 74\% of the ROSAT soft XRB. The
model predictions have been checked against all available observational
constraints from both hard and soft X-ray surveys (counts, redshift
distributions and average X-ray source spectral properties).

The BL Lac object 0716+714 is a powerful flat spectrum radio source detected
by CGRO-EGRET at $\gamma$-ray energies. It has been observed for about 21000 s
over two days by the X-ray telescope onboard the ROSAT satellite and strong
flux and spectral variations have been detected. In the time scale of two days
the source varied by a factor of $\sim 7$; during a sudden ($\sim 1000$ s) flux
increase, the variation was 70\%. 0716+714 exhibits spectral variations related
to source flux variability which may be attributed to a ``soft excess"
component most prominent when the source was in a low state. The spectrum of
0716+714 steepened in the soft X-ray band when the flux decreased while in the
hard X-ray band remained constant. A double power law model, representing steep
synchrotron radiation at low energies and flat inverse Compton radiation above
$\sim$ 1 keV, best fits both the low and high state.

The homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) is one of
the most severe constraint for theories of the structure formation in the
universe. We investigated the effect of the gravitational scattering (lensing)
of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and superclusters on the anisotropy of the
CBR by numerical simulations. Although this effect was thought to be
unimportant, we found that the gravitational scatterings by superclusters can
significantly reduce the anisotropy of the CBR. We took into account the
exponential growth of the distance between two rays due to multiple
scatterings. The bending angle of each ray grows through the random walk
process. On the other hand, difference between two rays grows exponentially
while it is small. This exponential growth is caused by coherent scatterings
that two rays suffer, and was neglected in the previous studies. The
gravitational scattering by superclusters reduces the observed temperature
anisotropy of the CBR at present time approximately by 40--60 $\%$ from that at
the recombination time for angular scale up to a few degrees if the
supercluster were formed at $z=$2--4.

We give an estimate of the relative error in the angular measurement of
observations for high redshift objects induced by gravitational scatterings
(lensing). Gunn (1967) concluded that the gravitational scatterings by galaxies
induce the relative error of a few percent in the observations for objects at
$z=1$. This estimate has been considered as a fundamental limitation of
accuracy of the angular measurements in the observational cosmology. In
multiple graviational scatterings, bending angle of single ray grows through
the random work process. Gunn (1967) assumed that the difference of nearby rays
also grows through the random walk process. However, distance between nearby
photons grows exponentially because the two rays suffer coherent scatterings by
the same scattering object. This exponential growth continues as long as the
scattering is coherent. In the case of scattering by individual galaxies, the
exponential growth continues until the angular distance reaches an arcminute or
so. The relative error of the angular measurements under an arcminute due to
the exponential growth is $\sim 30\%$ at $z=1$ and exceeds $100\%$ at $z=3$, in
the case that the density parameter of galaxies is 0.2. The effects of clusters
of galaxies or superclusters are more difficult to estimate accurately, but
might be significant. In the case of supercluster the angular measurements up
to a few degrees could be affected.

Low Surface-Brightness (LSB) galaxies are severely underrepresented in
surveys used to define the local luminosity function (LF), but could it in
principle be detected in deep surveys. To explore the possible contribution of
such objects to faint galaxy counts, we construct catalogs of simulated
non-evolving galaxies drawn from a multivariate distribution of galaxy
luminosities, central surface brightnesses, bulge/disk ratios and
spectral-energy distributions. We compare two models dominated by LSB galaxies
to a standard non-evolving model. Model galaxies are convolved with seeing and
selected in a manner that closely matches real surveys. For each model we
compute the local LF, HI mass function, number counts, redshift and color
distributions. We find it possible to include a large population of LSB
galaxies and incorporate a steep faint-end slope of the LF in our simulations
without violating the constraints on the local LF or HI mass function. For $q_0
= 0.5$, the most favorable model matches the counts to B=23, but falls short of
the observations at fainter magnitudes. The colors and redshift distributions
remain roughly consistent with observations to B=24. The most serious
discrepancy with observations is in the distribution of $r_e$ at faint
magnitudes, suggesting that the model contains too many LSB galaxies.
Nevertheless, the results suggest that LSB galaxies could be a significant
contributor to faint-galaxy counts, reducing the need for such extreme models
of galaxy evolution as rapid merging or bursting dwarf galaxies.

We show that a good fitting to the first two years of {\it COBE}-DMR
observations of the two-point angular correlation function of CBR temperature
is given by models with a non-zero infrared cutoff $k_{min}$ in the spectrum of
the primordial density perturbations. If this cutoff comes from the finiteness
of the universe, say, a topological T3 model, we find $k_{min} \sim (0.3 -
1.1)\pi$H$_0/c$ with confidence level 95\%. Such a non-zero $k_{min}$ universe
would also give a better match to the observations both of the RMS quadrupole
anisotropy of CBR and of galaxy clustering.

A star with main sequence mass greater than $25\sim 30\msun$ may collapse to
a black hole of about 10 $\msun$ at the final stage of the evolution. About an
order of 1\% of stellar mass is likely to be in form of such black holes in
galaxies. We have examined the dynamics of two-component stellar systems
composed of 0.7 $\msun$ main-sequence stars, representing the old population of
stars whose main-sequence lifetimes are longer than the Hubble time, and a
small fraction of 10 $\msun$ black holes. The dynamical friction leads to the
segregation of black holes to the core and the core collapse takes place among
the black holes in a time scale much shorter than that required for a single
component cluster. The ultimate evolution of the two-component stellar system
depends on the role of three-body binaries formed among the black holes. For a
system with $v\gta 100\kms$ binaries merge by gravitational radiation at some
hardness instead of being ejected. The critical hardness, at which the
collision time and the merger time become comparable, determines the efficiency
of the binary as a heat source. The efficiency is found to be inversely
proportional to the velocity dispersion. For the clusters without serious
reduction in heating efficiency (i.e., velocity dispersion well below 500
$\kms$), heating by three-body binaries have the effect of stopping the
core-collapse. The cluster

The mixed cold-hot dark matter cosmological model (CHDM) with
$\Omega_{tot}=1$ and a falling power-law initial spectrum of Gaussian adiabatic
perturbations ($n>1$) is tested using recent obserbational data. It is shown
that its fit to the data becomes worse with the growth of $n-1$, and may be
considered as unreasonable for $n>1.1$ for all possible values of the Hubble
constant. Thus, the CHDM model with a falling initial spectrum is worse than
the same model with the approximately flat $(|n-1|<0.1)$ spectrum. On the other
hand, the CHDM model provides a rather good fit to the data if $n$ lies in the
range $(0.9-1.0)$, the Hubble constant $H_0 < 60$ km/s/Mpc ($H_0 < 55$ for
$n=1$) and the neutrino energy density $\Omega_{\nu}< 0.25$. So, the CHDM model
provides the best possibility for the realization of the simplest variants of
the inflationary scenario having the effective slope $n\approx (0.95-0.97)$
between galaxy and horizon scales, including a modest contribution of
primordial gravitational wave background to large-angle $\Delta T/T$
fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (resulting in the increase of
their total {\it rms} amplitude by $(5-10)%$) expected in some variants. A
classification of cosmological models according to the number of fundamental
parameters used to fit observational data is presented, too.

We use the semi-analytic models of galaxy formation developed by Kauffmann,
White \& Guiderdoni to generate predictions for the observed properties of
cluster and group galaxies at redshifts between 0 and 0.6. We examine four sets
of cosmological initial conditions: low-density CDM models with and without
cosmological constant, a flat CDM model and a mixed dark matter model. These
models were selected because they span a wide range in cluster formation epoch.
The semi-analytic models that we employ are able to follow both the evolution
of the dark matter component of clusters and the formation and evolution of the
stellar populations of the cluster galaxies. We are thus able to generate model
predictions that can be compared directly with the observational data. In the
low-density CDM models, clusters form at high red- shift and accrete very
little mass at recent times. Our models predict that essentially no evolution
in the observed properties of clusters will have occurred by a redshift of 0.6,
in direct contradiction with the data. In contrast, in the MDM model, both
galaxies and clusters form extremely late. This model predicts evolution which
appears to be too extreme to be in agreement with the observations. The flat
CDM model, which is intermediate in structure formation epoch, is most
successful. This model is able to account for the evolution of the blue
fraction of rich clusters with redshift, the relationship between blue fraction
and cluster richness at different epochs, and the changes in the distribution
of the morphologies of cluster galaxies by a redshift of 0.4.

Infrared spectroscopic observations toward objects obscured by dense cloud
material show that H$_2$O, CO and, likely, CO$_2$ are important constituents of
interstellar ice mantles. In order to accurately calculate the column densities
of these molecules, it is important to have good measurements of their infrared
band strengths in astrophysical ice analogs. We present the results of
laboratory experiments to determine these band strengths. Improved experimental
methods, relying on simultaneous independent depositions of the molecule to be
studied and of the dominating ice component, have led to accuracies better than
a few percent. Furthermore, the temperature behavior of the infrared band
strengths of CO and H$_2$O are studied. In contrast with previous work, the
strengths of the CO, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O infrared features are found to depend
only weakly on the composition of the ice matrix, and the reversible
temperature dependence of the CO band is found to be weaker than previously
measured for a mixture of CO in H$_2$O.

With the imminent promise of constraints on the epoch of reionization from
observations of microwave background anisotropies, the question of whether or
not the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model permits early reionization has
been subjected to detailed investigation by various authors, with the
conclusion that reionization may occur at quite high redshift. However, it is
widely accepted that this model is excluded, as when normalised to the COBE
observations it possesses excessive galaxy clustering on scales below tens of
megaparsecs. We examine the trends of observations, first in a fairly model
independent way, and second by considering variants on the standard CDM model
introduced to resolve the observational conflicts. We conclude that the epoch
of reionization favoured by the observational data is typically considerably
later than the standard CDM model suggests, and amongst models which may fit
the observational data only the introduction of a cosmological constant leads
to a reionization redshift close to that of standard CDM.

We present the first results of a galaxy redshift survey, ESO Slice Project
(ESP), we are accomplishing as an ESO Key-Project over about 30 square degrees
in a region near the South Galactic Pole. The limiting magnitude is b_J = 19.4.
Observations have been almost completed and about 90% of the data obtained so
far has been reduced providing about 3000 galaxy redshifts. We present some
preliminary results concerning the large scale galaxy distribution and their
luminosity function.

Dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies, with blue absolute magnitudes typically
fainter than $M_B = -16$, are the most numerous type of galaxy in the nearby
universe. Tremendous advances have been made over the past several years in
delineating the properties of both Local Group satellite dE's and the large dE
populations of nearby clusters. We review some of these advances, with
particular attention to how well currently available data can constrain 1)
models for the formation of dE's, 2) the physical and evolutionary connections
between different types of galaxies (nucleated and nonnucleated dE's, compact
E's, irregulars, and blue compact dwarfs) that overlap in the same portion of
the mass-spectrum of galaxies, 3) the contribution of dE's to the galaxy
luminosity functions in clusters and the field, 4) the star-forming histories
of dE's and their possible contribution to faint galaxy counts, and 5) the
clustering properties of dE's. In addressing these issues, we highlight the
extent to which selection effects temper these constraints, and outline areas
where new data would be particularly valuable.

We present deep CCD photometry of a field in the newly discovered dwarf
spheroidal galaxy in Sagittarius (hereafter Sgr), and of a nearby control
field. These data (totaling ~3.5 hrs exposure time in V and I) were used to
produce color-magnitude (CM) diagrams reaching I ~ 22.3 in both fields. After
statistically removing the field-stars from the CM diagram we find that Sgr is
dominated by a moderately old (age ~ 10 Gyr) population, significantly younger
than a typical globular-cluster population. There is some evidence for a weak
intermediate-age component or alternatively a population of blue stragglers.
These results confirm that Sgr is a bona fide dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy,
the ninth found orbiting the Milky Way. We have discovered nine short-period
variables in the Sgr field, well in excess of the number found in the control
field. Seven of these stars have similar apparent magnitudes and are almost
certainly RR~Lyr stars in Sgr. We have used the minimum-light colors of the
RRab variables to determine the reddening of the Sgr field to be E\vi\ = 0.22.
For an assumed RR~Lyr luminosity of M_V = +0.6 we conclude that the distance of
Sgr is 25.2 +/- 2.8 kpc. The properties of the Sgr giant branch and upper main
sequence are consistent with a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.1 +/- 0.3.

Statistical moment-based ellipse fitting was performed on observations of
Large Magellanic Cloud clusters, confirming that trends are evident in their
position angles and ellipticities, as had been reported in the literature.
Artificial cluster images with known parameters were generated, and subjected
to the same analysis techniques, revealing apparent trends caused by stochastic
processes. Caution should therefore be exercised in the interpretation of
observational trends in young LMC clusters.

The age of globular clusters inferred from observations depends sensitively
on assumptions such as the initial helium abundance and the mass loss rate. A
high helium abundance (e.g., $Y\approx$0.28), as well as an inclusion of helium
diffusion and oxygen-enhancement in stellar models, can lower the current age
estimate for metal-poor globular clusters from 14$\pm 1.5$ Gyr to about 11$\pm
1$ Gyr, significantly relaxing the constraints on the Hubble constant, allowing
values as high as 60km/sec/Mpc for a universe with the critical density and
90km/sec/Mpc for a baryon-only universe. The uncertainties of a high helium
abundance and an instability strip induced mass loss near the turn-off in
globular clusters are discussed. Ages lower than 10 Gyr are not possible even
with the operation of both of these mechanisms unless the initial helium
abundance in globular clusters is $>0.28$, which can hardly be accomodated by
indirect inferences of helium abundances in globular clusters.

We propose a method of distance determination based on the internal structure
and dynamics of disk galaxies. The method relies on the universal luminosity
profile of a stellar disk represented by an exponential law. Calibrating nearby
galaxies with known distances, it is found that the scale length of the disk is
tightly correlated with the specific combination of central surface brightness
{\it and} rotational velocity at a characteristic radius of 2.15 scale lengths
from the center. This suggests that the scale length of the disk may be used as
an indicator for extragalactic distance scale. The application of this relation
to M51 and M100 allows us to arrive at the distances of about 6 Mpc and 14 Mpc,
respectively, implying a Hubble constant of $H_0 = 92 \sim 94$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$.

We present BV CCD-data for 11 intermediate-age LMC clusters; the main
conclusions are: 1. in the (V_to, V_cl,m) and (V-to, (V_to-V_cl,m)) planes the
models yield a good overall description of the data; 2. with the current
sample, it is impossible to firmly choose between "classical" and
"overshooting" models; 3. the separation in colour between the MS band and the
Red He-burning Clump is smaller than predicted by theoretical tracks; 4. the
existence of the so-called "RGB phase-transition (Renzini and Buzzoni 1986)
seems to be confirmed.

We report the results of the observations in the JHK bands of 12 globular
clusters in the LMC, and present CMDs down to K=16 for about 450 stars. We
merge the data with the BV ones presented in paper I and use the merged data to
study the evolution of integrated magnitudes and colours of SSPs. We find that
the AGB contributes about 60 percent of integrated clusters light in K, while
the contribution from RGB is correlated with the age of the cluster. The age at
which the first appearance of the RGB takes place depends on the models adopted
ranging from about 600 Myr in the "classical" models to about 1.5 Gyr with the
"overshooting" models. Both models give the same fractional contribution of the
RGB to the cluster light, in agreement with the Fuel Consumption Theorem. The
overall picture is consistent with the early conclusions of Persson et al. 1983
and Frogel et al. 1990 that J-K colour is driven by AGB stars, V-K is
controlled by AGB and RGB stars and B-V is partially influenced by the whole
population redder than the RGB clump, but is strongly dependent on the fading
and reddening of the TO stars with age.

This is the first of two papers presenting a detailed examination of
Fokker-Planck models for the globular cluster NGC 6397. I show that these
models provide a good match to observations of the surface density profile,
mass functions at three radii and the velocity dispersion profile. The
constraint of requiring the best matches to the mass functions and surface
density profiles to occur simultaneously defines a surface in an initial
parameter space consisting of the cluster concentration, mass, and limiting
radius. I discuss various techniques for locating this surface and the
dependence of the quality of the matches on the position of the model on the
surface, the initial mass function and the retention rate of neutron stars. The
quality of the matches are usually strongly related to the age of the models,
but one initial mass function was found for which the quality of the matches
are independent of time.

This is the second of two papers presenting a detailed examination of
Fokker-Planck models for the globular cluster NGC 6397 and is concerned with
extracting information on the cluster from the models. The models give a
current cluster mass of $6.6\pm 0.5\times 10^4 \Msolar$ of which about 2500
\Msolar\ is in neutron stars. This mass gives a $V$-band mass-to-light ratio of
1.2 in solar units. The models and data provide weaker estimates of the
structural parameters, but suggest that the core radius is less than 0.3 pc
(11\arcsec) and the tidal radius is $17\pm 4$ pc. In turn, by assuming a flat
rotation curve for the galaxy, the mass and tidal radius suggest that the
latter was set at a distance of 2.5 kpc from the galactic center.

The origin and evolution of structure in the Universe is one of the major
questions occupying astronomers today. An understanding of the Lyalpha
absorbers seen in QSO spectra is an important part of this program since such
absorbers can be traced back to very high redshifts. Their mere existence
places constraints on the physical state of the intergalactic medium. The
discovery of Lyalpha absorbers at low redshift allows us to estimate for the
first time what fraction of low redshift Lyalpha absorbers are (i) randomly
distributed, (ii) distributed like galaxies but not physically associated with
luminous objects, (iii) actually part of the halos of luminous galaxies, or
(iv) tidal tails within galaxy groups. Results from the sightline to the QSO
3C273 suggest that the majority of the absorbers are not associated with
galaxies, but that there is a significant subset that are. The absorbers
associated with galaxies may be produced in enormous gaseous disks surrounding
normal spiral galaxies, or may be tidal material bound up in small groups of
galaxies

We propose a new method that can be used to constrain the properties of the
Galactic bar (bulge). If the majority of the lensing objects are in the
Galactic bar, then we predict a systematic offset in the apparent magnitude
between lensed stars and all observed stars. Using OGLE color-magnitude diagram
data we model this effect in the region of the diagram dominated by bulge red
clump stars and find that for some models of the Galactic bar the expected
offset in the apparent magnitude may be as large as $0.2 mag$. About 100 lensed
stars in the red clump region of the color-magnitude diagram is needed to
unambiguously detect this effect, a number within the reach of current
microlensing projects. We find a good correlation between the extent of the bar
along the line of sight and the expected magnitude offset. We also obtain a
constraint for the extent of the bar along the line of sight using the observed
luminosity function for the red clump stars.

We use numerical models which include star formation to analyze the mass
profiles of remnants formed by mergers of disk galaxies. During a merger,
dissipation in gas and ensuing star formation leave behind a dense stellar core
in the remnant. Rather than joining smoothly onto a de Vaucouleurs profile, the
starburst population leads to a sharp break in the surface density profile at a
few percent the effective radius. While our results are preliminary, the lack
of such signatures in most elliptical galaxies suggests that mergers of
gas-rich disk galaxies may not have contributed greatly to the population of
present-day ellipticals.

We present the first self-consistently computed results on the evolution of
X-ray properties of galaxy clusters in a Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) model.
We have performed a hydrodynamic plus N-body simulation for the COBE-compatible
CHDM model with standard mass components: Omega(hot) = 0.3, Omega(cold) = 0.6
and Omega(baryon) = 0.1 (h = 0.5). In contrast with the CDM model, which fails
to reproduce the observed temperature distribution function dN/dT (Bryan et al.
1994b), the CHDM model fits the observational dN/dT quite well. Our results on
X-ray luminosity are less firm but even more intriguing. We find that the
resulting X-ray luminosity functions at redshifts z = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7 are
well fit by observations, where they overlap. The fact that both temperatures
and luminosities provide a reasonable fit to the available observational data
indicates that, unless we are missing some essential physics, there is neither
room nor need for a large fraction of gas in rich clusters: 10% (or less) in
baryons is sufficient to explain their X-ray properties. We also see a tight
correlation between X-ray luminosity and gas temperature.

Atmospheric extinction in the V passband at Mount John University
Observatory, New Zealand, from 1987-94 is presented and the effect of the 1991
Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption is discussed.

(\rl = Richardson-Lucy) We propose a simulation-based bootstrap method to
access global significance levels of deconvolution models in the \rl and other
iterative restoration algorithms that converge locally. These significance
levels allow one to check at each iterative step how good the model is and when
iterations can be stopped. Adding more iterations in the deconvolution improves
the fitting but is very slow at later time; while too much entropy or
smoothness will be lost in the models. A good deconvolution model should
firstly have a significance level as high as possible ($\ge$ 20\%), and
secondly, be as smooth as possible. We have used two examples to illustrate how
such models can be derived in practice. We point out that maximizing the sum of
the likelihood of fitting and {\em a priori} entropy does not guarantee an
acceptable significance level for the resulting model. If one's {\em a priori}
knowledge is too poor, the model may not be able to fit the data at a
reasonable significance level. Instead, a maximum-entropy-like iterative
restoration algorithm can be performed later by acquiring {\em a priori}
knowledge from the \rl restoration. However, this is necessary only when it
does increase the levels significantly.

I outline the connections between some of the most widely used statistical
measures of galaxy clustering and the fundamental issues in the theory of
structure formation. I devote particular attention to the problem of biasing,
i.e. to a possible difference between the distribution of galaxies and the
distribution of mass. Using numerical experiments, I show that a local
morphology-density relation leads to different slopes and amplitudes for the
correlation functions of different galaxy types on small scales, but that the
correlation functions on large scales all have the same shape, differing only
by constant factors. I also examine a variety of biasing models in which the
efficiency of galaxy formation depends on local properties of the mass
distribution. While these purely local influences do lead to a large-scale
bias, in all cases the bias factor becomes constant on scales larger than the
galaxy correlation length.

One of the puzzles in understanding the spectra of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) is the origin of the FeII emission. FeI emission, if present, will help
reveal the physical conditions of the emitting gas. In an attempt to verify the
presence of FeI lines, high S/N spectra of two FeII-strong quasars, IRAS
07598-6508 and PHL 1092, were obtained at the Multiple Mirror Telescope and the
Steward 2.3 m Telescope. We have identified emission lines of FeI and TiII. The
source of energy for FeII, FeI and TiII emission is probably not from
ionization by the photon continuum, but heat. The high rate of energy
generation and the presence of both high and low velocity gas indicate that the
heat is generated not over a large area, but a narrow band in accretion disk,
in which the rotational speed decreases rapidly.

Recent claims in the literature (Bressan, Chiosi & Fagotto 1994) that the
epoch describing the onset of galactic winds in spheroidal star systems has
been severely overestimated in the past, due to the neglect of energy deposited
in the interstellar medium from stellar winds, is evaluated in the light of a
more conservative approach to modeling the input of thermal energy to the
system from massive stars undergoing mass loss. Applying the most recent models
of stellar kinetic energy deposition, coupled with reasonable assumptions
regarding the efficiency of thermalisation, it is shown that contrary to the
aforementioned study, the influence of stellar winds in driving the galactic
winds in ellipticals of mass M_G>1e9 M_Sun is most likely negligible.

The classical processes: the conversion of photons into gravitons in the
static electromagnetic fields are considered by using Feynman perturbation
techniques. The differential cross sections are presented for the conversion in
the electric field of the flat condesor and the magnetic field of the selenoid.
A numerical evaluation shows that the cross sections may have the observable
value in the present technical scenario.

Here follows a preliminary report on the construction of fake millimeter and
sub-millimeter skies, as observed by virtual instruments, e.g. the COBRA/SAMBA
mission, using theoretical modeling and data extrapolations. Our goal is to
create maps as realistic as possible of the relevant physical contributions
which may contribute to the detected signals. This astrophysical modeling is
followed by simulations of the measurement process itself by a given
instrumental configuration. This will enable a precise determination of what
can and cannot be achieved with a particular experimental configuration, and
provide a feedback on how to improve the overall design. It is a key step on
the way to define procedures for the separation of the different physical
processes in the future observed maps. Note that this tool will also prove
useful in preparing and analyzing current (\eg\ balloon borne) Microwave
Background experiments. Keywords: Cosmology -- Microwave Background
Anisotropies.

Major axis rotation curves and velocity dispersions profiles, extending out
to about one effective radius, are presented for 15 ellipticals and S0's out of
the photometric sample of Fornax cluster galaxies studied by Caon \etal\
(1994). A brief description of the spectroscopic and photometric
characteristics of each galaxy is provided, together with a comparison with
previous studies. Six of the nine E's are possibly misclassified S0's or
ellipticals harboring a disk-like component. Two galaxies (NGC~1399 and 1404)
show a hint of counter-rotation. Evidence is given that the \bright\ and the
\ordinary\ families of early-type galaxies, first introduced by Capaccioli
\etal\ (1992), look distinct also in term of the anisotropy parameter
$(\Vm/\sigma)^*$.

Big bang nucleosynthesis constraints on baryon isocurvature perturbations are
determined. A simple model ignoring the effects of the scale of the
perturbations is first reviewed. This model is then extended to test the claim
that large amplitude perturbations will collapse, forming compact objects and
preventing their baryons from contributing to the observed baryon density. It
is found that baryon isocurvature perturbations are constrained to provide only
a slight increase in the density of baryons in the universe over the standard
homogeneous model. In particular it is found that models which rely on power
laws and the random phase approximation for the power spectrum are incompatible
with big bang nucleosynthesis unless an {\em ad hoc}, small scale cutoff is
included.

The surface of a spinning liquid takes the shape of a paraboloid that can be
used as a reflecting mirror. This very old and nearly forgotten concept has
recently been revived and I review its present status. Extensive
interferometric tests of liquid mirrors (the largest one having a diameter of
2.5-meters ) show excellent optical qualities. I discuss the factors that can
limit the optical quality of liquid mirrors, how to minimize them as well as
the basic technology. A handful of liquid mirrors have now been built that are
used for scientific work. I show representative data obtained from 2.65-m
diameter liquid mirror telescopes used for astronomy and the atmospheric
sciences (lidar). Section 5, of particular interest to cosmologists, or
astronomers using surveys, examines the expected performance of 4-m liquid
mirror telescopes dedicated to cosmological surveys. It is rather impressive,
due to the fact that the instruments work full- time on four-year surveys:
Spectrophotometry reaches B=24 for all objects within over 100 square degrees
and wide-band photometry reaches about B=28. I consider the future of liquid
mirror telescopes: limits to their sizes, engineering issues as well as
speculations on lunar or space LMTs. I briefly mention the possibility of
non-rotating GRIN liquid mirrors. Finally I address the issues of the field
accessible to LMTs equipped with novel optical correctors. Optical design work,
and some exploratory laboratory work, indicate that a single LMT should be able
to access, with excellent images, small regions anywhere inside fields

We describe an accurate, one-dimensional, spherically symmetric, Lagrangian
hydrodynamics/gravity code, designed to study the effects of radiative cooling
and photo-ionization on the formation of protogalaxies. The code can treat an
arbitrary number of fluid shells (representing baryons) and collisionless
shells (representing cold dark matter). As a test of the code, we reproduce
analytic solutions for the pulsation behavior of a polytrope and for the
self-similar collapse of a spherically symmetric, cosmological perturbation. In
this paper, we concentrate on the effects of radiative cooling, examining the
ability of collapsing perturbations to cool within the age of the universe. In
contrast to some studies based on order-of- magnitude estimates, we find that
cooling arguments alone cannot explain the sharp upper cutoff observed in the
galaxy luminosity function.

The conjecture that energy transport in sunspot penumbrae occurs through
convection by an interchange of magnetic flux tubes is used in order to
construct a magnetostatic model for a deep penumbra which is part of a global
sunspot model. The model describes an overall mechanical equilibrium between
the three stratifications: of the umbra, the penumbra, and of the quiet sun,
all of them being treated as stellar like envelopes. Local differences between
the gas pressure in the neighbouring stratifications are balanced by the
magnetic forces confined to two current sheets: the magnetopause and the
peripatopause, whose shapes are determined by the solution of a free boundary
problem. A self consistent coupling between global magnetostatic and thermal
equilibrium is achieved by the assumption of a perfect thermal isolation of the
umbra and a parametrized inflow of the heat into the penumbra. Characteristic
parameters observed in sunspots have been imposed as surface constraints for
the model. Then only models with a total magnetic flux larger than about
3x10^21 Mx turn out to be feasible. Smaller tubes would require more heat flux
than is available in the solar convection zone if they contained an extended
penumbra. The solutions obtained indicate that the penumbra contains 50-60% of
the total magnetic flux of the spot and has a depth comparable with half the
radius of the spot. About 60% of the solar heat flux impinging on the
magnetopause seems to be transmitted into the penumbra and conveyed to the
photosphere by the interchange convection which can be maintained if the
average inclination of the magnetic field exceeds about 30deg. Such a penumbra
forming an extended

The dynamical evidence for black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei is reviewed,
with emphasis on recent improvements in spatial resolution, methods for
analyzing galaxy spectra and dynamical modeling. M31, M32 and M87 are discussed
in some detail.

Synthetic spectra of Arcturus computed with the latest theoretical stellar
atmospheres disagree strongly with both the spectral energy distribution and
with the spectroscopic data for $\lambda < 4000$ \AA , even though the stellar
parameters are well constrained. We find that the discrepancy can be removed by
adding a continuous absorption opacity that is approximately equal to that
which is already included in the {\sc atlas9} code. Spectroscopy of other
  K2 III stars shows that the spectrum of Arcturus in not anomalous. Therefore,
missing opacity may be a common feature of the models for stars in this
temperature and luminosity range.

Iron abundance distribution is now known for 12 clusters of galaxies. For
some clusters (e.g. Centaurus) the observed abundance increases toward the
cluster center, while for the others (e.g. Coma and Hydra-A) no significant
inhomogeneity was observed. In order to understand this difference, we
investigate the influence of cooling flow and turbulence produced by galactic
motion on the iron abundance distribution by simple spherical models. We show
that the cooling flow has a significant effect to flatten the iron abundance
distribution if the flow velocity is sufficiently large. Further, by applying
our analysis to the above clusters we show that we can give a systematic
account for the observed variety of the iron abundance distribution
qualitatively.

Fifteen variable stars have been discovered during four nights of monitoring
of NGC 7789. It was possible to determine periods for ten of these variables.
Seven objects are W UMa-type binaries, in this number five are members of the
cluster. Among the remaining variables, there are three further close binaries,
one delta Scuti which is a Blue Straggler in the cluster, and one multi-modal
variable (with indeterminable periods). One of the binaries showed an
eclipse-like event; this binary is a good candidate for determination of masses
of its components at the turn-off point of the cluster.

Recent observations of microlensing events in the Large Magellanic Cloud by
the MACHO and EROS collaborations suggest that an important fraction of the
galactic halo is in the form of Massive Halo Objects (MHO) with mass $\sim 0.1
M_{\odot}$. We outline a scenario in which dark clusters of MHO with mass $\sim
0.1 M_{\odot}$ and $H_2$ molecular clouds form in the halo at galactocentric
distances larger than $\sim$ 10 - 20 kpc, provided baryons are a major
constituent of the halo. Possible signatures of our picture are discussed.

Estimates indicate there may be $\simgreat 10^3$ low luminosity X-ray pulsars
($L \simless 10^{34} \rom{erg\;s^{-1}}$) in the Galaxy undergoing ``low-state''
wind accretion in Be/X-ray binary systems, and $\sim 10^8-10^9$ isolated
neutron stars which may be accreting directly from the interstellar medium.
Despite their low effective temperatures ($kT_e \simless 300 \rom{eV}$), low
luminosity accreting neutron stars with magnetic fields $B \sim (0.7-7) \times
10^{12}$ G could emit a substantial fraction ($0.5 - 5\%$) of their total
luminosity in a moderately broadened ($E/\Delta E \sim 2-4$) cyclotron {\it
emission} line which peaks in the energy range $ \sim 5-20\rom{keV}$. The bulk
of the thermal emission from these stars will be in the extreme
ultraviolet/soft X-ray regime, which is subject to strong interstellar
absorption and would be difficult to distinguish from spectra of other types of
objects. In sharp contrast, the {\it nonthermal} cyclotron component predicted
here will not be strongly absorbed, and consequently it may be the only
distinguishing signature for the bulk of these low luminosity sources. We
propose a search for this cyclotron emission feature in long pointed
observations of the newly discovered candidate isolated neutron star
MS0317.7-6477, and the Be/X-ray transient

We present clustering measurements for samples of galaxies selected by
morphological type and luminosity from the recently completed Stromlo-APM
Redshift Survey. Early type galaxies are clustered more strongly by a factor
3.5--5.5, than late type galaxies. Low-luminosity galaxies are clustered more
weakly by a factor of $\sim 2$ than $L^*$ and brighter galaxies on scales
$\simgt 1\hMpc$. Also the slope of the correlation function is steeper for
low-luminosity galaxies, so that the amplitude is a factor 4 lower at $ 10
\hMpc$. No difference, however, is seen between the clustering of $L^*$ and
more luminous galaxies, an observation which may be hard to reconcile with some
theories of biased galaxy formation. Both redshift-space and real-space
clustering estimates show a similar dependence on luminosity.

We discuss a family of two-mirror correctors that can greatly extend the
field accessible to a fixed telescope such as a liquid mirror telescope. The
performance of the corrector is remarkable since it gives excellent images in
patches contained within a field greater than 45 degrees. We argue that this
performance makes fixed telescopes competitive with tiltable ones.

In order to carry out a systematic and thorough measurement of the HI
Gunn-Peterson effect at high redshift, a quantitatively testable and repeatable
procedure, in particular, a robust statistical weighting technique, is
developed. It is applied to an echelle spectrum of resolution 15 km s$^{-1}$ of
PKS 1937-101 with z=3.787. A weighted intensity distribution which is derived
overwhelmingly from pixels close to the continuum level in the Ly alpha forest
region is constructed by the evaluation of how closely correlated each pixel is
with its neighboring pixels. The merit of the distribution is its stronger and
narrower peak compared to the unweighted, as well as its smaller dependence on
uncertainty of strong absorption lines and noise spikes. By comparison to the
weighted intensity distribution of synthetic Ly alpha forest spectrum with
various chosen diffuse HI opacities, a chi square fit is performed. In addition
to a weak line population with power law N_H distribution $\beta =1.7$
extrapolated down to 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, a best chi square fit requires a GP
opacity of $0.115 \pm 0.025$ at average z=3.4 with estimation of the
contribution from the variance of $\beta$. Although no evidence of more than
1-2\% error is seen in the continuum extrapolation, the possible systematic
overestimation due to the slope can be as high as the level of the $\chi^2$
fit, which is investigated by splitting the \Lya forest region into subsamples
to check the continuum drop's dependence on absorber redshift.

The high state of black hole candidates is characterized by a quasi- thermal
emission component at $kT \sim 1$ keV. In addition, this state tends to have
very low variability which indicates that it is relatively stable, at least on
{\it short} time scales. Most models of the high state imply that the bulk of
the emission comes from an optically thick accretion disc; therefore, this
state may be an excellent laboratory for testing our ideas about the physics of
accretion discs. In this work we consider the implications of assuming that
accretion disc viscosity arises from some form of turbulence. Specifically, we
consider the simple case of three dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence. It is
found that the coupling of such turbulence to acoustic modes in the disc can
alter the disc emission. We calculate the amplitude and frequencies of this
modulation, and we express our results in terms of the X-ray power spectral
density. We compare our calculations with observations of the black hole
candidate GS 1124-683, and show that for certain parameters we can reproduce
some of the high frequency power. We then briefly explore mechanisms for
producing the low frequency power, and note the difficulty that a single
variability mechanism has in reproducing the full range of observed
variability. In addition, we outline ways in which future spacecraft missions
-- such as USA and XTE -- can further constrain our model, especially at
frequencies above $\sim 10^2$ Hz.

Damped Ly$\alpha$ systems provide possibly the most significant evidence for
early structure formation, and thus a stringent constraint on the Cold + Hot
Dark Matter (CHDM) cosmology. Using the numbers of halos in N-body simulations
to normalize Press-Schechter (PS) estimates of the number densities of
protogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that CHDM with
$\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the damped
Ly$\alpha$ data only at $z<2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with data
at $z>3$. The predictions of CHDM are quite sensitive to the neutrino fraction.
We find that $\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b = 0.725/0.20/0.075$ is compatible
with the $z>3$ data. With one massive neutrino species, this corresponds to
lowering the neutrino mass from 7.0 to 4.7 eV, for $H_0=50\kmsMpc$ and
$T=2.726$ K. By analysing our numerical simulations with different resolutions
and box sizes as well as those of Ma \& Bertchinger (1994), we show that for
the CHDM models with $\Omega_\nu$=0.2--0.3 the PS approximation should be used
with Gaussian filter with $\delta_c=1.3-1.4$ if one tries to recover the total
mass of a collapsed halo and to include nonlinear effects, due to waves both
longer and shorter than those within the simulation box.

Stellar and nebular abundance indicators reveal that there exists significant
abundance fluctuations in the interstellar medium (ISM) of gas-rich galaxies.
It is shown that at the present observed solar level of O/H $\sim 6 \times
10^{-4}$, abundance differences of a factor of two, such as existing between
the Sun and the nearby Orion Nebula, are many times larger than expected.
  We examine a variety of hydrodynamical processes operating at scales ranging
from 1 pc to greater than 10 kpc, and show that the ISM should appear better
homogenized chemically than it actually is: $(i)$ on large galactic scales (1
$\geq\ l\ \geq$ 10 kpc), turbulent diffusion of interstellar clouds in the
shear flow of galactic differential rotation is able to wipe out azimuthal O/H
fluctuations in less than $10^9$ yrs; $(ii)$ at the intermediate scale (100
$\geq\ l\ \geq$ 1000 pc), cloud collisions and expanding supershells driven by
evolving associations of massive stars, differential rotation and triggered
star formation will re-distribute and mix gas efficiently in about $10^8$ yrs;
$(iii)$ at small scales (1 $\geq\ l\ \geq$ 100 pc), turbulent diffusion may be
the dominant mechanism in cold clouds, while Rayleigh-Taylor and
Kelvin-Helmhotz instabilities quickly develop in regions of gas ionized by
massive stars, leading to full mixing in

We present some of the results of a large survey aimed at establishing the
properties of galaxies selected by their having produced detectable Mg~II
$\lambda\lambda 2796$, 2803 absorption in the spectra of background QSOs. The
present sample covers the redshift range $0.2 \le z \le 1.0 $, with $\langle z
\rangle = 0.65$. From an extensive program of optical and near-IR imaging and
optical spectroscopy, we find that the galaxies appear to be similar to normal
galaxies at the present epoch, ranging from late--type spiral galaxies to those
whose spectra and colors resemble present--day ellipticals. Contrary to some
faint field galaxy samples selected using different criteria, over the redshift
range observed we find no evidence for significant evolution in rest--frame
$B-K$ color, space density, or (rest--frame $B$ or $K$) luminosity. The
``average'' Mg~II absorbing galaxy appears to be consistent with a normal
0.7$L_B^{\ast}$ Sb galaxy having a roughly constant star formation rate since
$z \sim 1$, although galaxies spanning a range of a factor of $\sim 70$ in
luminosity are found in the absorber sample. The diffuse gas cross-section
selection imposed by studies of this kind appears to be biased {\it against}
the relatively underluminous, blue galaxies which apparently dominate the
number counts at faint magnitudes. However, essentially all ``normal'' field
galaxies, independent of spectroscopic type, appear to be potential QSO
absorbers.

A technique for the construction of axisymmetric distribution functions for
individual galaxies is presented. It starts from the observed surface bright-
ness distribution, which is deprojected to gain the axisymmetric luminosity
density, from which follows the stars' gravitational potential. After adding
dark mass components, such as a central black hole, the two-integral distribu-
tion function (2I-DF) f(E,Lz), which depends only on the classical integrals of
motion in an axisymmetric potential, is constructed using the Richardson- Lucy
algorithm. This algorithm proved to be very efficient in finding f(E,Lz)
provided the integral equation to be solved has been properly modified. Once
the 2I-\df\ is constructed, its kinematics can be computed and compared with
those observed. Many discrepancies may be remedied by altering the assumed
inclination angle, mass-to-light ratio, dark components, and odd part of the
2I-DF. Remaining discrepancies may indicate, that the distribution function
depends on the non-classical third integral, or is non-axisymmetric.
  The method has been applied to the nearby elliptical galaxy M32. A 2I-DF with
~55 degrees inclination and a central black hole (or other compact dark mass
inside ~1pc) of 1.6-2*10^6 Msun fits the high-spatial-resolution kinema- tic
data of van der Marel et al. remarkably well. 2I-DFs with a significantly less
or more massive central dark mass or with edge-on inclination can be ruled out
for M32. Predictions are made for HST-observations: spectroscopy using its
smallest square aperture of 0.09"*0.09" should yield a non-gaussian central
velocity profile with broad wings, true and gaussian-fit velocity dispersion of
150-170km/s and 120-130km/s, respectively.

We study big bang nucleosynthesis in the presence of large mass-scale,
non-linear entropy fluctuations. Overdense regions, with masses above the local
baryon-Jeans mass, are expected to collapse and form condensed objects.
Surviving nucleosynthesis products therefore tend to originate from underdense
regions. We compute expected surviving light element ($^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He,
$^7$Li) abundance yields for a variety of stochastic fluctuation spectra. In
general, we find that spectra with significant power in fluctuations on length
scales below that of the local baryon Jeans mass produce nucleosynthesis yields
which are in conflict with observationally inferred primordial abundances.
However, when this small scale structure is absent or suppressed, and the
collapse efficiency of overdense regions is high, there exists a range of
fluctuation spectral characteristics which meet all primordial abundance
constraints. In such models abundance constraints can be met even when the
pre-collapse baryonic fraction of the closure density is $\Omega_b\approx
0.2h^{-2}$($h$ is the Hubble parameter in units of 100 km\ s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$).
Nucleosynthesis in these models is characterized by high $^2$H/H and low $^4$He
mass fraction relative to a homogeneous big bang at a given value of
$\Omega_bh^2$. A potentially observable signature of these models is the
production of intrinsic primordial abundance variations on baryon mass-scales
up to $10^{10}M_{\odot}-10^{12}_{\odot}$.

A short discussion is provided on the hypothesis of strange quark dust of low
specific charge in the terrestrial magnetosphere. We suggest by means of rough
estimates the possible existence of a strangelet belt in the magnetosphere.

We obtained a new spectrum for the radio galaxy Pictor~A in December 1993.
Comparison with previous data obtained in 1983 and 1987 shows that the broad
component of the Balmer lines has increased considerably in strength and
complexity. The Balmer lines now show a boxy, double peaked profile with
FWZI$\sim$24000 \kms. Although the 1993 H\a\ profile is reminiscent of
Arp~102B, accretion disk models face immediate difficulty because (1) the
redshifted peak in the profile is considerably stronger than the blue one, and
(2) the red and blue peaks varied at different epochs. The latter finding
strongly favors a predominance of radial motion. We argue that Pictor~A, and
the rare objects with similar extremely broad emission line profiles, are
better understood if the orientation is such that the gas is predominantly
moving along the line of sight (i.e.\ a geometrical extremum).

We discuss the rationale and the present status of a large redshift survey
aiming at measuring distances for all the clusters of galaxies detected by the
ROSAT X--ray All--Sky Survey in the southern hemisphere, with flux larger than
$\sim 2\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. The survey is being performed
using three ESO telescopes in parallel. The final sample will contain about 700
clusters. It will represent a unique database for the study of the spatial
distribution of clusters, their X--ray luminosity function and their intrinsic
physical properties. Serendipitous results obtained so far include two new
gravitational arc systems in two clusters of galaxies. These findings, obtained
on rather short exposures, confirm the advantage of searching for arcs in
X--ray selected clusters.

The fundamental tenet of the classical supernovae-driven wind model of
elliptical galaxies is that the residual thermal energy of all supernovae
remnants (SNRs) provide sufficient energy to overcome the binding energy of the
remaining interstellar gas, thereby driving a global galactic wind. We
re-examine model predictions of this epoch of wind ejection t_GW, highlighting
a heretofore underappreciated sensitivity to the adopted remnant thermal energy
formalism, and illustrating cases in which previous work may have substantially
overestimated t_GW. Arguments based upon chemical evolution alone, put forth to
reject the hypothesis of dark matter distributions similar to the luminous
component in spheroids, are shown to be tenuous. Finally, the predicted
enrichment of intracluster gas during the wind phase of cluster ellipticals,
and its relation to the selected SNR interior thermal energy evolutionary
scheme, is addressed. Despite the success of previous wind models, our results
still call into question the correctness of the simple analytical approach used
thus far, and imply that a more appropriate technique should be adopted in the
future.

Current limits on the intensity of the extragalactic infrared background are
consistent with the expected contribution from evolving galaxies. Depending on
the behaviour of the star formation rate and of the initial mass function, we
can expect that dust extinction during early evolutionary phases ranges from
moderate to strong. An example of the latter case may be the ultraluminous
galaxy IRAS F$10214 + 4724$. The remarkable lack of high redshift galaxies in
faint optically selected samples may be indirect evidence that strong
extinction is common during early phases. Testable implications of different
scenarios are discussed; ISO can play a key role in this context. Estimates of
possible contributions of galaxies to the background under different
assumptions are presented. The COBE/FIRAS limits on deviations from a blackbody
spectrum at sub-mm wavelengths already set important constraints on the
evolution of the far-IR emission of galaxies and on the density of obscured
(``Type 2'') AGNs. A major progress in the field is expected at the completion
of the analysis of COBE/DIRBE data.

Invited review given at special session on Digitizing the Sky at 1994 Summer
AAS meeting, Minnesota.

The core of a neutron star contains several species of particles, whose
relative equilibrium concentrations are determined by the local density. As the
star spins down, its centrifugal force decreases continuously, and the star
contracts. The density of any given fluid element increases, changing its
chemical equilibrium state. The relaxation towards the new equilibrium takes a
finite time, so the matter is not quite in chemical equilibrium, and energy is
stored that can be released by reactions. For a neutron star core composed of
neutrons (n), protons (p), and electrons (e), the departure from chemical
equilibrium is quantified by the chemical potential difference $\delta\mu\equiv
\mu_{\rm p}+\mu_{\rm e} -\mu_{\rm n}$. A finite $\delta\mu$ increases the
reaction rates and the neutrino emissivity. If large enough ($|\delta\mu|\gta
5kT$), it reduces the net cooling rate because some of the stored chemical
energy is converted into thermal energy, and can even lead to net heating. A
simple model shows the effect of this heating mechanism on the thermal
evolution of neutron stars. It is particularly noticeable for old, rapidly
spinning stars with weak magnetic fields. Observational consequences for
millisecond pulsars are discussed.

Reconnection shocks in a magnetically dominated plasma must be compressive.
Non-thermal ion acceleration can occur across built-in slow shocks, and across
outflow fast shocks when the outflow is supermagnetosonic and the field is
line-tied. Electron acceleration may be initiated by injection from the
dissipation region. Reconnection and shock acceleration thus cooperate and
non-thermal acceleration should be a characteristic feature.

We examine the extent to which galactic and extragalactic foregrounds can
hamper the detection of primordial Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies. We limit our discussion to intermediate angular scales,
$10^{\prime}\lsim \theta \lsim 2^{\circ}$, since many current as well as future
experiments have been designed to map CMB anisotropies at these angular scales.
In fact, scales of $\gsim 10^{\prime}$ are of crucial importance to test both
the conditions in the early Universe and current theories of the gravitational
collapse.

We present initial results of an imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint
galaxies in fields of Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopic target QSOs. The
primary objectives of the survey are (a) to determine the incidence, extent,
and covering factor of extended gaseous envelopes of luminous galaxies and (b)
to determine the fraction of Lyman alpha absorption systems that arise in
luminous galaxies. The goal of the survey is to identify in each field under
consideration all objects with apparent r-band magnitudes satisfying r< 21.5
within angular distances to the QSOs satisfying theta < 1.3 arcmin. We find
that at z \apl 1 most luminous galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous
envelopes of approx 160 h^{-1} kpc radius and roughly unit covering factor and
that at z \apl 1 the fraction of Ly alpha absorption systems that arise in
luminous galaxies is at least 0.35 \pm 0.10 and is likely 0.65 \pm 0.18.

In the course of the comprehensive CFRS redshift survey to I = 22.5 with the
CFHT MOS/SIS spectrograph, we have observed ~25 field galaxies with z > 1.
However, it is clear that almost an equal number, predominantly red galaxies,
have likely been missed largely because of limitations in the observed
wavelength range. The properties of the observed galaxies and the reasons for
the presumed incompleteness are briefly discussed in this contribution, and
strategies for improving our methods of observing high redshift galaxies are
explored. In particular, it is demonstrated that sky subtraction to the
required limiting magnitude is possible even with very low spectral resolution,
and that new IR arrays and new optical designs for multi-object spectrographs
will allow us to easily reach field galaxies at z > 1.

Deep V and I CCD images with sub-arcsec spatial resolution are used to
investigate the stellar content of the central regions of the Local Group dwarf
elliptical galaxy NGC147. Red giant branch (RGB) stars are resolved over the
entire field, and the RGB-tip occurs at I ~ 20.5, suggesting that the distance
modulus is 24.3. A comparison with globular cluster sequences indicates that
the center of NGC147 is moderately metal-poor, with [Fe/H] ~ -1. This is not
significantly different from what was found in the outer regions of the galaxy
by Mould, Kristian & Da Costa (1983, ApJ, 270, 471). Moreover, the width of the
V-I color distribution at I = 21.0 indicates that a spread in metallicity is
present, with sigma[Fe/H] ~ +/- 0.3. There is no evidence of a component more
metal-poor than [Fe/H] ~ -1.3. A small population of moderately bright
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has also been detected, and the AGB-tip
occurs near M{bol} ~ -5.0, indicating that an intermediate-age population is
present. It is estimated that the intermediate-age population contributes ~
2-3% of the V light from NGC147.

The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE, Udalski et al.~1994a;
Paczy\'nski et al.~1994b -- these proceedings; and references therein) is an
extensive photometric search for the rare cases of gravitational microlensing
of Galactic bulge stars by foreground objects. It provides a huge data base
(Szyma\'nski \& Udalski 1993), from which color-magnitude diagrams have been
compiled (Udalski et al.~1993, 1994b). Here we discuss the use a of
well-defined population of bulge red clump stars to investigate the presence of
the bar in our Galaxy. The results of our earlier studies are described by
Stanek et al.~(1994).

Using a combination of numerical simulation and synthesized Hubble Space
Telescope Wide Field Camera 2 (HST WFC2) images, we follow the detectability of
morphological signatures of disk galaxy mergers at intermediate redshifts z=0.4
and z=1.0. Rapid evolution in the surface brightness of tidal tails makes their
use as an interaction signature limited; long tidal tails will only be
detectable relatively early in the encounter, before the galaxies actually
merge. Violent relaxation rapidly smooths isophotal irregularities after the
galaxies merge, leaving the very low surface brightness tidal debris
surrounding the remnant as the only sign of peculiarity after a few hundred
Myr. This debris becomes indistinguishable from the main body of the remnant
after 0.5 (z=1.0) to 1 (z=0.4) Gyr, leaving a morphologically normal elliptical
galaxy behind. Using WFC1, all signatures become undetectable almost
immediately once the galaxies merge, due to the aberrated PSF. We interpret
these results in light of recent HST programs investigating the nature of
starburst and E+A galaxies in moderate redshift clusters.

In this paper we present Complete Stellar models (CoStar) for massive stars,
which treat the stellar interior and atmosphere, including its wind. Particular
emphasis is given to Wolf-Rayet stars. We address the question of the effective
temperatures of WNE and WC stars. Our first results show a satisfactory
agreement between the CoStar models and the simple temperature correction
method applied by Schaller et al. (1992). An analyses of the subphotospheric
structure of the WR star models shows the importance of metal opacity. This may
be essential for understanding the driving mechanism of Wolf-Rayet winds.

The prospects for detection of gravitational waves from precessing pulsars
have been considered by constructing fully relativistic rotating neutron star
models and evaluating the expected wave amplitude $h$ from a galactic source.
For a "typical" neutron matter equation of state and observed rotation rates,
it is shown that moderate wobble angles may render an observable signal from a
nearby source once the present generation of interferometric antennas becomes
operative.

The possibility that classical gamma ray bursts (GRB) occasionally repeat
from the same locations on the sky provides a critical test of GRB models.
There is currently some controversy about whether there is evidence for burst
repetition in the BATSE data. We introduce a gamma ray burst ``pair matching"
statistic that can be used to search for a repeater signal in the BATSE data.
The pair matching statistic is built upon the reported position errors for each
burst and is more sensitive than previously used statistics at detecting faint
repeating bursts or multiple burst recurrences. It is also less likely to
produce (false) evidence of burst repetition due to correlations in the
positions that are inconsistent with repeating bursters. We find that the
excesses in ``matched" and ``antipodal" pairs seen with other statistics are
caused by an excess of pairs with a separation smaller than their error bars
would indicate. When we consider all separations consistent with the error
bars, no significant signal remains. We conclude that the publicly available
BATSE 1B and 2B data sets contain no evidence for repeating gamma ray bursters.

We examine stochastic temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background
radiation (CBR) arising via the Sachs-Wolfe effect from gravitational wave
perturbations produced in the early universe. We consider spatially flat,
perturbed FRW models that begin with an inflationary phase, followed by a mixed
phase containing both radiation and dust. The scale factor during the mixed
phase takes the form $a(\eta)=c_1\eta^2+c_2\eta+c_3$, where $c_i$ are
constants. During the mixed phase the universe smoothly transforms from being
radiation to dust dominated. We find analytic expressions for the graviton mode
function during the mixed phase in terms of spheroidal wave functions. This
mode function is used to find an analytic expression for the multipole moments
$\langle a_l^2\rangle$ of the two-point angular correlation function
$C(\gamma)$ for the CBR anisotropy. The analytic expression for the multipole
moments is written in terms of two integrals, which are evaluated numerically.
The results are compared to multipoles calculated for models that are {\it
completely} dust dominated at last-scattering. We find that the multipoles
$\langle a_l^2\rangle$ of the CBR temperature perturbations for $l>10$ are
significantly larger for a universe that contains both radiation and dust at
last-scattering. We compare our results with recent, similar numerical work and
find good agreement. The spheroidal wave functions may have applications to
other problems of cosmological interest.

We discuss broad- and narrow-band imaging of 7 arcmin fields of 14 QSOs with
redshift ~1.1. The narrow-band filters were chosen to detect redshifted [O II]
3727A, and the broad bands are R and I, which correspond to rest wavelengths
{}~3300A and ~3800A. In 100 arcsec subfields surrounding the QSOs, we detect an
excess of typically 15 detected objects over the background of 25. Several of
the QSO subfields also contain an excess of blue (R-I < 1.0) galaxies compared
with the other subfields. Finally, several of the QSO subfields contain an
excess of galaxies with significant narrow-band flux compared with the other
subfields, and many of these are also blue. Most of the QSOs are radio-quiet in
a region of sky overpopulated with z=1.1 QSOs, and 3 others are radio-loud from
other parts of the sky. We suggest that most of these z=1.1 QSOs are in compact
groups of starbursting galaxies. In our data, there is no significant
difference between radio-loud and radio-quiet QSOs. We discuss cosmic
evolutionary implications.

We show that the statistical error, $\sigma_{\tau}$, in estimating the
optical depth, $\tau$, due to microlensing is substantially higher than the
naive Poisson estimate: $\sigma_{\tau} = \sqrt{\eta / N} \tau$, where $N$ is
the number of detections and $1.65 \leq \eta \lsim 3$. We construct a
``microlensing map'' using an observationally well-constrained barred bulge
model and compare this with a map based on a spherical bulge model. The result
indicates a significant differences in the distribution of optical depths. If
the optical depths are determined over a wide range of positions around the
Galactic center, one could make a rudimentary determination of the geometry of
the mass distribution of the Galactic bulge by observing $\sim 200$ events.
About 800 events are required to determine the relative contributions to the
event rate by bulge and disk Machos.

We study thermoreactive and acoustic instabilities in a diffuse gas,
photoionized and heated by a radiation field. The analysis of the thermal
instability by Field (1965) is extended to include the effects of the hydrogen
recombination reaction, which, in general, is found to be a stabilizing agent
for the condensation mode. This effect is stronger when the mean photon energy
is not much larger than the hydrogen ionization energy. In addition, there are
thermoreactive unstable equilibria for which an isobaric transition to a stable
phase is not possible and the system evolves toward a dynamic state
characterized by large amplitude, nonlinear periodic oscillations of
temperature, density and hydrogen ionization fraction. Acoustic waves are found
to be unstable for some temperatures of both the cold and the warm phase of the
ISM, also in regions where the gas is {\it thermally stable}, independently of
the mean photon energy.

We present an empirical method which uses visual band light curve shapes
(LCS) to estimate the luminosity of type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). This method is
first applied to a ``training set'' of 8 SN Ia light curves with independent
distance estimates to derive the correlation between the LCS and the
luminosity. We employ a linear estimation algorithm of the type developed by
Rybicki and Press (1992). The result is similar to that obtained by Hamuy et
al. (1995a) with the advantage that LCS produces quantitative error estimates
for the distance. We then examine the light curves for 13 SN Ia to determine
the LCS distances of these supernovae. The Hubble diagram constructed using
these LCS distances has a remarkably small dispersion of $\sigma_V$ = 0.21 mag.
We use the light curve of SN 1972E and the Cepheid distance to NGC 5253 to
derive $67 \pm 7 $ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the Hubble constant.

We discuss the observational status of the interstellar lithium isotopic
ratio and its significance with respect to the galactic evolution of lithium.

The key point limits to define the {\it statistical model} describing the
data distribution. Hence, it turns out that the characteristics related to the
so-called. Inverse Tully-Fisher relation and the Direct relation are maximum
likelyhood (ML) estimators of different statistical models, and we obtain
coherent distance estimates as long as the same model is used for the
calibration of the TF relation and for the determination of distances. The
choice of the model is motivated by reasons of {\it robustness} of statistics,
which depends on selection effects in observation.

The status of numerical hydrodynamical models for Planetary Nebulae is
reviewed. Since all of the numerical work is based on the interacting winds
model, we start with a description of this model and give an overview of the
early analytical and numerical models. Subsequently we address the numerical
models which include radiation effects, first of all the ones which neglect any
effects of stellar evolution. These `constant environment' models are shown to
closely match typical observed nebulae, both in images and kinematic data. This
shows that the basic generalized interacting winds model gives a good
description of the situation in aspherical PNe. Next we discuss models that do
include the effects of stellar and fast wind evolution. This introduces several
new effects, the most important of which are the formation of a surrounding
attached envelope, and the modification of the expansion of the nebula, which
helps in creating aspherical PNe very early on in their evolution. The
ionization of the slow wind also leads to a gradual smoothing out of its
aspherical character, working against aspherical PNe forming in later stages.
Finally we discuss some applications of the model to nebular problems.

We consider the galactic evolutionary history of \he3 in models which deplete
deuterium by as much as a factor of 2 to $\sim$ 15 from its primordial value to
its present day observed value in the ISM. We show that when \he3 production in
low mass stars (1 -- 3 $M_\odot$) is included over the history of the galaxy,
\he3 is greatly over-produced and exceeds the inferred solar values and the
abundances determined in galactic \hii regions. Furthermore, the ISM abundances
show a disturbing dispersion which is difficult to understand from the point of
view of standard chemical evolution models. In principle, resolution of the
problem may lie in either 1) the calculated \he3 production in low mass stars;
2) the observations of the \he3 abundance; or 3) an observational bias towards
regions of depleted \he3. Since \he3 observations in planetary nebula support
the calculated \he3 production in low mass stars, option (1) is unlikely. We
will argue for option (3) since the \he3 interstellar observations are indeed
made in regions dominated by massive stars in which \he3 is destroyed. In
conclusion, we note that the problem with \he3 seems to be galactic and not
cosmological.

We calculate the linear evolution for a class of mixed dark matter models,
where the hot component derives from the decay of a heavier particle (CntHDM
models). These models differ from ordinary mixed models based on massive
neutrinos (CHDM models), for which the hot component has a phase space
distribution which derives from a thermal one. In CntHDM models the density of
the hot component and the derelativisation redshift of its quanta are
indipendent parameters.
  In this work we provide the spectra for a number of CntHDM models, and
compare them with CDM and CHDM spectra.
  If PQ symmetry and SUSY simultaneously hold, the lightest standard neutralino
can be expected to decay into axino and photon.
  We briefly summarise the features of this particle model which gives rise to
the cosmological framework discussed here, as a fairly generic consequence.
Other frameworks which lead to similar models are also briefly discussed.

The early, hot, dense, expanding Universe was a primordial reactor in which
the light nuclides D, 3He, 4He and 7Li were synthesized in astrophysically
interesting abundances. The challenge to the standard hot big bang model (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis = BBN) is the comparison between the observed and
predicted abundances, the latter which depend only on the universal abundance
of nucleons. The current status of observations is reviewed and the inferred
primordial abundances are used to confront BBN. This comparison suggests
consistency for BBN for a narrow range in the nucleon abundance but, looming on
the horizon are some potential crises which will be outlined.

The distributions of peculiar velocities of rich clusters and of groups of
galaxies are investigated for different cosmological models and are compared
with observations. Four cosmological models are studied: standard ($\Omega=1$)
CDM, low-density ($\Omega=0.3$) CDM, HDM ($\Omega=1$), and PBI ($\Omega=0.3$),
all COBE normalized. We find that rich clusters of galaxies exhibit a
Maxwellian distribution of peculiar velocities in all models,as expected from a
Gaussian initial density field. The cluster 3-D velocity distribution typically
peaks at $v \sim 600$ km s$^{-1}$, and extends to high cluster velocities of $v
\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. The low-density CDM model exhibits somewhat lower
velocities: it peaks at $\sim 400$ km s$^{-1}$, and extends to $\sim 1200$ km
s$^{-1}$. Approximately 10\% ($\sim$1\% for low- density CDM) of all model rich
clusters move with high peculiar velocities of $v \ge 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. The
highest velocity clusters frequently originate in dense superclusters. The
model velocity distributions of groups and clusters of galaxies are compared
with observations. The data exhibit a larger high-velocity tail, to $v_r \geq
2000$ km s$^{-1}$, than seen in the model simulations (except HDM). Due to the
large observational uncertainties, however, the data are consistent at a $\sim
1$ to $3\sigma$ level with the model predictions and with a Gaussian initial
density field. Accurate observations of cluster peculiar velocities, especially
at the high-velocity tail, should provide powerful constraints on the
cosmological models.

The low accretion rate inferred for the GC source Sgr A* requires a distinct
type of accretion disk -- a starving disk. We investigate the structure of this
type of disk within the framework of thin Keplerian disk models taking into
account relativistic effects, detailed opacitiy tables and turbulent heat
transport. It appears as if starving disks are the perfect realization of
geometrically thin, optically thick disks with well behaved structure
functions. All in all starving disks are very stable structures with high
surface density, high optical depth and long viscous time scales. However,
S-curves in the Sigma-Mdot diagram occur, indicating a thermal limit-cycle
behaviour observable in the IR-NIR with timescales ranging between three years
and some thousand years. We propose that in Sgr A*, the main mass supply for
the disk might be a wind from the surrounding star cluster. As the disk is a
very stable and slowly evolving structure, it will inhibit spherical accretion
and incorporate the inflowing matter in the general accretion flow. The
situation in M31 may be very similar but with a more extreme set of parameters.

We try here to find new constraints on thick disk population using samples at
intermediate latitude and North Galactic Pole, which include photometry and
proper motions. The algorithm SEM (Stochastic-Estimation-Maximization; Celeux
\& Deibolt 1986) was used to deconvolve the stellar components up to large
distances above the plane, allowing to study of their statistical properties
independently. The multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) is used to qualify
the thick disk using observations in multidimensional space (V,B-V,U-B,
$\mu_{l}$ \& $\mu_{b}$).

Terrestrial and ``Heavenly'' experiments severely constrain the mass and
lifetime of an MeV tau neutrino. Irrespective of decay mode, for $\tau_\nu \ga
300\sec$ the mass of the tau neutrino must be either approximately $30\MeV$ or
less than $0.4\MeV$ (Majorana), $15\keV$ (Dirac). If the dominant decay mode
includes electromagnetic daughter products, the mass must be less than
$0.4\MeV$ (Majorana or Dirac) provided $\tau_\nu \ga 2.5\times 10^{-12}\sec$,
$15\keV$ (Dirac) provided $\tau_\nu \ga 10^{-6}\sec (m_\nu /\MeV )$. A tau
neutrino of mass between $1\MeV$ and $30\MeV$ can have a host of interesting
astrophysical and cosmological consequences: relaxing the big-bang
nucleosynthesis bound to the baryon density and the number of neutrino species,
allowing big-bang nucleosynthesis to accommodate a low (less than 22\%) $^4$He
mass fraction or high (greater than $10^{-4}$) deuterium abundance, improving
significantly the agreement between the cold dark matter theory of structure
formation and observations, and helping to explain how type II supernovae
explode. Exploring the MeV mass range not only probes fundamental particle
physics, but also interesting astrophysical and cosmological scenarios.

We compute the power spectrum of galaxy density fluctuations in a recently
completed redshift survey of optically-selected galaxies in the southern
hemisphere (SSRS2). The amplitude and shape of the SSRS2 power spectrum are
consistent with results of the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey of the
northern hemisphere (CfA2), including the abrupt change of slope on a scale of
30-50Mpc/h; these results are reproducible for independent volumes of space and
variations are consistent with the errors estimated from mock surveys. Taken
together, the SSRS2 and CfA2 form a complete sample of 14,383 galaxies which
covers one-third of the sky. The power spectrum of this larger sample continues
to rise on scales up to ~ 200Mpc/h, with weak evidence for flattening on the
largest scales. The SSRS2+CfA2 power spectrum and the power spectrum
constraints implied by COBE are well-matched by an Omega*h ~ 0.2,
Omega+lambda_0=1 CDM model with minimal biasing of optically-selected galaxies.

We report the detection of a 51-joule (320 +/- 90 EeV) cosmic ray by the
Fly's Eye air shower detector in Utah. This is substantially greater than the
energy of any previously reported cosmic ray. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff
of the energy spectrum (due to pion photoproduction energy losses) should occur
below this energy unless the highest energy cosmic rays have traveled less than
about 30 Mpc. The error box for the arrival direction in galactic coordinates
is centered on b=9.6 deg, l=163.4 deg. The particle cascade reached a maximum
size near a depth of 815 g/cm^2 in the atmosphere, a depth which does not
uniquely identify the type of primary particle.

The power spectrum of density fluctuations measured from galaxy redshift
surveys provides important constraints on models for the formation of
large-scale structure. I present new results for a redshift sample of 15,000
galaxies, and review the limitations of current measurements. To span the
decade of wavelength between the scales probed by galaxy surveys and COBE,
measure the detailed shape of the power spectrum, and accurately examine the
dependence of clustering on galaxy species, we require deeper samples with
carefully controlled selection criteria and improved techniques for power
spectrum estimation. I review plans for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and
describe a new method for estimating the power spectrum that optimally treats
survey data with arbitrary geometry and sampling.

The 320 EeV air shower detected by the Fly's Eye poses an important problem.
Careful analysis of pathlength limitations for the possible particle types due
to cosmic background radiation verifies that the particle very likely traveled
less than 50 Mpc from its source. The best candidates for accelerating
particles to such high energies are the very powerful radiogalaxies, however
they are all more than 100 Mpc distant. Our search finds no likely source
within 50 Mpc in the direction from which the particle arrived. This prompts
consideration of less likely astrophysical sources, like M82, as well as
non-standard mechanisms like cosmic string annihilation. It is also conceivable
that the air shower was produced by some non-standard particle whose pathlength
is unlimited because it does not interact with the cosmic background radiation.
A less radical alternative is that relatively strong magnetic fields deflected
the particle's path through a large angle, so it could have originated at a
nearby radiogalaxy at an earlier time of strong activity.

The Quasi-Steady-State Cosmology as proposed by Hoyle, Burbidge and Narlikar
does not fit the observed facts of the Universe. In particular, it predicts
that 75-90\% of the radio sources in the brightest sample that shows steeper
than Euclidean source counts should be blueshifted.

We present the first detailed spectroscopic study of field galaxies up to
z=0.3 from the I-magnitude limited CFRS sample. In this complete sample, we
find that about half of the objects are blue emission-line galaxies. Using line
ratio diagram and photoionization models, we show that in roughly half of these
emission-line galaxies, ionization by hot stars cannot account for the observed
line ratios. Their spectra have properties intermediate between Seyfert 2
galaxies and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). Their
number density (about 20%) relative to the total number of galaxies up to
z=0.3, is much larger than the number density (2%) of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) in the local Universe. Thus, the observed excess of blue galaxies in
counts down to B=24 cannot be mainly due to starburst galaxies, as was
previously thought. This result can shed a new light on the nature of the
overabundant population of blue galaxies at low redshifts.

This paper reviews some of the recent observational results on stellar mass
black hole candidates. Over the last decade, much of the progress in this field
has been achieved through the study of transient X--ray binary sources which
shine only sporadically in the X--ray sky and undergo much larger luminosity
variations then most persistent sources. There are currently six stellar--mass
black hole candidates for which the mass of the compact object is estimated to
be well above the maximum neutron star mass. The three most recently identified
black hole candidates of this kind belong to a class of transient X--ray
sources with peculiar spectral properties. Several new transients of this class
are being discovered and studied every year thanks to more continous monitoring
of the X--ray sky. Many of them are likely to contain other black hole
candidates. The growing number of candidates and the large luminosity
variations (and therefore, accretion rate variations) in transient sources will
allow to study the chacteristics of accreting black holes with an unprecedented
detail.

We present observations of Ti~II~$\lambda 3384$ absorption towards 15 distant
stars in the Galactic halo and the Magellanic Clouds. These new data extend
existing surveys of the distribution of Ti$^+$ to larger distances from the
plane of the Galaxy than sampled previously, allowing the scale height of
titanium to be determined for the first time. We find $h_{Ti^+} = 1.5 \pm
0.2$~kpc, a value which although greater than those of other tracers of neutral
gas, is not as large as had been suspected. We interpret the extended
distribution of Ti$^+$ as an indication that its severe depletion in
interstellar clouds in the disk is reduced at the lower densities prevailing in
the halo. The data are consistent with a simple power-law dependence of the Ti
abundance on the ambient density, with exponent $k \simeq -1$. If the model is
correct, it implies that refractory elements like Ti are fully returned to the
gas phase at distances beyond $\sim 1$ kpc from the plane of the Galaxy.

We present spectroscopic observations of supernova 1994D in NGC 4526, an
S0$_3$ galaxy in the Virgo cluster 15 Mpc distant. The datasets consist of the
interstellar Ca\II\ and Na\I\ lines towards the supernova at high spectral
resolution (FWHM 6 \kms), \halpha\ and [N\,II] observations at lower resolution
(FWHM 33 \kms) of the nucleus of NGC 4526 and the supernova, obtained with the
WHT at La Palma, and 21 cm spectra obtained with the 100 m Effelsberg
Radiotelescope in the field of NGC 4526.
  The velocity of the gas in NGC 4526 determined from our \halpha\ spectra is
+625 \kms\ at the centre and +880 \kms\ at the supernova position. Our value of
the systemic velocity is higher than the previous value of +450 \kms.
  In our high resolution spectra we detect Ca\II\ and Na\I\ absorption at +714
\kms\ which is produced in interstellar gas in NGC 4526. To our knowledge this
is the first detection of interstellar absorption originating in a galaxy of
early morphological type. We detect multi-component
  Ca\II\ and Na\I\ absorption lines in the range from +204 to +254 \kms\ which
originate in a complex of High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) located at a distance
$\ll$ 1 Mpc, in the surroundings of the Milky Way. The gas appears to have near
solar abundances, low dust content, and a diluted UV radiation field. At $-$29
\kms, we find weak Ca\II\ absorption and weak H\I\ emission. This component may
originate in gas infalling onto the Galactic disk. Finally, close to rest
velocity, we find both warm and cold gas located beyond 65 pc, probably
associated with high latitude gas at the border of Loop I. The total reddening
of the supernova, estimated using the standard Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio, is
$E$(B$-$V) $\simeq$ 0.05.

It is shown in this paper that deviations of galaxy cluster lenses from
spherical symmetry can render mass estimates for galaxy clusters based on the
formation of large arcs systematically to high. Numerical models show that the
mass needed for producing large arcs in clusters can be notably smaller than
expected from simple spherically symmetric lens models. The reason is that the
enhanced tidal effect in asymmetric and substructured lenses can compensate for
part of the convergence necessary for strong lensing effects. An analytic
argument is given to explain why deviations from radial symmetry will in
general decrease the required lens mass. Mass estimates assuming radially
symmetric lenses are on average too high by a factor of $\simeq1.6$, and with a
probability of $\simeq20\%$ by a factor of $\simeq2$.

We report on the first results obtained from a new optical identification
programme of 123 faint X-ray sources with $S$(0.5--2$\,{\rm keV)}>2\times
10^{-14}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}\,$cm$^{-2}\,$ serendipitously detected in {\it ROSAT}
PSPC pointed observations. We have spectroscopically identified the optical
counterparts to more than 100 sources in this survey. Although the majority of
the sample (68 objects) are QSOs, we have also identified 12 narrow emission
line galaxies which have extreme X-ray luminosities ($10^{42} < L_{\rm X} <
10^{43.5}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$). Subsequent spectroscopy reveals them to be a
mixture of starburst galaxies and Seyfert 2 galaxies in approximately equal
numbers. Combined with potentially similar objects identified in the {\it
Einstein} Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey, these X-ray-luminous galaxies
exhibit a rate of cosmological evolution, $L_{\rm X} \propto
(1+z)^{2.5\pm1.0}$, consistent with that derived for X-ray QSOs. This
evolution, coupled with the steep slope determined for the faint end of the
X-ray luminosity function ($\Phi(L_{\rm X}) \propto L_{\rm X}^{-1.9}$), implies
that such objects could comprise 15--35 per cent of the soft (1--2$\,$keV)

We report on a new estimate of the QSO X-ray luminosity function and its
evolution with redshift based on a sample of 107 QSOs detected at faint X-ray
fluxes, $S{\rm(0.5-2\,keV)}>4\times10^{-15}\,$\ergcms , with the {\it ROSAT}
X-ray satellite. For $q_0=0.5$, the X-ray evolution of QSOs in this sample is
consistent with strong luminosity evolution, $L_{\rm X} ^*(z) \propto
(1+z)^{3.25\pm0.1}$, at low redshifts ($z<1.60$) and a constant comoving space
density at higher redshifts. The derived rate of evolution at low redshifts is
thus significantly higher than that obtained previously for the {\it Einstein}
Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS). Indeed, most luminosity evolution
models provide a very poor fit (rejected at the 99 per cent confidence level)
when applied to the combined EMSS and {\it ROSAT} samples, although a
polynomial evolution model, $L_{\rm X} ^*(z) \propto 10^{(1.14\,z
-0.23\,z^2)}$, provides an adequate fit for $q_0=0$. For $q_0=0.5$, a simple
power-law luminosity evolution model with a redshift cut-off ($L_{\rm X} ^*(z)
\propto (1+z)^{2.51\pm0.1}$,

The role of momentum transfer (``radiation pressure'') due to an internal
source of ionizing radiation for the formation of baryonic structures is
investigated. Fully-ionized self-gravitating gaseous objects can be
radiation-pressure supported on a characteristic length scale $D_{\rm rp} \sim
100 \pc - 3 \kpc$. On smaller scales momentum transfer due to ionizing
radiation will be the dominant force and for spherical collapsing objects of
mass $\la 10^{10}\Msol$ a complete bounce is possible. A population of massive
stars and/or accretion onto a central compact object are natural sources of
ionizing radiation in newly-forming baryonic structures. Radiation pressure is
therefore likely to play an important role for the dynamical and thermal
evolution of the intergalactic medium and the mass-to-light ratio of small
galaxies. The effect will be especially important for hierarchical cosmogonies
where galactic structures build up by merging of smaller objects. Radiation
pressure due to ionizing radiation might furthermore be responsible for
substructures of size $D_{\rm rp}$ in the stellar component of large galaxies.

The formalism of Wiener filtering is developed here for the purpose of
reconstructing the large scale structure of the universe from noisy, sparse and
incomplete data. The method is based on a linear minimum variance solution,
given data and an assumed \prior model which specifies the covariance matrix of
the field to be reconstructed. While earlier applications of the Wiener filter
have focused on estimation, namely suppressing the noise in the measured
quantities, we extend the method here to perform both prediction and dynamical
reconstruction. The Wiener filter is used to predict the values of unmeasured
quantities, such as the density field in un-sampled regions of space, or to
deconvolve blurred data. The method is developed, within the context of linear
gravitational instability theory, to perform dynamical reconstruction of one
field which is dynamically related to some other observed field. This is the
case, for example, in the reconstruction of the real space galaxy distribution
from its redshift distribution When the field to be reconstructed is a Gaussian
random field, such as the primordial perturbation field predicted by the
canonical model of cosmology, the Wiener filter can be pushed to its fullest
potential. In such a case the Wiener estimator coincides with the Bayesian
estimator designed to maximize the {\it posterior} probability. The Wiener
filter can be also derived by assuming a quadratic regularization function, in
analogy with the `Maximum Entropy' method. The mean field obtained by the
minimal variance solution can be supplemented with constrained realizations of
the Gaussian field to

Anisotropies in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background have been
detected on a range of scales by several different experiments. These
anisotropies reflect the primordial spectrum of metric perturbations in the
early universe. In principle, the largest barrier to a clean interpretation of
the experimental results is contamination by foreground sources. We address
this issue by projecting out likely sources of foreground contamination {}from
seven separate small-angle and medium-angle experiments. We then calculate
likelihood functions for models with adiabatic perturbations, first for the
amplitude of the spectrum while constraining the spectral index to be $n=1$,
and then jointly for the amplitude and spectrum of the fluctuations. All of the
experiments are so far consistent with the simplest inflationary models; for
$n=1$ the experiments' combined best-fit quadrupole amplitude is $Q_{\rm
rms-ps}= 18^{+3}_{-1} \,\,\mu K$, in excellent agreement with the COBE two-year
data. In ($Q_{\rm rms-ps}$, n) space, the allowed region incorporating
intermediate and small-scale experiments is substantially more constrained than
{}from COBE alone. We briefly discuss the expected improvement in the data in
the near future and corresponding constraints on cosmological models.

We compare the observed colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and the main sequence
luminosity functions (LFs) of four Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) star clusters
namely, NGC 1711, NGC 2004, NGC 2164 and NGC 2214 with the synthetic ones
derived from the stellar evolutionary models. Four different types of stellar
evolutionary models have been used for comparison. The comparison of the
features of the observed CMDs with the synthetic ones favour the overshoot
models from Bressan et al. (1993). The synthetic integrated luminosity
functions from the models can be matched with the observed ones by varying the
value of mass function slopes. In order to constrain the models from the
comparison of the synthetic ILFs with the observed ones, reliable estimates of
mass function slope and binary fraction are desired.

An examination is made of the widely held belief that inflation is the only
possible causal mechanism capable of generating density perturbations on scales
well in excess of the Hubble radius. A simple proof is given, which relies only
on the assumption that our understanding of the universe from nucleosynthesis
onwards is correct. No assumption of the underlying gravitational theory is
necessary beyond that it is a metric theory.

This paper looks into various aspects brought to light by numerical work on
the generalized interacting winds model for planetary nebulae. First, a
detailed comparison between radiative and non-radiative models is made, showing
that one's naive expectations of the effects of radiative heating and cooling
are not always true. Secondly, we consider the evolution of the slow wind after
it has gotten ionized. It is found that the initial aspherical density
distribution is smoothed out after ionization, thus requiring the aspherical
nebula to be formed within the first few thousand years of PN evolution.
Thirdly, the nature of the flow in the hot bubble is investigated. Both one and
two-dimensional numerical models show strong signs of instabilities or
turbulent flow in the hot bubble. Although observationally hard to prove or
disprove this turbulent structure is critically examined. It is found that
although the turbulence is not a numerical artifact, the full three-dimensional
picture will most definitely differ from what is found in two dimensions. The
implications for the interpretation of the models are discussed. Finally, the
issue of the soft X-ray emission from PNe is considered. It is found that soft
X-rays originate mainly from the thin interface between the hot bubble and the
actual nebula.

In addition to their possible relevance to gamma-ray bursts, coalescing
binary neutron stars have long been recognized as important sources of
gravitational radiation that should become detectable with the new generation
of laser interferometers such as LIGO. Hydrodynamics plays an essential role
near the end of the coalescence when the two stars finally merge together into
a single object. The shape of the corresponding burst of gravitational waves
provides a direct probe into the interior structure of a neutron star and the
nuclear equation of state. The interpretation of the gravitational waveform
data will require detailed theoretical models of the complicated
three-dimensional hydrodynamic processes involved. Here we review the results
of our recent work on this problem, using both approximate quasi-analytic
methods and large-scale numerical hydrodynamics calculations on supercomputers.
We also discuss briefly the coalescence of white-dwarf binaries, which are also
associated with a variety of interesting astrophysical phenomena.

We present submm images of Sgr A* and its surroundings obtained at 800, 600
and 450 $\mu$m with the JCMT and derive flux densities of Sgr A* at all three
wave- lengths. Combined with upper limits by Gezari and associates at MIR
wavelengths a time averaged radio spectrum is obtained which increases $\propto
\nu^{1/3}$, attains a maximum at $\nu_max \ga 600 GHz$ and must decrease
rapidly at fre- quencies $\ga 10^4$GHz. This spectrum allows for about $3
M}_\odot$ of 50K dust and associated hydrogen in the telescope beam. While
variations on time-scales of a few months are now well established for the
frequency range $\nu \la 100 GHz$, our investigation of variability at higher
frequencies still yields only marginal results. The Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND)
extends over the central 12 pc. At the galactocentric radius $R \sim 1 pc$ dust
and hydrogen column densities drop to low values and form the Central Cavity.
Our submm images show that the bottom of this cavity is rather flat. Variations
in the dust emission are just consistent with the detection of a `Tongue' of
$\sim 200 M_\odot$ of atomic hydrogen reported by Jackson et al. (1993) to be
located between the Northern and the Eastern Arm of the Minispiral. We present
a revised submm/IR spectrum of the central $30\arcsec$ (R$\la 0.6 pc$) with
flux densities corrected for an interstellar extinction of $A_v \sim 31 mag$.
This spectrum attains its maximum at $\lambda \sim 20 \mu m$ and comes from
dust with temperatures $\sim 170 - 400 K$ which is associated with the Eastern
Arm and the East-West Bar. The in- tegrated luminosity is $\sim 5 10^6 L_\odot$
to which emission at $\lambda \la 30 \mu m$ contributes $\sim 80\%$. Heating of
this dust is not provided by a central source but rather by a cluster of hot
($T eff \sim 3 - 3.5 10^4 K$) and luminous stars which could include the He{\sc
i}/H{\sc i}-stars detected by

The Vilnius Photometric system has been used with a CCD system only once
before this study. Preliminary crowded field reductions of Vilnius CCD
observations of the star clusters NGC~2004 and NGC~4755 (the $\kappa $ Crucis
cluster) are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of using the filter set
in this manner.

We use a Maximum Entropy technique to reconstruct a map of the microwave sky
near the star Gamma Ursae Minoris, based on data from flights 2, 3 and 4 of the
Millimeter-wave Anisotropy eXperiment (MAX).

This paper discusses the ability of Li to confirm the substellar nature of a
brown dwarf candidate. Theoretical computations using different interior models
agree that brown dwarfs with masses below $\sim$ 0.065 M$_{\odot}$ preserve a
significant fraction of their initial Li content while for higher masses total
Li depletion occurs in very short timescales. Refined spectral synthesis using
brown dwarf model atmospheres shows that the Li I resonance line at 670.8 nm
should produce a conspicuous feature at effective temperatures higher than 2000
K, suitable for spectroscopic detection in present brown dwarf candidates. We
summarize the results of our search for Li in many of the best candidates known
so far.

We present a high-resolution image of $\eta$~Car. Together with IR and visual
observations of the central arcsecond, we use this to discuss the morphological
structure of $\eta$~Car on the different length scales. We identify three
different structural components: a bipolar outflow, an equatorial disk of
streamers, and the speckle objects. We discuss models for the kinematics of the
whole complex, and propose observations that could settle the question of the
structure of $\eta$~Car.

A catalogue of binary galaxies with 621 pairs has been determined by applying
a surface density enhancement procedure to {\it The Surface Photometry
Catalogue of the ESO-Uppsala Galaxies}. The method does not require any
redshift information. An additional restriction, based on objective criteria
that take into account the completeness of the source catalogue, led to a
sample of 189 isolated pairs which are listed. We have obtained the optical
luminosity function of binary galaxies in the catalogue, from which we estimate
that the luminosity density of galaxies in binaries is $\sim$4% of that found
for field galaxies. The general properties of our sample are similar to those
from CPG and CMG.

We study the effect of the dynamical friction induced by the presence of
substructure on the statistics of the collapse of density peaks. Applying the
results of a former paper we show that within high density environments, like
rich clusters of galaxies, the collapse of smaller peaks is strongly delayed
until very late epochs. A bias of dynamical nature thus naturally arises
because high density peaks preferentially collapse For a standard CDM model we
find that this dynamical bias can account for a substantial part of the total
bias required by observations on cluster scales.

We present techniques for identifying and analyzing galaxy groups and show
that they provide a powerful discriminator between cosmological models. We
apply these to high-resolution PM N-body simulations of structure formation in
CHDM (cold/hot/baryon fractions=.6/.3/.1, b=1.5 (COBE norm) and two CDM models;
b=1.5 and b=1.0 (COBE norm). Groups are identified with the Nolthenius (1993)
algorithm. We find: (1) Properties of groups are a powerful and robust
discriminator between these Gaussian models whose spatial and velocity
properties differ on Mpc scales. We test robustness against several methods for
assigning luminosity to dark matter halos, for merging CfA1 galaxies, and for
breaking up massive over-mergers (2) When allowance is made for the high large
scale power P(k) present in the CfA1 data, CHDM at our $\Omnu=0.30$ produces
slightly too many groups and groups too high a fraction of the galaxies, while
the fraction grouped in CDM is far too low. Lowering $\Omnu$ would appear to
produce close agreement with all measures, save one: for all simulations,
median group sizes are x1.4-1.7 larger than equivalently selected CfA1 groups.
(3) The standard group M/L method gives $\Omega\simeq 0.1$ for CHDM and CfA1,
and $\Omega\simeq 0.35$ for CDM. A conspiracy of three effects produce these
very low values, and we conclude that low observed $\Omega$'s need not argue
for a low $\Omega$ universe. When overmergers are broken up, the median virial-
to-DM mass of 3D selected groups is $\sim1$ for all simulations.
$M_{DM}>10^{14}\Msun$ groups appear virialized in all simulations. Global
velocity biases $b_v$ are similar to previous studies. Within 3D-selected
groups, CHDM and CDM b=1.5 show a stronger bias of $b_v=0.7-0.8$, while CDM
b=1.0 shows group $b_v$'s $\simeq 1$.

We study the rate of escape of stars (``evaporation'') from tidally-limited
postcollapse globular clusters having a power-law distribution of stellar
masses. We use a multi-mass Fokker-Planck code and assume a steady tidal field.
Stellar-dynamical processes cause the inner parts of the cluster to expand,
which in turn causes stars to overflow the tidal boundary. Mass loss by stellar
evolution is assumed to be unimportant in these later evolutionary stages. The
fraction of the cluster mass lost per half-mass relaxation time ($\trh$) is
roughly constant, in agreement with simple homologous models with equal-mass
stars. If $\trh$ is computed in the conventional way from the mean stellar
mass, however, a broad stellar mass function can double the loss of mass per
$\trh$. We discuss implications of our results for the evolution of
globular-cluster systems in our own and other galaxies. In particular, the
number of Galactic clusters destroyed by evaporation alone may be as large or
larger than the present cluster population.

Much interest has been generated recently by the ongoing MACHO, EROS and OGLE
projects to identify gravitationally lensed stars from the Large Magellanic
Cloud and Galactic bulge, and the positive identification of several events
(Alcock et al, (1993), Aubourg et al, (1993) and Udalski et al, (1993)). The
rate at which such events are found should provide considerable information
about the distribution of the low mass compact objects, brown dwarfs etc.
responsible for the lensing, and their relative importance as a component of
the cosmological `dark matter'. We show measurement of the polarisation of
starlight during these events can yield considerably more information about the
lensing objects than was previously considered possible. Furthermore, the
consideration of extended sources is shown to have a significant effect on the
interpretation of the profiles and statistics of the events.

An adaptation of the Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh (P3M) code to the
special purpose hardware GRAPE is presented. The short range force is
calculated by a four chip GRAPE-3A board, while the rest of the calculation is
performed on a Sun Sparc 10/51 workstation. The limited precision of the GRAPE
hardware and algorithm constraints introduce stochastic errors of the order of
a few percent in the gravitational forces. Tests of this new P3MG3A code show
that it is a robust tool for cosmological simulations. The code currently
achieves a peak efficiency of one third the speed of the vectorized P3M code on
a Cray C-90 and significant improvements are planned in the near future.
Special purpose computers like GRAPE are therefore an attractive alternative to
supercomputers for numerical cosmology.

Peebles has suggested an interesting method to trace back in time positions
of galaxies called the least action method. This method applied on the Local
Group galaxies seems to indicate that we live in an $\Omega\approx 0.1$
Universe. We have studied a CDM N-body simulation with $\Omega=0.2$ and $H=50
kms^{-1}/Mpc$ and compare trajectories traced back from the Least Action
Principle and the center of mass of the particle forming CDM halos. We show
that the agreement between these set of trajectories is at best qualitative. We
also show that the line of sight peculiar velocities are underestimated. This
discrepancy is due to orphans, CDM particles which do not end up in halos. By
varying the density parameter $\Omega$ in the least action principle we show
that using this method we would underestimate the density of the Universe by a
factor of 4-5.

Using the output from a grid of 60 Type II supernova models (Woosley \&
Weaver 1994) of varying mass (11 $\ltaprx$ M/M\sun $\ltaprx$ 40) and
metallicity (0, 10$^{-4}$, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 Z\sol), the chemical evolution of
76 stable isotopes, from hydrogen to zinc, is calculated. The chemical
evolution calculation employs a simple dynamical model for the Galaxy (infall
with a 4 billion year $e$-folding time scale onto a exponential disk and
1/r$^2$ bulge), and standard evolution parameters, such as a Salpeter initial
mass function and a quadratic Schmidt star formation rate. The theoretical
results are compared in detail with observed stellar abundances in stars with
metallicities in the range -3.0 $\ltaprx$ [Fe/H] $\ltaprx$ 0.0 dex. While our
discussion focuses on the solar neighborhood where there are the most
observations, the supernovae rates, an intrinsically Galactic quantity, are
also discussed.

The analysis of the first three years of the OGLE data revealed 12
microlensing events of the Galactic bulge stars, with the characteristic time
scales in the range $ 8.6 < t_0 < 80 $ days, where $ t_0 = R_E / V $. A
complete sample of nine events gave the optical depth to gravitational
microlensing larger than $(3.3 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-6}$, in excess of current
theoretical estimates, indicating a much higher efficiency for microlensing by
either bulge or disk lenses. The lenses are likely to be ordinary stars in the
Galactic bar, which has its long axis elongated towards us. At this time we
have no evidence that the OGLE events are related to dark matter. The OGLE
color magnitude diagrams reveal the presence of the Galactic bar and a low
density inner disk region $ \sim 4 $ kpc in radius. A catalogue of a few
thousand variable stars is in preparation.

We develop and test a method for measuring the gravitational lensing induced
distortion of faint background galaxies. We first describe how we locate the
galaxies and measure a 2-component `polarisation' or ellipticity statistic
$e_\alpha$ whose expectation value should be proportional to the gravitational
shear $\gamma_\alpha$. We then show that an anisotropic instrumental psf
perturbs the polarisation by $\delta e_\alpha = P^s_{\alpha\beta} p_\beta$,
where $p_\alpha$ is a measure of the psf anisotropy and $P^s_{\alpha\beta}$ is
the `linearised smear polarisability tensor'. By estimating $P^s_{\alpha\beta}$
for each object we can determine $p_\alpha$ from the foreground stars and apply
a correction $-P^s_{\alpha\beta}p_\beta$ to the galaxies. We test this
procedure using deep high-resolution images from HST which are smeared with an
anisotropic psf and then have noise added to simulate ground-based
observations. We find that the procedure works very well. A similar analysis
yields a linear shear polarisability tensor $P^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}$ which
describes the response to a gravitational shear. This calibrates the
polarisation-shear relation, but only for galaxies which are well resolved. To
empirically calibrate the effect of seeing on the smaller galaxies we
artificially stretch HST images to simulate lensing and then degrade them as
before. These experiments provide a rigorous and exacting test of the method
under realistic conditions. They show that it is possible to remove the effect
of instrumental psf anisotropy, and that the method provides an efficient and
quantitative measurement of the gravitational shear.

We report the discovery of a z=2.76 radio galaxy, MG1019+0535, with an
unusual spectrum. Ly$\alpha$, which usually dominates the spectra of high
redshift radio galaxies, is very weak and the strongest lines in the spectrum
are CIV$\lambda$1549 and HeII$\lambda$1640. We speculate that dust is
responsible for attenuating the Ly$\alpha$ line. This object provides more
evidence for dust formation at early epochs. The optical counterpart of the
compact radio source has a double morphology which is orthogonal to the radio
source axis and most likely due to the superposition of two distinct objects
which may or may not be physically related. There is only one detected line
from the brighter component (B) which is close in observed wavelength to the
redshifted HeII$\lambda$1640 line from the z=2.76 galaxy (A). We discuss
whether B is at the same redshift as A or whether it is a foreground galaxy at
z=0.66. We also report the serendipitous discovery of a very red ($R-K>7$)
field object.

We report on Keck observations and confirm the redshift of the most distant
galaxy known: 8C1435+63 at z=4.25. The spectrum shows a strong Ly$\alpha$ line,
a Ly$\alpha$ forest continuum break and a continuum break at
$\lambda_{rest}=912$\AA. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is spatially extended and
roughly aligned with the radio source. The galaxy shows a double structure in
the $I$-band ($\lambda_{rest}\approx$1500\AA) which is aligned with the radio
axis; the two $I$-band components spatially coincide with the nuclear and
southern radio components. Some fraction of the $I$ band emission could be due
to a nonthermal process such as inverse compton scattering. In the $K$-band
($\lambda_{rest}\approx$4200\AA), which may be dominated by starlight, the
galaxy has a very low surface brightness, diffuse morphology. The $K$
morphology shows little relationship to the radio source structure, although
the major axis of the $K$ emission is elongated roughly in the direction of the
radio source axis. The galaxian continuum is very red ($I-K>4$) and if the $K$
continuum is due to starlight, implies a formation redshift of $z_f > 5$. We
speculate that this galaxy may be the progenitor of a present day cD galaxy.

Working toward a model independent understanding of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropies and their significance, we undertake a
comprehensive and self-contained study of scalar perturbation theory. Initial
conditions, evolution, thermal history, matter content, background dynamics,
and geometry all play a role in determining the anisotropy. By employing {\it
analytic} techniques to illuminate the numerical results, we are able to
separate and identify each contribution. We thus bring out the nature of the
{\it total} Sachs-Wolfe effect, acoustic oscillations, diffusion damping,
Doppler shifts, and reionization, as well as their particular manifestation in
a critical, curvature, or cosmological constant dominated universe. By studying
the full angular {\it and} spatial content of the resultant anisotropies, we
isolate the signature of these effects from the dependence on initial
conditions. Whereas structure in the Sachs-Wolfe anisotropy depends strongly on
the underlying power spectra, the acoustic oscillations provide features which
are nearly model independent. This may allow for future determination of the
matter content of the universe as well as the adiabatic and/or isocurvature
nature of the initial fluctuations.

I discuss how spectroscopy of extragalactic globular clusters provides a
powerful probe of the formation history and mass distribution of galaxies. One
critical area is spectroscopy of objects which have been identified as
candidate young globular clusters through HST imaging of galaxy mergers. I
discuss how such data can constrain models of globular cluster and galaxy
formation. As an example, I present new spectra which confirm the presence of
young globular clusters in NGC 1275. A second way wide-field spectroscopy can
be used to probe the formation history and mass distribution of galaxies is
through spectroscopy of large numbers of globular clusters around elliptical
galaxies. Metallicities obtained from such data place strong constraints on
models of galaxy formation, and velocities determined from the same data
provide kinematical tracers of the mass distribution out to distances of $\sim
100$ kpc.

We discuss gravitational effects of global scalar fields and, especially, of
global topological defects. We first give an introduction to the dynamics of
global fields and the formation of defects. Next we investigate the induced
gravitational fields, first in a flat background and then in the expanding
universe. In flat space, we explicitly calculate the gravitational fields of
exact global monopole and global texture solutions and discuss the motion of
photons and massive particles in these geometries. We also show that slowly
moving particles and the energy of photons are not affected in static scalar
field configurations with vanishing potential energy. In expanding space, we
explore the possibility that global topological defects from a phase transition
in the very early universe may have seeded inhomogeneities in the energy
distribution which yielded the observed large scale structure in the Universe,
the sheets of galaxies, clusters, voids ... . We outline numerical simulations
which have been performed to tackle this problem and briefly discuss their
results.

We present FOS observations of O III] 1666 A and C III] 1909 A emission in H
II regions in dwarf irregular galaxies to measure C/O abundance ratios in those
galaxies. We observe a continuous increase in C/O with increasing O/H over the
range -4.7 < log(O/H) < -3.6. One interpretation is that the most metal-poor
galaxies are the youngest and dominated by the products of early enrichment by
massive stars, while more metal-rich galaxies show increasing, delayed
contributions of C from intermediate mass stars. However, recent evolution
models for massive stars including mass loss suggest that the yield of C
relative to O may increase with metallicity; new chemical evolution models for
the solar neighborhood which account for this predict a C/O abundance evolution
similar to that observed in the metal-poor galaxies. The C/N ratio increases
steadily with O/H in the irregular galaxies, but is much smaller in solar
neighborhood stars and H II regions. This may indicate that the bulk of N
production is decoupled from that of C in the Galaxy.

The globular clusters that we observe in galaxies may be only a fraction of
the initial population. Among the evolutionary influences on the population is
the destruction of globular clusters by tidal forces as the cluster moves
through the field of influence of a disk, a bulge, and/or a putative nuclear
component (black hole). We have conducted a series of N-body simulations of
globular clusters on bound and marginally bound orbits through potentials that
include black hole and spheroidal components. The degree of concentration of
the spheroidal component can have a considerable impact on the extent to which
a globular cluster is disrupted. If half the mass of a $10^{10} \msun$ spheroid
is concentrated within 800pc, then only black holes with masses $>10^9 \msun$
can have a significant tidal influence over that already exerted by the bulge.
However, if the matter in the spheroidal component is not so strongly
concentrated toward the center of the galaxy, a more modest central black hole
(down to $10^8 \msun$) could have a dominant influence on the globular cluster
distribution, particularly if many of the clusters were initially on highly
radial orbits. Our simulations show that the stars that are stripped from a
globular cluster follow orbits with roughly the same eccentricity as the
initial cluster orbit, spreading out along the orbit like a ``string of
pearls''. Since only clusters on close to radial orbits will suffer substantial
disruption, the population of stripped stars will be on orbits of high
eccentricity.

We apply a new statistics, the factorial moment correlators, to density maps
obtained from the APM survey. The resulting correlators are all proportional to
the two point correlation function, substantially amplified, with an
amplification nearly exponential with the total rank of the correlators. This
confirms the validity of the hierarchical clustering assumption on the dynamic
range examined, corresponding to $0.5 \hmpc - 50 \hmpc$ in three dimensional
space. The Kirkwood superposition with loop terms is strongly rejected. The
structure coefficients of the hierarchy are also fitted. The high quality of
the APM catalog enabled us to disentangle the various contributions from the
power spectrum, small scale nonlinear clustering, and combinatorial effects,
all of which affect the amplification of the correlators. These effects should
appear in correlations of clusters in a similar fashion.

We discuss the radio spectrum of Sgr A* \index{Sgr A*, radio spectrum} in the
frequency range between $\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$ and $\approx 1\,000\,{\rm GHz}$,
show that it can be explained by optically thin synchrotron radiation
\index{Sgr A*, synchrotron radiation, optically thin} of relativistic
electrons, and point toward a possible correlation between the spectrum of Sgr
A* and larger-scale ($\la 50\,{\rm pc}$) radio emission from the Galactic
Center \index{Galactic Center} region.

We have observed evidence for $p$-mode oscillations in the G0 IV star etaBoo
(V = 2.68). This represents the first clear evidence of solar-like oscillations
in a star other than the Sun. We used a new technique which measures
fluctuations in the temperature of the star via their effect on the equivalent
widths of the Balmer lines. The observations were obtained over six nights with
the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma and consist of 12684
low-dispersion spectra. In the power spectrum of the equivalent-width
measurements, we find an excess of power at frequencies around 850 microHz
(period 20 minutes) which consists of a regular series of peaks with a spacing
of $\Delta\nu=40.3$ microHz. We identify thirteen oscillation modes, with
frequency separations in agreement with theoretical expectations. Similar
observations of the daytime sky show the five-minute solar oscillations at the
expected frequencies.

We present a new approach to the statistics of the cosmic density field and
to the mass distribution of high-contrast structures, based on the formalism of
Cayley trees. Our approach includes in one random process both fluctuations and
interactions of the density perturbations. We connect tree-related quantities,
like the partition function or its generating function, to the mass
distribution. The Press \& Schechter mass function and the Smoluchowski kinetic
equation are naturally recovered as two limiting cases corresponding to
independent Gaussian fluctuations, and to aggregation of high-contrast
condensations, respectively. Numerical realizations of the complete random
process on the tree yield an excess of large-mass objects relative to the Press
\& Schechter function. When interactions are fully effective, a power-law
distribution with logarithmic slope -2 is generated.

The recent observations of microlensing events in the LMC by the MACHO and
EROS collaborations suggest that an important fraction of the galactic halo is
in the form of Massive Halo Objects (MHO) of about 0.1 M_{\odot}. Here, we
argue that the galactic halo is mainly baryonic and that besides MHO also H_2
molecular clouds may significantly contribute to it. We propose a scenario in
which dark clusters of MHO and/or H_2 molecular clouds form in the halo at
galactocentric distances larger than ~ 10-20 kpc, since there we expect less
collisions among proto globular cluster clouds and a smaller UV radiation flux.
Cosmic ray protons may induce a significant gamma-ray flux in H_2 molecular
clouds. Our calculation gives an upper bound to this flux which is below
present detectability.

The Einstein On-Line Service (EOLS) is a simple menu-driven system which
provides an intuitive method of querying over one hundred database catalogs. In
addition, the EOLS contains over 30 CDROMs of images from the Einstein X-ray
Observatory which are available for downloading. The EOLS provides all of our
databases to the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and our documents which
describe each table are written in the ADS format. In conjunction with the IAU
working group on Radioastronomical Databases, the EOLS serves as an
experimental platform for on-line access to radio source catalogs. The number
of entries in these catalogs exceeds half a million.

Local nonlinear approximations to the growth of cosmic perturbations are
developed, resulting in relations, at a given epoch, between the peculiar
velocity and gravity fields and their gradients. Only the equation of motion is
approximated, while mass conservation and the computation of the gravitational
field are treated exactly. The second-order relation is derived for arbitrary
geometry and cosmological parameters. Solutions are developed to fourth order
for laminar spherical perturbations in an Einstein-de Sitter universe, but the
gain in accuracy for higher orders is modest. All orders become comparable when
the peculiar kinetic energy per unit mass equals the peculiar potential,
typically at relative density perturbations, $\delta \sim 4$. The general
second-order relation, while implicit, is simple to solve. \nbody\ simulations
show that it provides moderate gains in accuracy over other local
approximations. It can therefore be easily applied in the comparison of
large-scale structures and velocities in the quasi-linear regime, $\delta \sim
1 - 4$, as well as in the reconstruction of the primordial perturbations from
which they grew.

Mass loss dominates the stellar evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch. The
phase of highest mass-loss occurs during the last 1--10\% of the AGB and
includes the so-called Miras and OH/IR stars. In this review I will discuss the
characteristics and evolution of especially Miras, and discuss how they are
linked to the mass loss. There are indications that high mass-loss rates are
only reached for relatively young stars with massive progenitors. The mass loss
rates vary both on long and short time scales: the short-term variations are
likely linked to luminosity variations associated with the thermal-pulse cycle.
The influence of mass loss in the post-AGB phase is also discussed.

A new grid of theoretical isochrones based on the Yale stellar evolution code
using the OPAL and Kurucz opacities has been constructed. The grid of
isochrones spans a wide range of metallicities, helium abundances and masses.
The construction of the isochrones is described and the isochrones are compared
to galactic globular cluster observations. A solar calibrated mixing length
($\alpha = 1.7$) yields a good fit to globular cluster colour-magnitude
diagrams. Ages for 40 globular clusters are determined using the \dv method and
the formation of the halo is discussed.

We have obtained new redshifts for 265 objects in the central
48~$\times$~25~arcmin$^2$ region of the Coma cluster. When supplemented with
literature data, our redshift sample is 95~\% complete up to a magnitude
b$_{26.5}$=18.0 (the magnitudes are taken from the photometric sample of Godwin
et al. 1983). Using redshift-confirmed membership for 205 galaxies, and the
location in the colour-magnitude diagram for another 91 galaxies, we have built
a sample of cluster members which is complete up to b$_{26.5}$=20.0. We show
that the Coma cluster luminosity function cannot be adequately fitted by a
single Schechter (1976) function, because of a dip in the magnitude
distribution at b$_{26.5}$$\sim$17. The superposition of an Erlang (or a Gauss)
and a Schechter function provides a significantly better fit. We compare the
luminosity function of Coma to those of other clusters, and of the field.
Luminosity functions for rich clusters look similar, with a maximum at $M_{b}
\simeq -19.5 + 5 \times \log h_{50}$, while the Virgo and the field luminosity
functions show a nearly monotonic behaviour. These differences may be produced
by physical processes related to the environment which affect the luminosities
of a certain class of cluster galaxies.

Current extragalactic databases are reviewed, including object-oriented
databases, astronomical catalogues and compilations, as well as image archives
and object catalogues from large-scale surveys. One challenge of the future
will be to maintain the accessibility of all published information on
individual objects; the other will be the cross-identification between various
ongoing and planned large-scale surveys, some of them resulting in several
hundred million objects each. Powerful user interfaces are being developed to
tackle these tasks.

From the literature of 1987 to 1993 a representative sample was prepared of
500 papers with tabular information for >~50 supposedly extragalactic objects
each. Regardless of their scientific value, but corrected for redundancy, these
papers contain 842,000 entries. For the 374 papers with >100 entries each, the
CDS FTP-archive of catalogues contains tables for 21 % of them, increasing from
11 % for 1987 to 29 % for 1993. The coverage in terms of entries is much
higher, and half of all papers with >1500 entries are in the archive. Valuable
and/or large data sets are identified among the missing ones. Some of these can
be found in other archives, and it is argued that tabular material published in
future should be preserved more systematically in a collaborative effort
between authors, journal editors and data centres.

The amount of data produced by large observational facilities and space
missions has led to the archiving and on-line accessibility of much of this
data, available to the entire astronomical community. This allows a much wider
multi-frequency approach to astronomical research than previously possible.
Here we provide an overview of these services, and give a basic description of
their contents and possibilities for accessing them. Apart from services
providing observational data, many of those providing general information, e.g.
on addresses, bibliographies, software etc. are also described. The field is
rapidly growing with improved network technology, and our attempt to keep the
report as complete and up-to-date as possible will inevitably be outdated
shortly. We will endeavor to maintain an updated version of this document
on-line.

Measurement of the gravitational distortion of images of distant galaxies is
rapidly becoming established as a powerful probe of the dark mass distribution
in clusters of galaxies. With the advent of large mosaics of CCD's these
methods should provide a composite total mass profile for galaxy haloes and
also measure the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on supercluster scales. We
describe how HST observations have been used to place the observational
measurement of the shear on a quantitative footing. By artifically stretching
and then degrading WFPC2 images to simulate ground based observing it is now
possible to directly calibrate the effect of atmospheric seeing. Similar
experiments show that one can remove the effect of artificial image anisotropy
arising in the atmosphere or telescope. There have also been important advances
in the interpretation of the shear: reconstruction techniques have been
extended to encompass the strong distortion regime of giant arcs etc., progress
has been made in removing a bias present in earlier reconstruction techniques,
and we describe new techniques for `aperture densitometry'. We present some new
results on clusters of galaxies, and discuss the intimate connections between
weak lensing and deep spectroscopy.

We present a study of the colors of globular clusters associated with the
elliptical galaxy NGC 3923. Our final sample consists of Washington system C
and T_1 photometry for 143 globular cluster candidates with an expected
contamination of no more than 10%. We find that the color distribution of the
NGC 3923 globular cluster system (GCS) is broad and appears to have at least
two peaks. A mixture modeling analysis of the color distribution indicates that
a two component model is favored over a single component one at a high level of
confidence (>99%). This evidence for more than one population in the GCS of NGC
3923 is similar to that previously noted for the four other elliptical galaxies
for which similar data have been published. Furthermore, we find that the NGC
3923 GCS is redder than the GCSs of previously studied elliptical galaxies of
similar luminosity. The median metallicity inferred from our (C-T_1)_0 colors
is [Fe/H]_{med} = -0.56, with an uncertainty of 0.14 dex arising from all
sources of uncertainty in the mean color. This is more metal rich than the
median metallicity found for the GCS of M87 using the same method, [Fe/H]_{med}
= -0.94. Since M87 is more luminous than NGC 3923, this result points to
significant scatter about any trend of higher GCS metallicity with increasing
galaxy luminosity. We also show that there is a color gradient in the NGC 3923
GCS corresponding to about -0.5 dex in Delta[Fe/H]\Delta(log r). We conclude
that the shape of the color distribution of individual GCSs and the variation
in mean color among the GCSs of ellipticals are difficult to understand if
elliptical galaxies are formed in a single protogalactic

We analyze previous results on the stability of uniformly and differentially
rotating, self-gravitating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric systems to derive
a new stability criterion for the appearance of toroidal, m=2 Intermediate (I)
and bar modes. In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar
systems and the m=2 I-modes in gaseous systems have many common physical
characteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy
of the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in
stellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability
criterion. The new stability parameter "alpha" is formulated first for
uniformly rotating systems and is based on the angular momentum content rather
than on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems
"alpha" = 0.254-0.258, while it is in the range of 0.341-0.354 for gaseous
systems. For uniform rotation, one can write "alpha" as a function of the total
(rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is
characteristic of the topology/connectedness and the geometric shape of a
system. "Alpha" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of
differentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal
models whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known. We
also estimate "alpha" for gaseous toroidal models and for stellar disk systems
embedded in an inert or responsive "halo". We find that the new stability
criterion holds equally well for all these previously published axisymmetric
models.

We review and discuss information on the mass distribution of galaxy clusters
obtained from gravitational lensing.

We examine the width of the gamma-ray burst luminosity function through the
distribution of GRB peak fluxes as detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO)
and the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE). The strength of the
analysis is greatly enhanced by using a merged catalog of peak fluxes from both
instruments with good cross-calibration of their sensitivities. The range of
peak fluxes is increased by approximately a factor of 20 relative to the BATSE
catalog. Thus, more sensitive investigations of the $\log N-\log P$
distribution are possible. We place constraints on the width of the luminosity
function of gamma-ray bursts brighter than the BATSE completeness limit by
comparing the intensity distribution in the merged catalog with those produced
by a variety of spatial density and luminosity functions. For the models
examined, $90\%$ of the {\em detectable\/} bursts have peak luminosities within
a range of 10, indicating that the peak luminosities of gamma-ray bursts span a
markedly less wide range of values than many other of their measurable
properties. We also discuss for which slopes of a power-law luminosity function
the observed width is at the upper end of the constrained range. This is
important in determining the power-law slopes for which luminosity-duration
correlations could be important.

We detect anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at degree
angular scales and confirm a previous detection reported by Wollack et al.
(1993). The root-mean-squared amplitude of the fluctuations is $44^{+13}_{-7}
\mu$K. This may be expressed as the square root of the angular power spectrum
in a band of multipoles between $l_{eff}=69^{+29}_{-22}$. We find $\delta T_l =
\sqrt{l(2l+1)<|a_l^m|^2>/4\pi} = 42^{+12}_{-7} \mu$K. The measured spectral
index of the fluctuations is consistent with zero, the value expected for the
CMB. The spectral index corresponding to Galactic free-free emission, the most
likely foreground contaminant, is rejected at approximately $3\sigma$.
  The analysis is based on three independent data sets. The first, taken in
1993, spans the 26 - 36 GHz frequency range with three frequency bands; the
second was taken with the same radiometer as the first but during an
independent observing campaign in 1994; and the third, also take in 1994, spans
the 36-46 GHz range in three bands. For each telescope position and radiometer
channel, the drifts in the instrument offset are $\le 4~\mu$K/day over a period
of one month. The dependence of the inferred anisotropy on the calibration and
data editing is addressed.

Enhanced chromospheric emission which corresponds to an outwardly increasing
semiempirical temperature structure can be produced by wave motion without any
increase in the mean gas temperture. Hence, the sun may not have a classical
chromosphere in magnetic field free internetwork regions. Other significant
differences between the properties of dynamic and static atmospheres should be
considered when analyzing chromospheric observations.

We have observed the hard X-ray source 1E1740.7-2942 in the HCO+ (1-0) line
using the Owens Valley millimeter interferometer. Previous single dish
observations have found HCO+ emission coincident with the location of the radio
continuum hot spots of the radio source associated with 1E1740.7-2942. Our
higher resolution observations show a 15 arcsec offset between the HCO+
emission and the location of the radio hot spots. We propose that the lack of
emission results from a large ionization rate, exceeding $10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$,
in the neighborhood of 1E1740.7-2942.

We start by pedagigically reviewing the problem of large scale magnetic
fields. We explain the acquisition of angular momentum in the general context
of Dark Matter models and we use this result to derive a dynamical mechanism
for magnetic field generation. This mechanism does not produce any magnetic
field for standard CDM, but it does for a large class of other models. We apply
this mechanism in the context of the texture scenario of large-scale structure
formation. Resulting constraints on the texture scenario and other models are
discussed.

Fragmentation process in a cylindrical magnetized cloud is studied with the
nested grid method. The nested grid scheme use 15 levels of grids with
different spatial resolution overlaid subsequently, which enables us to trace
the evolution from the molecular cloud density $\sim 100 {\rm cm}^{-3}$ to that
of the protostellar disk $\sim 10^{10} {\rm cm} ^{-3}$ or more. Fluctuation
with small amplitude grows by the gravita- tional instability. It forms a disk
perpendicular to the magnetic fields which runs in the direction parallel to
the major axis of the cloud. Matter accrets on to the disk mainly flowing along
the magnetic fields and this makes the column density increase. The radial
inflow, whose velocity is slower than that perpendicular to the disk, is driven
by the increase of the gravity. While the equation of state is isothermal and
magnetic fields are perfectly coupled with the matter, which is realized in the
density range of $\rho \lesssim 10^{10} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, never stops the
contraction. The structure of the contracting disk reaches that of a singular
solution as the density and the column density obey $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ and
$\sigma(r) \propto r^{-1}$, respectively. The magnetic field strength on the
mid-plane is proportional to $\rho(r)^{1/2}$ and further that of the center
($B_c$) evolves as proportional to the square root of the gas density ($\propto
\rho_c^{1/2}$). It is shown that isothermal clouds experience ``run-away''
collapses. The evolution after the equation of state becomes hard is also
discussed.

Numerical models for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy have been computed
with the new stellar yields published by Maeder (1992). These metallicity
dependent yields represent an important improvement in the chemical evolution
of galaxies but there are still uncertainties in the stellar evolution which
prevent completely satisfactory results. {}From the comparison of the model
predictions with the corresponding observational constraints we find that
Maeder's nucleosynthesis reproduces the oxygen and carbon abundances and
provides consistent $\Delta$Y/$\Delta$(O/H) ratios if a significant amount of
gas is accreted by the galactic disc during its whole lifetime. The lower mass
limit for the black hole formation (M$_{bh}$) must be larger than 22.5
M$_{\odot}$ to avoid oxygen underproduction.

We present a theoretical model for the ionized disk in M87 which includes
spiral shock waves. The line emission profiles computed from this model at
various positions on the disk are found to be in agreement with the recent
Hubble Space Telescope results. Based on this model, we find that the ionized
disk comprises two-armed giant spiral shock waves which extend from around
$0.1$ arc sec from the center to at least $1$ arc second or more. Our model
requires that the mass of the black hole be $(4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^9 M_\odot$
and the inclination angle to be $(42\pm 2)^{\deg}$. We predict the nature of
the line profiles at many other locations of the disk which could be verified
in future observations.

We show that the 4.44 and 6.13 MeV line emission observed with COMPTEL from
Orion is consistent with gamma ray spectra consisting of a mixture of narrow
and broad lines or spectra containing only broad lines. We employed several
accelerated particle compositions and showed that the current COMPTEL data in
the 3--7 MeV region alone cannot distinguish between the various possibilities.
However, the COMPTEL upper limits in the 1--3 MeV band favor a composition
similar to that of the winds of Wolf-Rayet stars of spectral type WC. The power
dissipated by the accelerated particles at Orion is about 4 $\times$ 10$^{38}$
erg s$^{-1}$. These particles are not expected to produce significant amounts
of $^{26}$Al.

Classification of galaxy spectral energy distributions in terms of orthogonal
basis functions provides an objective means of estimating the number of
significant spectral components that comprise a particular galaxy type. We
apply the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve transform to derive a spectral eigensystem from a
sample of ten galaxy spectral energy distributions. These spectra cover a
wavelength range of 1200 \AA\ to 1 $\mu$m and galaxy morphologies from
elliptical to starburst. We find that the distribution of spectral types can be
fully described by the first two eigenvectors (or eigenspectra). The derived
eigenbasis is affected by the normalization of the original spectral energy
distributions. We investigate different normalization and weighting schemes,
including weighting to the same bolometric magnitude and weighting by the
observed distribution of morphological types. Projecting the spectral energy
distributions on to their eigenspectra we find that the coefficients define a
simple spectral classification scheme. The galaxy spectral types can then be
described in terms of a one parameter family (the angle in the plane of the
first two eigenvectors). We find a strong correlation in the mean between our
spectral classifications and those determined from published morphological
classifications.

We investigate, using high resolution N-body simulations, the density
profiles and the morphologies of galaxy clusters in three models of structure
formation. We show that these properties are closely related to the occurrence
of a significant merging event to a cluster in the recent past. The three
models are: (1) the standard CDM model (SCDM) with $\Omega_0 = 1$,
$\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.5$; (2) a low-density flat model (LCDM) with
$\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$; (3) a CDM dominated open model
(OCDM) with $\Omega_0=0.1$, $\Lambda_0=0$. We find that the clusters in the
OCDM model have the steepest density profiles, their density contours are the
roundest and show the smallest center shifts, among the three models. The
clusters in the SCDM model have contours that are most elongated and show the
largest center shifts, indicating the existence of frequent mergers in the
recent past. The clusters in the LCDM model have density profiles and center
shifts (in their density contours) similar to those in the SCDM model, although
the density contours tend to be rounder. Our results show that, although the
density profiles and morphologies of clusters depend on models of structure
formation, the LCDM model, which is currently considered as a successful
alternative to the SCDM model, can do as well in producing a substantial
fraction of clusters with substructures. This is in contrast to the conception
that this model may have serious problem in this aspect.

We have combined five Tully-Fisher (TF) redshift-distance samples for
peculiar velocity analysis: the cluster data of Han, Mould and coworkers
(1991-93, HM) and Willick (1991, W91CL), and the field data of Aaronson et al.
(1992), Willick (1991), Courteau & Faber (1992), and Mathewson et al. (1992),
totaling over 3000 spiral galaxies. We treat the cluster data in this paper,
which is the first of a series; in Paper II we treat the field TF samples.
These data are to be combined with elliptical data (e.g., Faber et al. 1989) to
form the MARK III CATALOG OF GALAXY PECULIAR VELOCITIES, which we will present
in Paper III. The catalog will be used as input for POTENT reconstruction of
velocity and density fields, described in later papers, as well as for
alternative velocity analyses. Our main goal in Papers I & II is to place the
TF data onto a self-consistent system by (i) applying a uniform set of
corrections to the raw observables, (ii) determining the TF slopes and scatters
separately for each sample, and (iii) adjusting the TF zeropoints to ensure
mutually consistent distances. The global zeropoint is set by the HM sample,
chosen because of its depth and uniformity on the sky and its substantial
overlap with each of the other samples. In this paper, we calibrate the
``forward'' and ``inverse'' TF relations for HM and W91CL. We study the
selection criteria for these samples and correct for the resultant statistical
biases. The bias corrections are validated by comparing forward and inverse
cluster distances. We find that many sample clusters are better modeled as
``expanding'' than relaxed, which significantly affects the TF calibrations.
Proper corrections for internal extinction are derived self-consistently from
the data.

We propose a new technique, which we call the lens parallax method, to
determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies
and the mass distribution of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is
based on gravitational lensing and uses the fact that the mean angular size of
the faint blue galaxies is a well-determined function of surface brightness.
The method requires first a calibration of the angular-size vs. surface
brightness relation in unlensed blank fields and a determination of the mean
redshift of the brightest of the faint blue galaxies. By combining this
information with observations of the distorted images of background galaxies in
the fields of foreground clusters, we show that it is possible to obtain the
mean redshift of the galaxies as a function of their surface brightness. With a
sample of about ten moderate redshift rich clusters and using ten bins in
surface brightness, a bin-to-bin signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim3.5$ can be
achieved. The method simultaneously allows a determination of the convergence
and shear of the lensing cluster as a function of position, and through this
the mass distribution of the lens can be obtained. The lens parallax method can
be used in conjunction with, and will improve the accuracy of, other previously
proposed techniques for mapping clusters.

This paper summarises two recently developed techniques in power spectral
analysis and their application to a sample of X-ray light curves of accreting
collapsed objects in active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. The first
technique is designed to carry out detailed model fitting of continuum power
spectrum components arising from noise variability by using maximum likelihood
methods. The technique is applied to the light curves of a number of highly
variable AGNs observed with EXOSAT. Substantially steeper logarithmic power
spectrum slopes are obtained than previously estimated with standard methods.
The second technique was devised in order to reveal coherent periodicities in
the presence of ``coloured" (i.e. non--white) noise variability components from
the source. To this aim the power spectra are searched for significant narrow
peaks superposed on the ``coloured" continuum components. We present the
results of a search for an orbital modulation in the light curves of a sample
of 25 low mass X--ray binaries (LMXRBs), for which the orbital period is either
unknown or detected only at optical wavelengths. This led to the discovery of a
significant X--ray orbital modulation at the few percent level in the burster
MXB1636-539.

Low resolution spectroscopy, and UBVRI photometry, have been obtained for the
two EROS microlensing candidates. Radial velocities indicate that both stars
are members of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The spectrum and the colours of
EROS1, the first candidate, reveal that it is a moderately reddened
main-sequence B star with H emission lines. The presence of H absorption lines
seems to be more the signature of a normal star than that of a cataclysmic
variable. As to EROS2, the second candidate, its spectrum and photometry are
those of an unreddened normal main-sequence A star, but it cannot be totally
excluded that they represent those of a nova in the pre-outburst phase.
Although it is not yet possible to exclude intrinsic stellar variations, the
interpretation in terms of microlensing effects remain the most natural one.

If the large-scale galaxy distribution is filamentary, as suggested by some
observations and recent hydrodynamical simulations, then lengthwise views of
filaments will apparently produce compact groups (CGs) that are in reality
stretched out along the line of sight. This possibility has been advocated
recently by Hernquist, Katz \& Weinberg (1994). Here, we propose a test for
this hypothesis using X--ray emission from CGs. The observable quantity $Q
\equiv L_{x} a_{p}^{3}/L_{g}^2 T_{x}^{1/2}$ should be proportional to the axis
ratio of the group, $a/c$, where $a$ and $c$ are the long and short axis of a
prolate distribution, $a_p$ is the radius of the group projected onto the sky,
$L_{x}$ is the bolometric X-ray luminosity, $L_{g}$ is the group blue
luminosity, and $T_{x}$ is the gas temperature. We find that the distribution
of $Q$ is consistent with the notion that many spiral-rich CGs with unusually
small values of ($a/c)$ are frauds, i.e. that the values of $Q$ are anomalously
small. An alternative possibility is that CGs are gas-poor relative to rich
clusters; however, this can be tested using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. If
the groups have a normal ratio of gas-to-total mass, but are simply stretched
out along the line of sight, a Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal should be detectable.

A platelet collapse model of starquakes is introduced. It displays
self-organized criticality with a robust power-law behavior. The simulations
indicate a near-constant exponent, whenever scaling is present.

Groups and clusters of galaxies hosting a quasar can be found through the
detection of Lyman-alpha absorption lines beyond the quasar redshift. The
effect occurs whenever the distortion to the redshift distribution of
Lyman-alpha clouds induced by the cluster potential extends beyond the
proximity effect of the quasar. Based on CDM cosmological models for the
evolution of structure, we predict the probability for finding lines beyond the
quasar redshift ($z_{abs}>z_Q$) under the assumption that the physical
properties of Lyman-alpha clouds are not affected by flows on large scales (1
Mpc and more) in the quasi-linear regime. If quasars randomly sample the
underlying galaxy distribution, the expected number of lines with $z_{abs}>z_Q$
per quasar can be as high as 0.25[(dN/dz)/350] at $z=2$, where $dN/dz$ is the
number of Lyman-alpha lines per unit redshift far from the quasar. The
probability is enhanced if quasars typically reside in small groups of
galaxies. A statistical excess of Lyman-alpha lines is expected near very dim
quasars or around metal absorption systems. Due to clustering, the standard
approach to the proximity effect overestimates the ionizing background flux at
high redshifts by up to a factor of 3. This result weakens the discrepancy
between the deduced background flux and the contribution from known populations
of quasars.

Early-type galaxies from CfA catalogue were assotiated with IRAS FSC sources.
In given sample IR and optical properties were used to obtain some
classification of these objects. The existance of significant classes can be
evidence of presence one main type of the dust in each galaxy. Physical
interpretation of obtained classes was discussed. The dust mass in two classes
of galaxies can be calculated using evolution modelling. In this case we can
obtain a estimations for chemical composition and initial mass function in
these galaxies.

We present a numerical method to solve the equations of general relativistic
hydrodynamics in a given external gravitational field. The method is based on a
generalization of Roe's approximate Riemann solver for the non relativistic
Euler equations in Cartesian coordinates. The new method is applied to a set of
standard test problems for general relativistic hydrodynamics, and is shown to
perform well in comparison to existing numerical schemes. In contrast to
existing explicit methods the present method can cope with strong relativistic
shocks. By-products are: the characteristic form of the general relativistic
Euler equations, a numerical method for special relativity that can deal with
strong discontinuities, a numerical scheme for the integration of the Euler
equations in an arbitrary coordinate system, possibly under the influence of
(external) gravity, and a novel method to incorporate source terms in numerical
schemes.

Standard models for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy are reviewed with
particular emphasis on the history of the abundance gradients in the disk. The
effects on the disk structure and metallicity of gas accretion are discussed,
showing that a significant fraction of the current disk mass has been accreted
in the last Gyrs and that the chemical abundances of the infalling gas can be
non primordial but should not exceed 0.3 Z(sun). The distributions with time
and with galactocentric distance of chemical elements are discussed, comparing
the observational data with the corresponding theoretical predictions by
standard models, which reproduce very well the ISM abundances at various
epochs, but not equally well all the features derived from observations of old
stellar objects.

We consider axisymmetric viscous accretion flows where a fraction f of the
viscously dissipated energy is advected with the accreting gas as stored
entropy and a fraction 1-f is radiated. When f is small (i.e. very little
advection), our solutions resemble standard thin disks in many respects except
that they have a hot tenuous corona above. In the opposite {\it
advection-dominated} limit ($f\rightarrow1$), the solutions approach nearly
spherical accretion. The gas is almost at virial temperature, rotates at much
below the Keplerian rate, and the flow is much more akin to Bondi accretion
than to disk accretion. We compare our exact self-similar solutions with
approximate solutions previously obtained using a height-integrated system of
equations. We conclude that the height- integration approximation is excellent
for a wide range of conditions. We find that the Bernoulli parameter is
positive in all our solutions, especially close to the rotation axis. This
effect is produced by viscous transport of energy from small to large radii and
from the equator to the poles. In addition, all the solutions are convectively
unstable and the convection is especially important near the rotation axis. For
both reasons we suggest that a bipolar outflow will develop along the axis of
the flows, fed by material from the the surface layers of the equatorial
inflow.

We describe new optically thin solutions for rotating accretion flows around
black holes and neutron stars. These solutions are advection dominated, so that
most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected radially with the flow. We
model the accreting gas as a two temperature plasma and include cooling by
bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Comptonization. We obtain electron
temperatures $T_e\sim 10^{8.5}-10^{10}$K. The new solutions are present only
for mass accretion rates $\dot M$ less than a critical rate $\dot M_{crit}$
which we calculate as a function of radius $R$ and viscosity parameter
$\alpha$. For $\dot M<\dot M_{crit}$ we show that there are three equilibrium
branches of solutions. One of the branches corresponds to a cool optically
thick flow which is the well-known thin disk solution of Shakura \& Sunyaev
(1973). Another branch corresponds to a hot optically thin flow, discovered
originally by Shapiro, Lightman \& Eardley (1976, SLE). This solution is
thermally unstable. The third branch corresponds to our new advection-dominated
solution. This solution is hotter and more optically thin than the SLE
solution, but is viscously and thermally stable. It is related to the ion torus
model of Rees et al. (1982) and may potentially explain the hard X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

The enigmatic radio source Sagittarius A* at the centre of our Galaxy appears
to be a low-luminosity version of active galactic nuclei in other galaxies. By
analogy with active galactic nuclei models, it has been proposed that Sgr A*
may be a massive accreting black holes. The black hole hypothesis is, however,
problematic because no model of Sgr A* has been able to explain the observed
spectrum in any self-consistent way, and there is no consensus on either the
mass of the black hole or the mass accretion rate. Sgr A* has been observed in
the radio, sub-mm, infrared, and X-ray bands, and the various various
detections and flux upper limits cover more than ten decades of frequency, from
$\nu\sles\ 10^9$ Hz (meter wavelength radio bands) up to $\nu\ \sgreat\
10^{19}$ Hz (150 keV X-rays). We present a robust model of Sgr A* in which a
million solar mass black hole accretes at the rate of a few $\times10^{-6}$
solar masses per year. This model fits the entire spectrum self-consistently.
The unique feature of the model is that the flow is advection-dominated, i.e.
most of the energy viscously dissipated in the differentially rotating flow is
carried along with the gas and lost through the horizon. The apparent success
of this model in explaining the data may be considered ``proof'' that horizons
are real and that a massive black hole does exist at the Galactic center.

We report the discovery of 45 beat Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) using the MACHO Project photometry database. The variables which are
pulsating simultaneously in two radial modes are shown to break cleanly into
two period-ratio groups, providing the first unambiguous evidence that the
second overtone is indeed excited in real Cepheids. Thirty stars are beating in
the fundamental and first overtone mode (F/1H, with a period ratio in the
neighborhood of 0.72), and fifteen stars are beating in the first and second
overtone (1H/2H, with a period ratio near 0.80). The F/1H period ratios are
systematically higher than known Galactic beat Cepheids, indicating a
metallicity dependence whose sense is in agreement with theory. Beat Cepheids
in the LMC are found to select the 1H/2H mode for fundamental periods shorter
than 1.25 days. We find the fraction of Cepheids excited in two modes to be
about 20\% for stars with fundamental periods shorter than 2.5 days. We fail to
confirm any of the proposed beat Cepheid candidates common to our sample from
the surveys of Andreasen (1987) and Andreasen \& Petersen (1987). We also
present finder charts and find several of the beat Cepheids to be in or near
LMC clusters.

We explore the nature of the evolution of faint field galaxies by assuming
that the local luminosity function is not well defined. We use a non-negative
least squares technique to derive a near optimal set of local luminosity
functions for different spectral types of galaxies by fitting to the observed
optical and near-infrared counts, B-R colors, and redshift distributions for
galaxies with 15 < B < 27. We report here the results of using only traditional
luminosity evolution (ie. the photometric evolution of stars in a galaxy over
time given reasonable assumptions of the form of the star formation history for
various galaxy types), and simple galaxy reddening and find excellent fits to
the observed data to B = 27. We conclude that models more exotic than
traditional luminosity evolution are not yet required to explain existing faint
field galaxy data and thus the need for contributions by mergers or new
populations of galaxies is at least 5x less than previously estimated.

We present spatial, temporal and spectral analyses of ROSAT Position
Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxies
Ark 564, NGC 985, Kaz 163, Mrk 79 and RX J2256.6+0525. Ark 564 is a powerful
narrow-line Seyfert 1 with strong Fe II emission. Several similar narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies have recently been found to have remarkably steep soft X-ray
continua as well as rapid X-ray variability. We find that Ark 564 also has a
very steep ($\Gamma > 3$) 0.1--2.5 keV spectrum and varies by $\sim 20$ per
cent in 1500 s. We examine models for Ark 564 in light of both its X-ray and
optical characteristics, and suggest a possible connection between the steep
X-ray spectra of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and their narrow lines. NGC 985
has a large soft excess, a warm absorber, or both. The three other Seyferts
have systematically steeper spectra than are typically observed for Seyferts in
higher energy Ginga data, indicating that they also harbour further spectral
complexity. Kaz 163 shows $\sim 45$ per cent intensity variability in the
0.1--2.5 keV band, and Mrk 79 shows evidence for variability as well.

Rapidly rotating magnetic neutron stars in eccentric binary systems
containing an early type star provide a unique opportunity to investigate the
interplay between radio pulsar, stellar wind and accretion phenomena. We
summarise the radio pulsar-dominated and the accretion-dominated regimes,
discussing how the transition from one regime to another can take place as a
result of the varying orbital distance and relative velocity along the orbit,
as well as changes of the wind characteristics. We derive the conditions under
which the two known B star/radio pulsar binaries (PSR 1259-63 and PSR
J0045-7319) can undergo a transition to the accreting regime. A strong increase
of the mass loss ouflow from the companion is required, just to cause the onset
of accretion onto the magnetospheric boundary. We also show that the X--ray
transient A0538-66 is likely to undergo transitions from the accreting neutron
star regime, to the regime of accretion onto the magnetosphere. These two
regimes might correspond to the high (> 10^{38} erg/s) and the low-luminosity
(< 10^{38} erg/s) outbursts observed from this source. A radio pulsar might
become detectable in the long quiescent states of A0538-66. A new model of the
enigmatic high-energy binary LS I +61 303 involving accretion onto the
magnetosphere is also presented.

The problem of solving perturbatively the equations describing the evolution
of self-gravitating collisionless matter in an expanding universe considerably
simplifies when directly formulated in terms of the gravitational and velocity
potentials: the problem can be solved {\it exactly}, rather than approximately,
even for cosmological models with arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$. The
Eulerian approach we present here allows to calculate the higher-order moments
of the initially Gaussian density and velocity fields: in particular, we
compute the gravitationally induced skewness of the density and
velocity-divergence fields for any value of $\Omega$, confirming the extremely
weak $\Omega$-dependence of the skewness previously obtained via Lagrangian
perturbation theory. Our results show that the separability assumption of
higher-order Eulerian perturbative solutions is restricted to the Einstein-de
Sitter case only.

Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are the most insignificant extragalactic stellar
systems in terms of their visibility, but potentially very significant in terms
of their role in the formation and evolution of much more luminous galaxies. We
discuss the present observational data and their implications for theories of
the formation and evolution of both dwarf and giant galaxies. The putative dark
matter content of these low-surface-brightness systems is of particular
interest, as is their chemical evolution. Surveys for new dwarf spheroidals
hidden behind the stars of our Galaxy and those which are not bound to giant
galaxies may give new clues as to the origins of this unique class of galaxy.

There are many fundamental aspects of Galactic structure and evolution which
can be studied best or exclusively with high quality three dimensional
kinematics. Amongst these we note as examples determination of the orientation
of the stellar velocity ellipsoid, and the detection of structure in
velocity-position phase space. The first of these is the primary limitation at
present to reliable and accurate measurement of the Galactic gravitational
potential. The second is a critical test of current standard models of Galactic
formation and detection of structure in velocity-position phase space. The
first of these is the primary limitation at present to reliable and accurate
measurement of the Galactic gravitational potential. The second is a critical
test of current standard models of Galactic formation and evolution.

Correlations between stellar kinematics and chemical abundances are fossil
evidence for evolutionary connections between Galactic structural components.
Extensive stellar surveys show that the only tolerably clear distinction
between galactic components appears in the distributions of specific angular
momentum. Here the stellar metal-poor halo and the metal-rich bulge are
indistinguishable from each other, as are the thick disk and the old disk. Each
pair is very distinct from the other. This leads to an evolutionary model in
which the metal-poor stellar halo evolves into the inner bulge, while the thick
disk is a precursor to the thin disk. These evolutionary sequences are
distinct. The galaxy is made of two discrete `populations', one of low and one
of high angular momentum. Some (minor?) complexity is added to this picture by
the debris of late and continuing mergers, which will be especially important
in the outer stellar halo.

There is an obvious need for automated classification of galaxies, as the
number of observed galaxies increases very fast. We examine several approaches
to this problem, utilising {\em Artificial Neural Networks} (ANNs). We quote
results from a recent study which show that ANNs can classsify galaxies
morphologically as well as humans can.

We attempt to de-mistify Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by considering
special cases which are related to other statistical methods common in
Astronomy and other fields. In particular we show how ANNs generalise Bayesian
methods, multi-parameter fitting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Wiener
filtering and regularisation methods. Examples of morphological classification
of galaxies illustrate how non-linear ANNs improve on linear techniques.

We show that the relatively strong magnetic fields ($\ge 1 \mu$G) in high
redshift objects can be explained by the combined action of an evolving
protogalactic fluctuation and electrodynamic processes providing the magnetic
seed fields. Three different seed field mechanisms are reviewed and
incorporated into a spherical "top-hat" model and tidal torque theory for the
fate of a forming galaxy in an expanding universe. Very weak fields $10^{-19}
\sim 10^{-23}$G created in an expanding over-dense region are strongly enhanced
due to the dissipative disk formation by a factor $\sim 10^4$, and subsequently
amplified by strong non-axisymmetric flow by a factor $\sim 10^{6-10}$,
depending on the cosmological parameters and the epoch of galaxy formation. The
resulting field strength at $z \sim 0.395$ can be of the order of a few $\mu$G
and be close to this value at $z \sim 2$.

We study the formation of Li lines in a case study of an S-type AGB star in
the SMC. AGB stars may be important providers of $^7$Li to the interstellar
medium. Abundance analysis of these stars is difficult due to the heavy
molecular blanketing, uncertainties in the model atmospheres and possible
departures from LTE in the Li atomic level populations. We address here the
latter problem and somewhat also that of background molecular line formation.
We do not find non-LTE effects big enough to alone rule out the possibility
that the reported super-Li-rich stars exist. There are, however, several other
complications connected to the formation of the Li lines in these stars.

The spectrum of the quasar Q0055-269 ($z=3.66$) has been observed at the
resolution of 14 km s$^{-1}$ in the wavelength interval 4750--6300 \AA. We give
a list of Lyman$-\alpha$ lines and metal-line systems for which column
densities and Doppler widths have been derived by a fitting procedure. The
statistical distribution of the Doppler parameter for the Lyman$-\alpha$ lines
is peaked at $b\simeq 23$ km s$^{-1}$, with 13\% of lines with $15\leq b\leq
20$ km s$^{-1}$. The column density distribution of the Lyman$-\alpha$ lines is
described by a power-law with a break or cutoff at $\log N_{HI} \simeq 14.5$. A
featureless power-law distribution is rejected with a probability of $99.94$\%.
Significant clustering, with $\xi \simeq 1$ at $\Delta v=100$ km s$^{-1}$, is
detected only for lines with $\log N_{HI}\magcir 13.8$. In addition, two voids
of size $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$ are found in the spectrum with a random
probability of $2\times 10^{-4}$. {}From the proximity effect for lines in the
interval $\log N_{HI}=13.3-14.2$ it is possible to infer an UV ionizing
background $J=5\times 10^{-22}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$,
within a factor of two from the integrated quasar contribution.

We report X-ray observations of the radio galaxies B2 1615+35 (NGC 6109) and
B2 1621+38 (NGC 6137), which belong to poor groups of galaxies and are
characterized by a "head-tail" structure. We also analyze the X-ray behaviour
of the radio galaxy NGC 6107, present within the field of view and showing a
symmetric extended radio structure. The X-ray emission from the group of
1615+35 is complex, including both emission from a hot intergroup gas, and
emission from the individual radio galaxies (1615+35 itself, which is
pointlike, and NGC 6107, which is extended). In the case of 1621+38, only
extended X-ray emission from the galaxy itself is detected. The extended X-ray
emission of the galaxies 1621+38 and NGC 6107 is probably related to a gaseous
galactic atmosphere. The pointlike emission of the radio galaxy 1615+35,
instead, is likely to originate in the nucleus. We discuss the confinement of
radio components by the ambient gas, and find that the external thermal
pressure exceeds the internal equipartition pressure. The X-ray emitting plasma
in the 1615+35 group is characterized by luminosity, temperature and
metallitcity typical for groups, i.e. lower than for rich clusters.

Deep color-magnitude diagrams are presented for poorly known open clusters Cr
261, Be 18, Be 54, Tr 5 and BH176. All clusters are old objects with age\geq 4
Gyr. BH176 is either old open cluster or young globular cluster. Extremely red
giants with V-I>3 were identified in the central parts of Cr 261, Be 54 and
BH176. These three objects are candidates for very metal-rich clusters.

The central area of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy was surveyed for variable stars
as a side-program of the OGLE project. Light curves in the V band were obtained
for 226 RR Lyr stars and for 3 anomalous cepheids. One previously unknown
anomalous cepheid was identified. We discovered also two variables located at
the tip of the red giant branch of Sculptor. Out of 226 RR Lyr variables 135
were classified as RRab, 88 as RRc and 2 as RRd. Distribution of periods for
RRab stars shows a sharp cut-off at P=0.475 days. This implies that the bulk of
Sculptor RR Lyr stars has metallicity [Fe/H]\leq -1.7 on the Zinn-West scale.
The average V magnitudes of RRab variables are correlated with their periods.
This effect is most probably caused by the spread of metallicities exhibited by
variables. Based on the average V magnitudes of RR Lyr stars the apparent
distance modulus of Sculptor was determined at (m-M)_{V}=19.71. The
color-magnitude diagram of Sculptor reaching V\approx 21.4 and I\approx 20.6 is
presented. The observed width of the upper part of the red giant branch
indicates range of metallicities -2.2\leq [Fe/H]\leq -1.6 for the Sculptor
giants. The observed distribution of stars along the horizontal branch and
average value of metallicity imply that age of Sculptor is similar to ages of
the relatively young globular clusters from the outer galactic halo. The data
about RR Lyr variables in four nearby dwarf galaxies are summarized and
discussed briefly.

We present extended simulations of the distribution of galaxy clusters in
different dark matter models, using an optimized version of the Zel'dovich
approximation. Six different dark matter models are studied: Standard CDM, Open
CDM, Tilted CDM, Cold + Hot DM, low-density CDM with cosmological constant, and
low Hubble constant ($h=0.3$) CDM. We compare simulations with an Abell/ACO
redshift sample. We find that the models that best reproduce the clustering of
the real data sets are the Cold + Hot DM model and the CDM model with a
cosmological constant. The probability density function of all models and data
is always well approximated by a lognormal distribution. We also find that the
linear biasing parameter for the simulated clusters is nearly constant over a
large range of scales, but its value depends on the model. We also note that
the abundances of clusters predicted by the Press-Schechter theory provide
strong constraints on these models: only the Cold + Hot DM model and the low-H
CDM model appear to produce the correct number-density of clusters. Taking this
constraint together with the cluster clustering statistics leads one to
conclude that the best of our models is the Cold + Hot DM scenario.

We investigate the integrated spectra of a sample of 24 normal galaxies. A
principal component analysis suggests that most of the variance present in the
spectra is due to the differences in morphology of the galaxies in the sample.
We show that spectroscopic parameters extracted from the spectra, like the
amplitude of the 4000 \AA~ break or of the CN band, correlate well with Hubble
types and are useful for quantitative classification.

A viable solution to the origin of close binary systems, unaccounted for in
recent theories, is presented. Fragmentation, occurring at the end of the
secondary collapse phase (during which molecular hydrogen is dissociating), can
form binary systems with separations less than 1 au. Two fragmentation modes
are found to occur after the collapse is halted. The first consists of the
fragmentation of a protostellar disc due to rotational instabilities in a
protostellar core, involving both an $m=1$ and an $m=2$ mode. This
fragmentation mechanism is found to be insensitive to the initial density
distribution: it can occur in both centrally condensed and uniform initial
conditions. The second fragmentation mode involves the formation of a rapidly
rotating core at the end of the collapse phase which is unstable to the
axisymmetric perturbations. This core bounces into a ring which quickly
fragments into several components. The binary systems thus formed contain less
than 1 per cent of a solar mass and therefore will need to accrete most of
their final mass if they are to form a binary star system. Their orbital
properties will thus be determined by the properties of the accreted matter.

Standard $\Omega_0=1$ cold dark matter (CDM) needs $0.27 < \sigma_8 < 0.63$
($2\sigma$) to fit the observed number of large separation lenses, and the
constraint is nearly independent of $H_0=100h^{-1}\kms$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This range
is strongly inconsistent with the COBE estimate of $\sigma_8=(2.8\pm0.2)h$.
Tilting the primordial spectrum $\propto k^n$ from $n=1$ to $0.3 \ltorder n
\ltorder 0.7$, using an effective Hubble constant of $0.15 \ltorder \Gamma=h
\ltorder 0.30$, or reducing the matter density to $0.15 \ltorder \Omega_0 h
\ltorder 0.3$ either with no cosmological constant ($\lambda_0=0$) or in a flat
universe with a cosmological constant ($\Omega_0+\lambda_0=1$) can bring the
lensing estimate of $\sigma_8$ into agreement with the COBE estimates. The
models and values for $\sigma_8$ consistent with both lensing and COBE match
the estimates from the local number density of clusters and correlation
functions. The conclusions are insensitive to systematic errors except for the
assumption that cluster core radii are singular. If clusters with
$\rho\propto(r^2+s^2)^{-1}$ have core radii exceeding $s = 15h^{-1}\sigma_3^2$
kpc for a cluster with velocity dispersion $\sigma=10^3\sigma_3 \kms$ then the
estimates are invalid. There is, however, a fine tuning problem in making the
cluster core radii large enough to invalidate the estimates of $\sigma_8$ while
producing several lenses that do not have central or ``odd images.'' The
estimated completeness of the current samples of lenses larger than $5\parcs0$
is 20\%, because neither quasar surveys nor lens surveys are optimized to this
class of lenses.

Intrinsic color profiles of a sample of nine Brightest Cluster Galaxies
(BCGs) are recovered from the observed color profiles by evaluating spurious
gradients introduced by errors in the determination of the sky levels and by
different seeing conditions between the observations. Isophote shapes and
surface brightness profiles are presented for the four newly observed BCGs.
Three out of nine BCGs show color gradients of the order of 0.10 mag per decade
in radius. Five BCGs do not possess any color gradient larger than 0.01 mag per
decade in radius. We do not see any correlation between the presence (or the
sign) of a color gradient and the BCG morphology (slope and shape of its
surface brightness profile), or the cluster richness. This argues against a
strong and recent influence of the environment on the BCG morphology. The slope
of the BCG surface brightness profile is correlated to the cluster richness,
posing a constraint on the initial conditions, or on the physical mechanism
that is responsible for the present BCG morphology. Finally, only one BCG can
be a cD despite visual classification as such of all studied BCGs.

When applied to the blast wave formed by the explosion of a massive star as a
supernova (SN), the theory of diffusive particle acceleration at shock fronts
predicts a very high energy density in cosmic rays. Almost immediately after
particles begin to be injected into the process, the cosmic ray pressure rises
until comparable to the ram-pressure encountered by the shock front. Those
supernovae which are observed in the radio band i.e., radio supernovae (RSNe),
provide direct evidence of particle acceleration in the form of synchrotron
emitting electrons. Furthermore, these objects are particularly interesting,
since they are usually surrounded by a relatively dense confining medium. The
acceleration of cosmic rays can then lead to the production of very high energy
(VHE) gamma-rays which arise from collisions between energetic particles and
target nuclei. We estimate the cosmic ray energy density assuming a fraction
$\phi\lesim1$ of the energy available at the shock front is converted into
cosmic rays. Combining this with the parameters describing the environment of
the SN progenitor, as deduced from observations, and from more detailed
modelling, we compute the flux at Earth $\tevflux$ of photons of energy above
$1\,$TeV. For the relatively weak but nearby supernova SN1987A we predict
$\tevflux=2\times10^{-13}\,\fluxunits$ before the shock front encounters the
ring of dense matter seen by the Hubble Space Telescope. Subsequently, the flux
is expected to rise further. The medium around SN1993J in M81 is thought to
have a density

Most physical properties derived for quasars, as single entities or as a
population, depend upon the cosmology assumed. In this paper, we calculate the
quasar luminosity function and some related quantities for a flat universe
dominated by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ ($\Lambda=0.9, \Omega=0.1$) and
compare them with those deduced for a flat universe with zero cosmological
constant ($\Lambda=0,\Omega=1$). We use the AAT quasar survey data (Boyle et
al. 1990) as input in both cases. The data are fit well by a pure luminosity
evolution model for both the cosmologies, but with different evolutionary
parameters. From the luminosity function, we predict (extrapolate) a greater
number of quasars at faint apparent magnitudes (twice the number at B=24, $z <
2.2$) for the $\Lambda$ dominated universe. This population of faint quasars at
high redshift would result in a higher incidence of gravitational lensing. The
total luminosity of the quasar population and the total mass tied up in black
hole remnants of quasars is not sensitive to the cosmology. However, for a
$\Lambda$ cosmology this mass is tied up in fewer but more massive black holes.

Consequences of anisotropic cascade radiation in AGN are investigated. The
anisotropic cascades are produced by protons accelerated in a nuclear jet. The
protons are assumed to cool in the UV photon field of an accretion disk by
photo-production of secondary particles. Most cascade photons are produced in
the direction of the accretion disk leading to strong high-energy irradiation
and weak emission of observable MeV photons. Nuclear, turbulent jets rapidly
disrupt and remain radio-faint, so that the scenario could hold the clue to the
understanding of the X-ray spectra of radio-quiet AGN.

We find solutions of Einstein's field equation for topologically stable
strings associated with the breaking of a U(1) symmetry. Strings form in many
GUTs and are expected whenever the homotopy group $\Pi_1(M_0)$ is non-trivial.
The behavior of the fields making up the string is described by the
Euler-Lagrange equations. These fields appear in the energy-momentum tensor so
we must solve simultaneously for the coupled Einstein-scalar-gauge field
equations. Numerical results are obtained using a Taylor-series method. We
obtain a 5-parameter family of solutions and discuss their physical
characteristics. Significant gravitational lensing can occur due to strings
based on this model and are shown for different solutions. Finally, we prove
that the assumption of regularity at the string axis is not necessary by
looking at the physical properties of the string solutions.

We present full modeling of tangent point emission of HI as seen in the 21 cm
transition in the inner Galaxy ($R \simeq 3-8 \kpc$). The model used takes into
account emission from a large path length along the line of sight,
corresponding to an interval ($\Delta R$) of typically $\le 1 \kpc$ in galactic
radius; and is parametrized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z,
the rotation velocity and the velocity dispersion. These parameters are assumed
to be constant over the interval $\Delta R$. This modeling is carried out for
the 21 cm surveys of Weaver \& Williams(1974), Bania \& Lockman (1984), and
Kerr et al. (1986) to measure these parameters. The terminal velocity values
are found to be in good agreement with previous measurements. The velocity
dispersion is constant with radius at the theoretically expected value of $9
\pm 1 \kms$. The Gaussian scale height of the HI layer increases with
Galactocentric radius. The centroid of the layer deviates significantly from
$z=0$. Apart from small local variations, the velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$,
scale height $\sigma_z$ and the centroid $z_0$ show similar variations in the
first and the fourth quadrants. On balancing the turbulent pressure support of
the layer against the disk gravitational potential, we confirm that additional
support is needed for the HI layer. The radial profile of the reduced midplane
mass density is an exponential with a scale length of $3.3 \pm 0.3 \kpc$. This
picture is consistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio of the disk, and
extra pressure support for the HI layer which is constant with radius in the
inner Galaxy.

Spectroscopic observations have been carried out for galaxies in the Milky
Way with the 1.9 m telescope of the South African Astronomical Observatory
(SAAO). The galaxies were selected from a deep optical galaxy search covering
266<l<296 |b|<10deg. This is in the extension of the Hydra and Antlia clusters
and in the approximate direction of the dipole anisotropy in the Cosmic
Microwave Back- ground radiation. The galaxies in the SAAO observing program --
one of the three complementary approaches in mapping the 3D galaxy distribution
in the ZOA -- were selected for high central SB and for even distribution over
the search area. The galaxies have magnitudes in the range 14.5<B_J<17.5. Good
S/N redshifts were determined for 115 galaxies. One spectrum confirmed a PN,
and another object (v=57km\s) most likely is galactic as well. The other 25
spectra have low S/N or were dominated by superimposed foreground stars. We do
find evidence for a continuation of the Hydra/Antlia supercluster across the
ZOA to b=-10, making it one of the larger structures (supercluster?) in the
nearby Universe. However, the prominent overdensity unveiled in the galaxy
search in Vela (l~280, b~+6) does not, contrary to what may be expected from
the 2D distribution, blend with the Hydra and Antlia supercluster (v~3000km/s).
The latter seems concentrated at v~6000km/s$. Whether it is related to the
Great Attractor cannot yet be assessed. Another weaker concentration is found
at v~9700k/ms. A distinct overabundance of redshifts around v~16000km/s is
found, corresponding to that of the adjacent dense Shapley (Alpha) region in
the northern galactic hemisphere andto that of the Horologium superclusters in
the southern galactic hemisphere. This might indicate that these two overdensi-
ties are part of a single massive structure, bisected by the Milky Way.

We present the results of a $BVI$ photometric study of the globular cluster
NGC 6517 using CCD images obtained at the prime focus of the CFHT. From the
resultant color-magnitude diagram, we infer that the cluster is differentially
reddened and develop a method for determining the amplitude of this effect,
which amounts to \( \sim 0.4 \) mag in \( (V-I) \) across our $\sim 4$ arc-min
field. From the corrected $V_0,$ $(V-I)_0$ color-magnitude diagram, we derive
the metallicity and distance modulus of the cluster. Our values for the mean
foreground reddening ($E(B-V) = 1.10 \pm 0.10$) and metallicity (\feh\ = -1.58
$\pm$ 0.05) agree to within uncertainties with previous determinations. Our
apparent distance modulus of 18.3 $\pm$ 0.2, however, is larger than the sole
previous determination. When the distance modulus is corrected for absorption,
assuming that $R_V = 3.8 $ for this line of sight, we find that NGC 6517 is
within 3 kpc of the Galactic center, making it a bulge member. This makes NGC
6517 only the fourth metal poor cluster in the bulge for which an accurate CMD
is available.

We present follow-up observations of a gravitational microlensing candidate
found by the MACHO collaboration in the Galactic bulge. The photometric data
cover a period near the maximum of the event and may be used to construct
complete light curve. The position of the lensed star in the color magnitude
diagram suggests that it is a Galactic bulge star located on the subgiant
branch.

21cm spectral-line and continuum observations of ten compact planetary
nebulae have been made with the Very Large Array. Circumnebular atomic hydrogen
is identified in the planetary nebulae SwSt1, M3-35, and possibly in Hu2-1. The
possibility of an inverse correlation between the optical depth of
circumnebular atomic hydrogen and the linear radius of the ionised nebula is
investigated, but not shown to be statistically significant. Observations of
J=2-1CO emission for 22 planetary nebulae and J=3-2CO emission for 16 planetary
nebulae taken with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope are presented. J=2-1CO
emission is detected in the planetary nebula M1-59, and previous CO detections
in IC5117, M1-16, and NGC6302 are confirmed. J=3-2CO emission is detected in
the planetary nebulae IC 5117, and NGC 6302.

The dissociation and subsequent ionisation of molecular material in a
detached, spherically symmetric stellar wind is modelled as a star evolves from
the post-asymptotic giant branch phase to a planetary nebula (i.e. from a
stellar effective temperature of Teff=6000K to Teff=33000K). The model is
compared to the observed mass and distribution of ionised and atomic hydrogen
in the planetary nebula IC418. It is found that the mass of circumnebular
atomic hydrogen observed in IC418 can easily be produced by the dissociation of
originally molecular material by the ultraviolet radiation of the central star.
However, the observed spatial distribution of the gas is not accurately
recreated by the current model.

As part of a stellar population sampling program, a series of photometric
probes at various field sizes and depths have been obtained in a low extinction
window in the galactic anticentre direction. Very deep CCD frames probe the
most external parts of the disc, providing strong evidence that the galactic
density scale length for the old disc population is rather short (2.5 kpc) and
drops abruptly beyond 5.5-6 kpc. Deeper frames in the I band allow to estimate
photometric distances and confirm the position of the disc edge. A few stars
are found at larger distances. Their number is exactly what we expect if the
thick disc does not have any cutoff. We discuss the implications for the
formation and evolution of the disc, for the star formation threshold, and for
the origin of the thick disc population.

Starting from the assumption that radio jets and accretion disks are
symbiotic features present in radio loud and radio quiet quasars we scale the
bulk power of radio jets with the accretion power by adding mass- and energy
conservation of the whole jet-disk system to the standard Blandford \& K\"onigl
theory for compact radio cores. The model depends on only few parameters and
can be constrained by observations. Thus we are able to show that radio and
X-ray fluxes (SSC emission) of cores and lobes and typical dimensions of radio
loud quasars are consistent with a jet being produced in the central engine. We
present a synthetic broadband spectrum from radio to X-ray for a jet-disk
system. The only way to explain the high efficiency of radio loud objects is to
postulate that these objects consist of `maximal jets' with `total
equipartition' where the magnetic energy flow of the jet is comparable to the
kinetic jet power and the total jet power is a large fraction of the disk
power. As the number of electrons is limited by the accretion flow, this is
only possible when the minimum Lorentz factor of the electron distribution is
$\gamma_{\rm e,min}\ga100$ ($E\ga 50 {\rm MeV}$) or/and a large number of pairs
are present. Such an electron/positron population would be a necessary
consequence of hadronic interactions and may lead to some interesting effects
in the low frequency self-absorbed spectrum. Emission from radio weak quasars
can be explained with an initially identical jet. The difference between radio
loud and radio weak could be due to a different efficiency in accelerating
relativistic electrons on the sub-parsec scale. Finally we demonstrate that in
order to appease the ravenous hunger of radio loud jets its production must be
somehow linked to the dissipation process in the inner part of the disk.

We have compared the Tenerife data with the {\it COBE} DMR two-year data in
the declination +40\deg region of the sky observed by the Tenerife experiment.
Using the Galactic plane signal at $\sim 30$ GHz, we show that the two data
sets are cross-calibrated to within 5%. The high Galactic latitude data were
investigated for the presence of common structures with the properties of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. The most prominent feature in
the Tenerife data ($\Delta T \sim 80\mu$K) is evident in both the 53 and 90 GHz
DMR maps and has the Planckian spectrum expected for CMB anisotropy. The
cross-correlation function of the Tenerife and DMR scans is indicative of
common structure and at zero lag has the value $C(0)^{1/2}=34^{+13}_{-15}\:
\mu$K. The combination of the spatial and spectral information from the two
data sets is consistent with the presence of cosmic microwave background
anisotropies common to both. The probability that noise could produce the
observed agreement is less than 5%.

We consider the effects of a massive, unstable neutrino on the evolution of
large--scale structure and anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background.
Comparison with large--scale structure data allows us to rule out a wide range
of masses and lifetimes for such neutrinos. We also define a range of masses
and lifetimes which delay matter--radiation equality and improve the agreement
with the data of Cold Dark Matter models with critical density.

We quantitatively determine the effect and the uncertainty on solar neutrino
production arising from the screening process. We present predictions for the
solar neutrino fluxes and signals obtained with different screening models
available in the literature and by using our stellar evolution code. We explain
these numerical results in terms of simple laws relating the screening factors
with the neutrino fluxes. Futhermore we explore a wider range of models for
screening, obtained from the Mitler model by introducing and varying two
phenomenological parameters, taking into account effects not included in the
Mitler prescription. Screening implies, with respect to a no-screening case, a
central temperat reduction of 0.5%, a 2% (8%) increase of Beryllium
(Boron)-neutrino flux and a 2% (12%) increase of the Gallium (Chlorine) signal.
We also find that uncertainties due to the screening effect ar at the level of
1% for the predicted Beryllium-neutrino flux and Gallium signal, not exceeding
3% for the Boron-neutrino flux and the Chlorine signal.

We investigate the correlation between the accretion disk (UV) luminosity and
the radio core emission of a quasar sample. In a radio/$L_{\rm disk}$ plot we
find the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars
(CDQ), lobe dominated quasars (LDQ), radio-intermediate quasars (RIQ) and radio
weak quasars. In general the radio core emission scales with the disk
luminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. This shows that radio and UV
emission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loud
and radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. We investigate the
possibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission in
radio loud and radio weak quasars. Comparing our data with a simple jet
emission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation in
a coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry a
total power $Q_{\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity
$L_{\rm disk}$. For the electron population one is forced to postulate an
efficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electrons
with a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 MeV -- secondary pair
production in hadronic cascades could be such a process. The bulk Lorentz
factor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\la\gamma_{\rm j}\la10$)).
The radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the same
parameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, as
suggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. There is evidence that RIQ are the
relativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. We can estimate
the hidden disk luminosity of FR II galaxies and find that this is consistent
with FRII being misdirected quasars.

We compare the ultra-violet, optical, and far-infrared emission for a sample
of 135 spiral galaxies in order to address the widely debated problem
concerning the opacity of spiral disks. We find that the re-radiation of the
dust, estimated from the far-infrared emission, is on average only 31$\pm 1$
percent of the bolometric luminosity of a spiral galaxy, indicating that less
than one third of the stellar radiation is absorbed and then re-radiated by
dust in a spiral disk. Applying a radiation transfer model which assumes a
`Sandwich' configuration for the spiral disk, and fully takes into account the
effect of scattering, we find for our sample a median of the face-on blue
(4400{\AA}) optical depth $\rm \tau_B=0.49$ and the mean $\rm <\tau_B> =0.60\pm
0.04$, indicating that most spiral galaxies in our sample are {\it not} opaque
for blue light ($\rm \tau_B <1$).

I review two observational programs which, together, promise to unravel the
detailed astrophysical evolution of normal field galaxies over the last 5-7
Gyr. Systematic ground-based spectroscopy of faint galaxies have revealed an
increasing faint end slope for the luminosity function with redshift. The trend
is strongest for galaxies undergoing intense star-formation. Deep images taken
with the repaired HST can be used to count galaxies as a function of
morphological type. Regular `Hubble sequence' galaxies follow the no-evolution
prediction, but irregular/peculiar sources have a steeper count slope and
provide the excess population. Although the overlap between the spectral and
HST samples is currently small, plans to merge similar datasets should reveal
the physical explanation for the demise of star formation in faint blue
galaxies since $z\simeq$0.5-1.

We consider a variant of Hybrid Inflation, where inflation is driven by two
interacting scalar fields, one of which has a `Mexican hat' potential and the
other a quartic potential. Given the appropriate initial conditions one of the
fields can be trapped in a false vacuum state, supported by couplings to the
other field. The energy of this vacuum can be used to drive inflation, which
ends when the vacuum decays to one of its true minima. Depending on parameters,
it is possible for inflation to proceed via two separate epochs, with the
potential temporarily steepening sufficiently to suspend inflation. We use
numerical simulations to analyse the possibilities, and emphasise the
shortcomings of the slow-roll approximation for analysing this scenario. We
also calculate the density perturbations produced, which can have a spectral
index greater than one.

In a recent study (Maoz and Grindlay 1995) we have found that a number of
previously recognized anomalies in the diffuse x-ray background at soft
energies (\sim 0.5-2 keV) can be understood if about 20-30% of the diffuse flux
arises from a population of low luminosity sources in a thick disk or flattened
halo distribution in the Galaxy. Here we summarize our results and review the
arguments that these objects are not accreting neutron stars or black holes but
rather white dwarfs (i.e. CVs) which may have been produced in a primordial
population of disrupted globular clusters.

We link the lack of FR I type structure among quasars to the void of radio
loud quasars below a critical disk luminosity of ~10^46 erg/sec in the PG
sample. We argue that the opening angle of the obscuring torus in radio loud
quasars depends on the power of the central engine, approaching the jet's
beaming angle near the FR I/FR II break. Consequently, low power radio quasars
would either be classified as radio galaxies (FR I) or strongly core-boosted
(BL Lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitional
population would be expected for FR I sources. A closing torus with decreasing
power would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles but
would also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jet
stream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet's
deceleration to form a FR I source. Above a critical luminosity, the wider
torus allows for FR II type jets and visibility of the nuclear optical
emission, characteristic of radio loud quasars. Apparently, at the same engine
power the torus opening in radio weak quasars and Seyferts is substantially
wider than in radio loud quasars, probably because of different dynamics or
feeding mechanisms in disk and elliptical galaxies. This provides a clue for
the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars if the the jet/torus
interaction leads to injection of relativistic e^+/- pairs via p-p collisions.
Strong jet/torus interaction may lead to a substantial injection of secondary
pairs and collimation in radio loud quasars, while weak interaction in radio
weak quasars leads neither to pair injection nor to good collimation.

We discuss the chemical evolution of metal poor galaxies and conclude that
their oxygen deficiency is not due to: the production of black holes by massive
stars or a varying slope of the Initial Mass Function, IMF, at the high-mass
end. A varying IMF at the low-mass end alone or in combination with: (a) an
outflow of oxygen-rich material, (b) an outflow of well-mixed material, and (c)
the presence of dark matter that does not participate in the chemical evolution
process, is needed to explain their oxygen deficiency. Outflow of material rich
in oxygen helps to account for the large helium to oxygen mass ratio values
derived from these objects, but it works against explaining the carbon to
oxygen mass ratio and the heavy elements minus carbon and oxygen to oxygen mass
ratio values.

The radio observations are based on dual frequency Mark--III VLBI data from
1979 until the end of 1993. Currently 436 sources define the celestial inertial
frame. A comparison to the JPL94R01 catalog is made. Position vs. time plots of
selected sources show significant apparent non linear proper motions. The
status of the project and recent results from optical observations are
presented.

We report on observations performed at 1.25 $mm$ of a southern galaxy sample,
selected from the IRAS PSC and complete to $S_{60}=2 Jy$. We detected 18
sources and set significant limits on 10 further objects. We use these data to
discuss the spatial distribution of cold dust, the broad-band far-IR/mm
spectra, the overall amount of dust, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, the dust
optical depth, and the overall extinction, for such a representative galaxy
sample. These results are also supported by a successful comparison with values
inferred for the Galaxy. Because of the favourable observational setup,
selection wavelength and completeness, we believe these data provide an
unbiased view of dust properties in spiral galaxies.

A conventional explanation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation is in terms of the Doppler effect: our galaxy is
moving with respect to CMB frame with $ \sim 600 ~ km ~ s^{-1} $. However, as
the deep redshift surveys fail to reveal a convergence of the large scale flow
to zero at distances as large as $ d \sim H^{-1} 15,000 ~ km ~ s^{-1} $ (Lauer
& Postman, 1994), the uniqueness of the conventional interpretation has to be
investigated. A possible alternative might be a cosmological entropy gradient,
as suggested by Paczy\'nski & Piran (1990). We find that contrary to that
suggestion a quadrupole anisotropy is generically of the same order of
magnitude as the dipole anisotropy (or larger) not only for adiabatic but also
for iso-curvature initial perturbations. Hence, the observed dipole cannot be
explained with a very large scale perturbation which was initially
iso-curvature.

We present a 100 yr optical lightcurve of the recently discovered supersoft
X-ray source RX~J0019.8+2156 as deduced from photographic plates of Harvard and
Sonneberg Observatory. Apart from the periodic orbital variations two different
timescales of optical variability are discovered. The timescales and amplitudes
of this variability are discussed in the framework of the steady nuclear
burning model.

We review recent gravitational microlensing results from the EROS, MACHO, and
OGLE collaborations, and present some details of the very latest MACHO results
toward the Galactic Bulge. The MACHO collaboration has now discovered in excess
of 40 microlensing events toward the Galactic Bulge during the 1993 observing
season. A preliminary analysis of this data suggests a much higher microlensing
optical depth than predicted by standard galactic models suggesting that these
models will have to be revised. This may have important implications for the
structure of the Galaxy and its dark halo. Also shown are MACHO data of the
first microlensing event ever detected substantially before peak amplification,
the first detection of parallax effects in a microlensing event, and the first
caustic crossing to be resolved in a microlensing event.

To distinguish between the different models proposed to understand the excess
of faint field counts over the predictions from non-evolving models, a number
of redshift surveys have been undertaken. The answer has not arrived yet due to
the high rate of incompleteness achieved. Un-identified galaxies have been
shown to be bluer than identified ones. In this paper, it is argued that some
of these galaxies could be "quiescent" dwarfs, still quite blue, but with
featureless spectra.

We present a determination of the thick disk iron abundance distribution
obtained from an in situ sample of F/G stars. These stars are faint, $15 \simlt
V \simlt 18$, selected on the basis of color, being a subset of the larger
survey of Gilmore and Wyse designed to determine the properties of the stellar
populations several kiloparsecs from the Sun. The fields studied in the present
paper probe the iron abundance distribution of the stellar populations of the
Galaxy at 500--3000pc above the plane, at the solar Galactocentric distance.

We report the results of radio flux-monitoring and high resolution
observations at 3.6 cm with the VLA, of the central condensation in G10.0-0.3,
the radio nebula surrounding the soft gamma ray repeater (SGR) 1806-20. The
quiescent X-ray source AX1805.7-2025 is coincident with the radio core
suggesting that G10.0-0.3 is a plerionic supernova remnant. The monitoring
experiment was performed in 10 epochs spread over five months, starting just
before the latest reactivation of SGR 1806-20 in gamma-rays. There is no
apparent increase in the radio flux density from the central region of
G10.0-0.3 on timescales of days to months following the gamma-ray bursts. At a
resolution of 1 arcsec the peak region of G10.0-0.3 is seen to consist of a
compact source with diffuse, one-sided emission, reminiscent of core-jet
geometry seen in AGNs and some accreting Galactic binaries. By analogy with
these latter sources, we argue that the SGR 1806-20 is coincident with the core
component. If so, this is the first arcsecond localization of a high energy
transient. The lack of radio variability and the low brightness temperature of
the central component distinguish SGR 1806-20 from other accreting binaries.
The structure of the high resolution radio image also does not particularly
resemble that seen in the vicinity of young pulsars. Thus there is no
compelling observational evidence for either of the two models discussed for
SGRs, the pulsar model or the accreting binary model.

We present here the results of cross-correlating the X-ray background
measured by Ginga in the 2-10 keV band with several catalogues of extragalactic
objects. Positive signals with an amplitude of a few per cent have been found
for some catalogues implying that some fraction of the X-ray background is
produced either by the class of catalogued sources or by other classes
spatially related to them. Detailed X-ray background simulations have been used
to assess the significance of the results and, for the first time, the full
angular shape of the cross-correlation. The inferred X-ray volume emissivity in
the local Universe, j_0, has been estimated for two galaxy catalogues (UGC and
IRAS) for which the cross-correlation is highly significant. We obtain j_0=
(0.74 +/- 0.07) for UGC and j_0= (1.15 +/- 0.10) for IRAS, in units of 1.E39 h
erg/s/Mpc3. Extrapolating this result back to z~1-4 leads to the conclusion
that <~10-30 per cent of the X-ray background could be produced by a
non-evolving population of galaxies. These values are shown to be consistent
with upper limits on the Auto Correlation Function derived here.

We have observed with ROSAT six blazars from the sample of 31 polarized
objects constructed by Impey and Tapia (1988). Results of the spectral analysis
in the ROSAT band of three objects, PKS 0301-243, PKS 1055+018 and PG 1424+240
are presented here and compared with the three previously published objects.
Using a simple power law model with free absorption a wide range of spectral
slopes is found. Objects with emission lines have flatter X-ray spectra than
lineless objects. Indication of spectral curvature within the X-ray band is
found in the sense of a concavity (soft excess) for the flattest spectrum and a
convexity (soft deficiency) for the steepest one. The X-ray spectral shape is
discussed in relation to the overall energy distribution for the six objects.
The results are compared with other samples of blazars. The X-ray spectral
index, alpha_X, is found to be anticorrelated with the broad band spectral
index alpha_RO and with bolometric luminosity and redshift. It is suggested
that the different spectra of quasar-like and BL Lac-like blazars represent
extremes in a continuous distribution rather than two distinct populations.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a unique probe of cosmological
parameters and conditions. There is a connection between anisotropy in the CMB
and the topology of the Universe. Adopting a universe with the topology of a
3-Torus, or a universe where only harmonics of the fundamental mode are
allowed, and using 2-years of COBE/DMR data, we obtain constraints on the
topology of the Universe. Previous work constrained the topology using the
slope information and the correlation function of the CMB. We obtain more
accurate results by using all multipole moments, avoiding approximations by
computing their full covariance matrix. We obtain the best fit for a cubic
toroidal universe of scale 7200h^{-1} Mpc for n=1. The data set a lower limit
on the cell size of 4320h^{-1} Mpc at 95% confidence and 5880h^{-1} Mpc at 68%
confidence. These results show that the most probable cell size would be around
1.2 times larger than the horizon scale, implying that the 3-Torus topology is
no longer an interesting cosmological model.

We have obtained a 12.5 ksec image of the Hercules Cluster, A2151, with the
{\it ROSAT} PSPC. Comparison of the optical and X-ray data suggest the presence
of at least three distinct subclusters in A2151. The brightest X-ray emission
coincides with the highest-density peak in the galaxy distribution, and is
bimodal. The northern subclump, distinct in position and velocity, has {\it no}
detectable X-ray gas. The eastern subclump, apparent in the optical contour
map, is indistinguishable from the main clump in velocity space but is clearly
visible in the X-ray image. X-ray spectra derived from the central peak of
emission yield a best-fit temperature of 1.6 keV. The emission coincident with
the eastern clump of galaxies is cooler, 0.8 keV, and is outside the 90\%
confidence intervals of the central peak temperature. We suggest that the
eastern and central subclusters have recently undergone a merger event. The
lack of X-ray emission to the north suggests that those galaxies do not form a
physically-distinct structure (i.e. they are not located within a distinct
gravitational potential), but rather that they are falling into the cluster
core along the filament defined by the Hercules Supercluster.

More than a dozen papers analyzing the COBE data have now appeared. We review
the different techniques and compare them to a ``brute force" likelihood
analysis where we invert the full 4038 x 4038 Galaxy-cut pixel covariance
matrix. This method is optimal in the sense of producing minimal error bars,
and is a useful reference point for comparing other analysis techniques. Our
maximum-likelihood estimate of the spectral index and normalization are n=1.15
(0.95) and Q=18.2 (21.3) micro-Kelvin including (excluding) the quadrupole.
Marginalizing over the normalization C_9, we obtain n=1.10 +/- 0.29 (n=0.90 +/-
0.32). When we compare these results with those of the various techniques that
involve a linear ``compression'' of the data, we find that the latter are all
consistent with the brute-force analysis and have error bars that are nearly as
small as the minimal error bars. We therefore conclude that the data
compressions involved in these techniques do indeed retain most of the useful
cosmological information.

The soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) 1806$-$20 is associated with the
center-brightened non-thermal nebula G~10.0$-$0.3, thought to be a plerion. As
in other plerions, a steady \Xray\ source, AX~1805.7$-$2025, has been detected
coincident with the peak of the nebular radio emission. Vasisht et al.\ have
shown that the radio peak has a core-jet appearance, and argue that the core
marks the true position of the SGR. At optical wavelengths, we detect three
objects in the vicinity of the radio core. Only for the star closest to the
core, barely visible in the optical but bright in the infrared ($K=8.4\,$mag.),
the reddening is consistent with the high extinction ($A_V\simeq30\,$mag.) that
has been inferred for AX~1805.7$-$2025. From the absence of CO band absorption,
we infer that the spectral type of this star is earlier than late~G/early~K.
The large extinction probably arises in a molecular cloud located at a distance
of 6$\,$kpc, which means that the star, just like AX~1805.7$-$2025, is in or
behind this cloud. This implies that the star is a supergiant. Since
supergiants are rare, a chance coincidence with the compact radio core is very
unlikely. To our knowledge, there are only three other examples of luminous
stars embedded in non-thermal radio nebulae, SS~433, \mbox{Cir X-1} and
G~70.7+1.2. Given this and the low coincidence probability, we suggest that the
bright star is physically associated with SGR~1806$-$20, making it the first
stellar identification of a high-energy transient.

We discuss some implications of the current round of galactic dark matter
searches for galactic rotation curve systematics and dynamics, and show that
these new data do not invalidate the conformal gravity program of Mannheim and
Kazanas which has been advanced as a candidate alternative to both the standard
second order Newton-Einstein theory and the need for dark matter.

We present maps at $20''$ resolution of the molecular emission around 18
evolved stars (14~asymptotic giant branch stars, one supergiant, two
proto-planetary nebulae and one planetary nebula), mostly in the $^{12}$CO(3-2)
line. Almost all molecular envelopes appear to be at least marginally resolved
at this resolution. A substantial fraction of the molecular envelopes show
clear deviations from spherical symmetry in the form of elliptical or bipolar
envelopes. This indicates that there is a need to implement non-spherical mass
loss in current scenarios of the late stages of stellar evolution, in
particular on the asymptotic giant branch.

If compact baryonic objects contribute significantly to the dark matter in
our Galaxy, their mass function will present vital clues for galaxy formation
theories and star formation processes in the early Universe. Here we discuss
what one might expect to learn about the mass function of Galactic dark matter
from microlensing and from direct searches in the infrared and optical
wavebands. Current microlensing results from the \eros\/ collaboration already
constrain halo mass functions which extend below $10^{-4}~\sm$, whilst recent
\hst\/ observations place strong constraints on disc and halo dark matter mass
functions extending above $0.1~\sm$. Infrared observations should either detect
or constrain objects larger than $0.01~\sm$ in the near future. Objects below
$0.01~\sm$ should be detectable through microlensing, although the prospects of
determining their mass function depend critically on a number of factors.

The cocoons surrounding powerful radio sources can be extensive if the jet
that feeds the cocoon is light and supersonic. They have been shown to remain
overpressured with respect to the ambient medium for most of the life time of
the sources. The observed lobes of the radio sources form parts of these
extensive cocoons. We show that observations of the lobes of giant radio
sources allow one to estimate the {\it density} of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) in which the lobes are embedded. We estimate the IGM density to be of the
order of a few percent of the closure density of the universe. We further
calculate the radio power of the overpressured cocoon as a function of time and
the ambient density.

Knowledge of the shape of dark matter halos is critical to our understanding
of galaxy formation, dynamics, and of the nature of dark matter itself. Polar
ring galaxies (PRGs) --- early-type galaxies defined by their outer rings of
gas, dust and stars on orbits nearly perpendicular to those of the central host
--- provide a rare probe of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio $ (q_{\rho} =
c/a)$ of dark halos. We present a Fabry-Perot velocity field for the H$\alpha$
gas in the kinematically-confirmed PRG \gal. By comparing ring orbits evolved
in a generalized mass model to the observed ring velocity field and morphology
of \gal, we conclude that $q_\rho \sim 0.5$ and rule out a spherical geometry.

We present here the results of a statistical search for cluster alignments
using the Edinburgh/Milano cluster redshift survey. This survey is a unique
cluster database which has been objectively constructed to help minimise the
systematic biases associated with previous optical cluster catalogues. We find
some evidence for cluster alignments out to spatial separations of $<10\mpc$,
however, it is not statistically significant. On larger scales, we find no
evidence, statistically significant or not, for cluster alignments. These
results are in most disagreement with the recent observations of West and
Plionis; both of whom see significant cluster alignments out to $\simeq30\mpc$
and beyond in the Abell \& Lick catalogues of clusters. Our findings are
consistent with other searches for cluster alignments that do not involve these
catalogues.

The main sequence turnoff luminosity is the best stellar `clock' which can be
used to determine the absolute ages of globular clusters. This is due to the
fact that it is generally assumed that the luminosity and lifetimes of main
sequence globular cluster stars are independent of the properties of stellar
convection and atmospheres, two areas of stellar evolution which are poorly
understood. Several possible sources of error in this stellar clock are
discussed, and isochrones are constructed using a variety of different physical
assumptions. The mean age of the oldest globular clusters are determined from
these isochrones and it is found that the uncertainties in the input physics
can lead to changes in the derived age of $\pm 15\%$. Surprisingly the largest
source of error is the mixing length theory of convection. It is well known
that uncertainties in the distance scale and chemical composition of globular
cluster stars lead to changes of order $\sim 22\%$ in the determination of
absolute ages. Combining the various sources of error, the absolute age of the
oldest globular clusters are found to lie in the range 11 --- 21 Gyr. This is
meant to be a total theoretical range. For the standard inflationary model
($\Omega = 1, \Lambda = 0$), a minimum age of the universe of 11 Gyr requires
$H_o \la 60~\kmsmpc$.

We present UBR and H$\alpha$ imaging of NGC 1620, a highly inclined spiral
galaxy that contains a large scale, arc-like feature of radius 3 kpc in its
outer disk at a distance of $\sim$ 11 kpc from the center. What is unusual
about this arc-like feature is its stellar nature and the presence of a
luminous star cluster at its center. The arc is fragmented into HII region
complexes and OB star clusters and shows two kinks in optical continuum light.
It spans an angle of 220$^{\circ}$ on our U image and a full, though
fragmented, circle on an unsharp masked R image. It is centered on a young star
cluster that is the most luminous clump in blue optical continuum light besides
the nucleus of the galaxy. This central star cluster has UBR colors and a
surface brightness similar to those of other HII regions, but is a relatively
weak H$\alpha$ emitter. It consists of at least three unresolved condensations
in optical continuum light. Its location at the center of the arc and its
prominence within the galaxy suggests that it has been the site of several
generations of supernova explosions that swept up the surrounding gas into a
supershell. When it attained a radius of $0.5-1$ kpc, this shell became
gravitationally unstable and formed the stars which now delineate the arc. The
constraints imposed by the survival of the expanding arc against random stellar
motions and the age of the stars in the arc yield a required energy input by a
minimum of 400 and a maximum of 6500 supernovae. In this scenario the asymmetry
in surface brightness of the arc reflects the radial gradient of the gas
density in the disk of NGC 1620, while the kinks reflect inhomogeneities in the
original gas distribution with respect to the central star cluster. The
supernova superbubble formed at least $5 \times 10^7$ yr ago so that, unless

We have measured our Galaxy's motion relative to distant galaxies in which
type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) have been observed. The effective recession velocity
of this sample is 7000 km s$^{-1}$, which approaches the depth of the survey of
brightest cluster galaxies by Lauer and Postman (1994). We use the Light Curve
Shape (LCS) method for deriving distances to SN Ia, providing relative distance
estimates to individual supernovae with a precision of $\sim$ 5\% (Riess,
Press, \& Kirshner 1995). Analyzing the distribution on the sky of velocity
residuals from a pure Hubble flow for 13 recent SN Ia drawn primarily from the
Cal\'{a}n/Tololo survey (Hamuy 1993a, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, Maza et al. 1994), we
find the best solution for the motion of the Local Group in this frame is 600
$\pm 350$ km s$^{-1}$ in the direction b=260$\deg$ {\it l}=+54$\deg$ with a 1
$\sigma$ error ellipse that measures 90$\deg$ by 25$\deg$. This solution is
consistent with the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as
determined by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) measurement of the dipole
temperature anisotropy (Smoot et al. 1992). It is inconsistent with the
velocity observed by Lauer and Postman.

We present results from 2 observations of the CMB performed from the South
Pole during the 93-94 austral summer. Each observation employed a 3$^{\circ}$
peak to peak sinusoidal, single difference chop and consisted of a
$20^{\circ}\times 1^{\circ}$ strip on the sky near our SP91 observations. The
first observation used a Q-band receiver which operates in 3 bands between 38
and 45 GHz with a $1^{\circ}$ to $1_{\cdot}^{\circ }15$ FWHM beam. The second
observation overlapped the first observation and used a Ka-band receiver which
operates in 4 bands between 26 and 36 GHz with a $1_{\cdot}^{\circ}25$ to
$1_{\cdot}^{\circ}7$ FWHM beam. Significant correlated structure is observed in
all bands for each observation. The spectrum of the structure is consistent
with a CMB spectrum; however, the data do not discriminate against flat or
inverted spectrum point sources. The root mean square amplitude ($\pm 1\sigma$)
of the combined (Ka+Q) data is $\Delta T_{rms}=42.0_{-6.8}^{+15.8}$ $\mu$K in a
band of multipoles between $\ell=68^{+38}_{-32}$. A band power estimate of the
CMB power spectrum, $C_\ell$, gives $\left\langle \frac{C_\ell \ell
(\ell+1)}{2\pi}\right\rangle_B= 1.77_{-0.54}^{+1.58}\times 10^{-10}$. The band
power estimates for the seperate Ka and Q-band results are larger than but
consistent with the band power estimate of the combined Ka-band SP91 results.

The Cosmic Background Radiation gives us one of the few probes into the
density perturbations in the early universe that should later lead to the
formation of structure we now observe. Recent advances in degree scale
anisotropy measurements have allowed us to begin critically testing
cosmological models. Combined with the larger scale measurements from COBE we
are now able to directly compare data and theory. These measurements promise
future progress in understanding structure formation. Because of the extreme
sensitivities needed (1-10 ppm) and the difficulties of foreground sources,
these measurements require not only technological advances in detector and
measurement techniques, but multi spectral measurements and careful attention
to low level systematic errors. This field is advancing rapidly and is in a
true discovery mode. Our own group has been involved in a series of eleven
experiments over the last six years using the ACME (Advanced Cosmic Microwave
Explorer) payload which has made measurements at angular scales from 0.3 to 3
degrees and over a wavelength range from 1 to 10 mm. The recent data from these
and other measurements will be reviewed as well as some of the challenges and
potential involved in these and future measurements.

We compute the variation of the beaming fraction with the efficiency of high
energy gamma-ray production in the outer gap pulsar model of Romani and
Yadigaroglu. This allows us to correct the fluxes observed for pulsars in the
EGRET band and to derive a simple estimate of the variation of efficiency with
age. Integration of this model over the population of young neutron stars gives
the expected number of gamma-ray pulsars along with their distributions in age
and distance. This model also shows that many of the unidentified EGRET plane
sources should be pulsars, and predicts the gamma-ray fluxes of known radio
pulsars. The contribution of unresolved pulsars to the background flux in the
EGRET band is found to be about 5 %. For an animation of our pulsar model see
http://geminga.stanford.edu/users/ion/home.html .

We systematically investigate the effects of high supernova kick velocities
on the orbital parameters of post-supernova neutron-star binaries. Using Monte-
Carlo simulations, we determine the post-supernova distributions of orbital
parameters for progeneitors of HMXBs and LMXBs. With the recent distribution of
pulsar birth velocities by Lyne & Lorimer (1994), only about 27% of massive
systems remain bound after the supernova, of which about 26% immediately
experience dynamical mass transfer and possibly merge to become Thorne-Zytkow
objects. The correlations between various orbital parameters can be compared
with observational samples to yield information about supernova kick velocities
and pre-supernova orbital-period distributions. After the supernova, the spins
of most stars in massive systems have large inclinations with respect to their
orbital axes, and a significant fraction of systems (about 20%) contain stars
with retrograde spins. In the case of low-mass companions, we find that about
19% of systems remain bound after the supernova, of which about 57% experience
immediate dynamical mass transfer. There is a tight correlation between the
eccentricity and the post-supernova orbital period in LMXB progeneitors. All
LMXBs with post-supernova periods longer than a few days initially have large
eccentricities (e.g. Cir X-1 is discussed in this context). We use the results
of these calculations to simulate the sky distributions of HMXBs and LMXBs. The
simulated distributions agree with observed samples. Most importantly, the
distribution of Galactic LMXBs is consistent with an ordinary Galactic disk
population which has been widened because of large supernova kicks and does not
require a special population of progenitors.

We investigate the feasibility of carrying out likelihood analysis on the
velocities of galaxy clusters to determine power spectrum parameters. Using
N-body simulations of cosmological density fields we show that the velocity
field traced by clusters is highly non-linear on small scales (r < 10 h^-1
Mpc), mostly due to strong infall into superclusters. The transverse and line
of sight velocity correlation functions relevant to likelihood analysis deviate
significantly from the linear theory values. Unfortunately, the sparseness of
cluster samples means that they are not amenable to any rigorous smoothing
procedure to rectify this. We are forced instead to remove close pairs of
clusters which would contribute disproportionately to the likelihood. This
reduces the size still further of the small samples of observed clusters
available to us, forcing us into the conclusion that using straightfoward
linear theory covariance analysis on clusters is unpromising. Nevertheless we
apply the technique to two sets of observational data and find marginal
evidence for more power in the mass density field than standard CDM. The
normalisation is consistent with \Omega^{0.6}\sigma_{8} \sim 0.7 for both data
sets, within the (large) errors.

Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and density fluctuations are
calculated for flat cold dark matter (CDM) models with a wide range of
parameters, i.e., $\Omega_0, h$ and $\Omega_B$ for both standard recombination
and various epochs of reionization. Tables of the power spectrum of CMB
anisotropies in the form of $C_\ell$'s as a function of $\ell$ are presented.
Although the Harrison-Zeldovich initial spectrum is assumed in these tables, we
present simple approximations for obtaining the $C_\ell$'s corresponding to a
tilted spectrum from those with a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. The $\sigma_8$
values are obtained for the matter density spectrum, with $\sigma(10^\circ)$,
fixed $Q_{rms-PS}$ and COBE DMR 2 year normalizations. Simple modifications of
the fitting formula of the density transfer function which are applicable for
models with high baryon density are given. By using both numerical results and
these fitting formulae, we calculate the relation between $\sigma_8$ and
$Q_{rms-PS}$, and find good agreement. Velocity fields are also calculated.

The infrared through millimetre light curve of 3C 279 is investigated for the
period of 1986 until mid-1994, during which time several flares were observed.
A quiescent spectrum (identified with emission from an underlying jet) is
presented. Both the near-IR and 375-150 GHz regimes are shown to be well
described by power laws, with no evidence for any thermal contribution in the
IR. Successful isolation of the flaring component by subtraction of a base
level is found to be difficult. Dividing each individual flare into two regimes
corresponding to before and after maximum flux, we find strong linear
correlations between log 90 GHz flux and 22-90 GHz spectral slope. Furthermore,
the gradient of the linear correlation steepens as the flare decays after
maximum. This trend is observed for several successive flares, and can be
successfully explained in terms of evolution of the flare according to the the
shocked-jet model of Marscher & Gear (1985).

Quantitative morphological classification of galaxies is important for
understanding the origin of type frequency and correlations with environment.
But galaxy morphological classification is still mainly done visually by
dedicated individuals, in the spirit of Hubble's original scheme, and its
modifications. The rapid increase in data on galaxy images at low and high
redshift calls for re-examination of the classification schemes and for new
automatic methods. Here we show results from the first systematic comparison of
the dispersion among human experts classifying a uniformly selected sample of
over 800 digitised galaxy images. These galaxy images were then classified by
six of the authors independently. The human classifications are compared with
each other, and with an automatic classification by Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN). It is shown that the ANNs can replicate the classification by a human
expert to the same degree of agreement as that between two human experts.

The optical properties of the ice at the geographical South Pole have been
investigated at depths between 0.8 and 1 kilometers. The absorption and
scattering lengths of visible light ($\sim$515 nm) have been measured {\it in
situ } using the laser calibration setup of the AMANDA neutrino detector. The
ice is intrinsically extremely transparent. The measured absorption length is
59 $\pm$ 3 meters, comparable with the quality of the ultra-pure water used in
the IMB and Kamiokande proton-decay and neutrino experiments and more than two
times longer than the best value reported for laboratory ice. Due to a residual
density of air bubbles at these depths, the trajectories of photons in the
medium are randomized. Assuming bubbles are smooth and spherical, the average
distance between collisions at 1 km depth is about 25 cm. The measured inverse
scattering length on bubbles decreases linearly with increasing depth in the
volume of ice investigated.

The issue of the X-ray to optical luminosity relationship ($L_o-L_x$) is
addressed for both optically and X-ray selected quasar samples. We have applied
a generalized regression algorithm for the case of samples involving censored
data, with errors on both the dependent and the independent variable. Contrary
to some previous results, we find that such relationship is consistent with
being a linear one ($L_x\propto L_o$). We argue that previous reports of
non-linear relationships (i.e. $L_x\propto L_o^e$ with $e < 1$) are due to the
neglect of the influence of the photometric errors, the precise knowledge of
which strongly influences the reliability of the results. Further progresses in
the determination of the $L_o-L_x$ relationship can be achieved with ROSAT
observations of the new generation of large bright quasar surveys.

An investigation is made of disk accretion of matter onto a rotating star
with an aligned dipole magnetic field. A new aspect of this work is that when
the angular velocity of the star and disk differ substantially we argue that
the $\bf B$ field linking the star and disk rapidly inflates to give regions of
open field lines extending from the polar caps of the star and from the disk.
The open field line region of the disk leads to the possibility of magnetically
driven outflows. An analysis is made of the outflows and their back affect on
the disk structure assuming an ``$\ap$" turbulent viscosity model for the disk
and a magnetic diffusivity comparable to this viscosity. The outflows are found
to extend over a range of radial distances inward to a distance close to
$r_{to}$, which is the distance of the maximum of the angular rotation rate of
the disk. We find that $r_{to}$ depends on the star's magnetic moment, the
accretion rate, and the disk's magnetic diffusivity. The outflow regime is
accompanied in general by a spin-up of the rotation rate of the star. When
$r_{to}$ exceeds the star's corotation radius $r_{cr} = (GM/\om_*^2)^{1\ov 3}$,
we argue that outflow solutions do not occur, but instead that ``magnetic
braking" of the star by the disk due to field-line twisting occurs in the
vicinity of $r_{cr}$. The magnetic braking solutions can give spin-up or
spin-down (or no spin change) of the star depending mainly on the star's
magnetic moment and the mass accretion rate. For a system with $r_{to}$
comparable to $r_{cr}$, bimodal behavior is possible where extraneous
perturbations cause the system to flip between spin-up and spin-down.

We study the effects of negative spatial curvature on the statistics of
inhomogeneities in open cosmological models. In particular we examine the
suppression of large-separation correlations in density and gravitational
potential fluctuations and the resulting suppression of large-angle
correlations in the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation. We obtain
an expression which gives the {\it minimum} amount of suppression of
correlations for any statistical distribution described by a ``power
spectrum''. This minimum suppression requires that the correlations fall off
exponentially above the curvature scale. To the extent that the observed
correlations in the temperature anisotropy extend to large angular scales, one
can set a lower bound to the radius of curvature and hence on $\Omega_0$.

We study steady, radial gas outflows from galaxies in an effort to understand
the way tenuous and hot gas is transported to large distances away from
galaxies. In particular, we obtain solutions for outflow problems, and study
the outflow topology, effects of the galaxy mass, the size of outflow regions,
the efficiency of radiative cooling, and the fate of the cooled gas. Under
general power-law forms for the cooling function and the gravitational field of
galaxies, we show that the outflow solutions are determined by the
two-parameter initial conditions. In an analogy with stellar wind or accretion
problems, we demonstrate that there exists no transonic flow, but either
subsonic or supersonic flows are obtainable. Solutions of the supersonic
outflows are studied in detail as they are most likely to carry gas to large
distances away from galaxies. We find that if gravity is weak, the outflow is
characterized by the ratio of the radiative cooling time to the flow time,
$t_c/t_f$. The importance of the galactic gravitational field is characterized
by the fractional energy lost radiatively within the flow time in outflows with
velocity equal to the circular velocity of the galaxy; if the fraction is
small, gravity stops the outflow before the gas has a chance to cool
radiatively. In the case the gas does cool radiatively, the cooled gas is most
likely to form clouds via various instabilities. The clouds coast farther away
from the galaxy because of the finite kinetic energy they inherit. We find that
the hot gas in dwarf galaxies can either flow out as galactic winds, or cools
radiatively to form clouds. In the latter case, the clouds escape the galaxies.
In contrast, massive galaxies like our own tend to confine the gas. We present
the surface brightness in various x-ray energy bands. We also estimate the mean

We present the calculations of steady, spherical gas outflows from galaxies
in an effort to understand the effects of the galaxy mass on the flow
properties such as the size of the outflow regions, the efficiency of radiative
cooling, and the fate of the cooled gas. We show that there exist no transonic
flows but either subsonic or supersonic flows are obtainable, in an analogy
with the stellar wind or accretion problems. Solutions of the supersonic
outflows are studied in detail as they are most likely to carry gas to large
distances away from galaxies. In case the gas does cool radiatively, the cooled
gas is most likely to form clouds via various instabilities. The clouds coast
farther away from the galaxy because of the finite kinetic energy they inherit.
Depending on the initial energies, the clouds can either leave the galaxy or
fall back ballistically. Applications of the calculations to dwarf and normal
galaxies are made, and we argue that normal galaxies like our own should have
relatively small gaseous halos formed through this mechanism. We discuss the
implications of cold clouds from dwarf galaxies on recent observations of the
QSO absorption line systems. For massive galaxies, satellites provide
alternative ways to form large gaseous halos. We show how dynamical friction
can increase tidal stripping of the gas as the satellite spirals in toward the
primary, and that the gas ejected from satellites may account for the QSO heavy
element absorption lines.

The comparison of cosmic abundances of the light elements with the density of
baryonic stars and gas in the universe today provides a critical test of big
bang theory and a powerful probe of the nature of dark matter. A new technique
allows determination of cosmic deuterium abundances in quasar absorption clouds
at large redshift, allowing a new test of big bang homogeneity in diverse, very
distant systems. The first results of these studies are summarized, along with
their implications. The quasar data are confronted with the apparently
contradictory story from the helium-3 abundances measured in our Galaxy. The
density of baryonic stars and gas in the universe today is reviewed and
compared with the big bang prediction.

We report the serendipitous discovery of a large HI cloud with an associated
HI mass of $6(\pm1.5)\times 10^9 h^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ and a heliocentric velocity
8800 \kms, located near the periphery of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2634.
Its velocity field appears to be very quiescent, as no gradients in the peak
velocity are seen over its extent of 143$ h^{-1}$ by 103$ h^{-1}$ kpc. The
distribution of gas is poorly resolved spatially, and it is thus difficult at
this time to ascertain the nature of the cloud. At least two relatively small,
actively star--forming galaxies appear to be embedded in the HI gas, which may
(a) be an extended gaseous envelope surrounding one or both galaxies, (b) have
been spread over a large region by a severe episode of tidal disruption or (c)
have been affected by the ram pressure resulting from its motion through the
intracluster gas of A2634.

We have developed an accurate, one-dimensional, spherically symmetric,
Lagrangian hydrodynamics/gravity code, designed to study the effects of
radiative cooling and photo-ionization on the formation of protogalaxies. We
examine the ability of collapsing perturbations to cool within the age of the
universe. In contrast to some studies based on order-of-magnitude estimates, we
find that cooling arguments alone cannot explain the sharp upper cutoff
observed in the galaxy luminosity function. We also look at the effect of a
photoionizing background on the formation of low-mass galaxies.

For massive black hole binaries produced in galactic mergers, we examine the
possibility of inspiral induced by interaction with field stars. We model the
evolution of such binaries for a range of galaxy core and binary parameters,
using numerical results from the literature to compute the binary's energy and
angular momentum loss rates due to stellar encounters and including the effect
of back-action on the field stars. We find that only a small fraction of binary
systems can merge within a Hubble time via unassisted stellar dynamics.
External perturbations may, however, cause efficient inspiral. Averaging over a
population of central black holes and galaxy mergers, we compute the expected
background of gravitational radiation with periods Pw ~ 1-10 yr. Comparison
with sensitivities from millisecond pulsar timing suggests that the strongest
sources may be detectable with modest improvements to present experiments.

There is continued interest in the possibility that big bang nucleosynthesis
may produce significant quantities of Be and B. In this paper we reevaluate the
primordial abundances taking into account uncertainties in reactions rates. We
discuss the implications for primordial nucleosynthesis, and for galactic
cosmic ray spallation.

A search for X-ray emission from compact groups revealed detection from 8 out
of the 12 HCG images extracted from the ROSAT public archive. For two of them
the X-ray emission originates from galaxies in the group. On the contrary,
three groups show an extended emission clearly caused by hot intracluster gas.
A Raymond-Smith hot plasma model provides an excellent fit to the X-ray
spectra. The estimated temperatures are distributed in a quite narrow range
(from 0.73 to 0.92 keV) and are consistent, within the errors, with 0.9 keV.
The luminosity ranging from 0.75 to $5.1\cdot10^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$. The most
relevant result is the low metal abundance surely detected in two of them and
likely in a third that characterizes the hot gas cloud responsible for the
X-ray emission. The data concerning the remaining 3 detected compact groups are
not sufficient to discriminate with certainty between diffuse and/or point-like
X-ray emission. However the results of the spectral analysis point to the
presence of a hot gas again with low metal abundance.

We present high spatial resolution ground-based broad-band imaging, H-alpha
+[NII] narrow-band imaging and long-slit spectroscopy for the E4 radio galaxy
NGC 7052, which has a nuclear dust disc. We detect ionized gas with a LINER
spectrum, residing also in a nuclear disc. The gas rotates rapidly and the
emission line widths increase towards the nucleus.
  The images are well fit by an axisymmetric model with the gas and dust in a
disc of 1.5" radius (340 pc) in the equatorial plane of the stellar body,
viewed at an inclination of 70 degrees. We assume the gas to be on circular
orbits in the equatorial plane, with in addition a local turbulent velocity
dispersion. The circular velocity is calculated from the combined gravitational
potential of the stars and a possible nuclear black hole. The observed gas
rotation curve is well fit, either with or without a black hole. Turbulent
velocities >300 km/s must be present at radii <0.5" to fit the observed nuclear
line widths. Models with a black hole and no turbulence can also fit the line
widths, but these models cannot fit the observed nuclear line shapes. Models
with both a black hole and gas turbulence can fit the data well, but the black
hole is not required by the data, and if present, its mass must be < 5 x 10^8
solar masses. This upper limit is 5 times smaller than the black hole mass
inferred for M87 from HST data.
  Our modelling and analysis techniques will be useful also for the study of
the kinematics of nuclear gas discs in other galaxies. Such data will yield
important information on the presence of massive black holes.

We have developed an adaptive multigrid code for solving the Poisson equation
in gravitational simulations. Finer rectangular subgrids are adaptively created
in locations where the density exceeds a local level-dependent threshold. We
describe the code, test it in cosmological simulations, and apply it to the
study of the birth and evolution of a typical pancake singularity. The initial
conditions for the pancake are generated on the basis of the theory of
Lagrangian singularities; we follow its evolution for a few collapse times,
finding a rich substructure in the final object. We achieve a spatial
resolution of 1/1024 of the size of the overall computational cube in the
central parts of the pancake, with computing time comparable to that of the
FFT-solvers.

Distribution and properties of QSOs behind galaxy clusters in the UKJ287
field were studied. QSOs were selected using variability criteria and are
confined to $z \ge 0.4$ and $m_B \le 19.5$. No reddening or obscuration of
background QSOs due to dust in clusters is detected. A statistically
significant positive angular correlation between clusters ($\langle z\rangle
\simeq 0.15$) and QSOs ($0.4 \le z \le 2.2$) on scales of several arcminutes is
found. This number overdensity of QSOs behind clusters is ascribed to weak
gravitational lensing by foreground galaxy clusters. The overdensity of QSOs
increases as their limiting magnitude gets brighter in a way that would be
expected from a simple lensing model derived using Boyle, Shanks \& Peterson
(1988) QSO number counts and an average amplification of $A=2$ due to clusters.
The implied amplification is substantially larger than would be expected from
isothermal sphere clusters with a velocity dispersion $\sigma_v \sim 1000$
km/s.

Recently Wright (1994, preprint) has criticized a paper of ours on the
quasi-steady state cosmology (Hoyle et al. 1994, {\em M.N.R.A.S.,} {\bf 267,}
1007) arguing that the results from a radio source survey by Allington-Smith
(1982 {\em M.N.R.A.S.,} {\bf 199,} 611) show that our model published in the
paper referenced above is incorrect, and claiming farther that this result of
his invalidates the quasi-steady state cosmology. In this paper we have dealt
with his criticisms and have shown that he is wrong.

We study systematically stationary solutions to the coupled Vlasov and
Poisson equations which have `self-similar' or scaling symmetry in phase space.
In particular, we find analytically {\it all} spherically symmetric
distribution functions where the mass density and gravitational potential are
strict power laws in $r$, the distance from the symmetry point. We treat as
special cases, systems built from purely radial orbits and systems that are
isotropic in velocity space. We then discuss systems with arbitrary velocity
space anisotropy finding a new and very general class of distribution
functions. These distributions may prove useful in modelling galaxies.
Distribution functions in cylindrical and planar geometries are also discussed.
Finally, we study spatially spheroidal systems that again exhibit strict
power-law behaviour for the density and potential and find results in agreement
with results published recently.

Evolution of fast, radiative shocks in high density medium is presented.
Ionizing spectra and approximate broad band light curves of the shocked gas are
calculated. Emergent shock spectra, as seen by a distant observer, are obtained
from photoionization models. The emergent spectra have a power-law shape
$F_{\nu}\propto{\nu}^{-\alpha}$ with mean spectral index $\alpha\sim0.6-1.0$ in
the energy range $0.01-10$ keV, and have a high-energy cutoff corresponding to
the original shock velocity. It is shown that the models exhibit promising
features that may account for some photometric and spectral properties of
Active Galactic Nuclei.

Traditional evidence for large amount of dark matter is based on dynamical
consideration for systems with $ t_{dyn} \gg t_{obs} $. Recent observational
and theoretical developments in gravitational lensing offer a much more robust
determination of the mass distribution in some galaxies and their clusters,
with the precision comparable to that obtainable for double stars for which $
t_{dyn} < t_{obs} $, and offer independent and direct evidence for the presence
of dark matter. Gravitational microlensing and femtolensing offer a possibility
to detect MACHOs with masses in excess of $ \sim 10^{-15} ~ M_{\odot} $. The
recent detections of microlensing events by the EROS, MACHO and OGLE teams do
not require any dark lenses as ordinary low mass stars are compatible with the
observations. However, these searches will soon either detect genuine MACHOs,
or they will place stringent upper limits on their number density.

This contribution to the Proceedings is based on the talk given at the
Conference on Birth of the Universe and Fundamental Physics, Rome, May 18-21,
1994. Some selected topics of the subject are reviewed: Models of Primordial
Fluctuations; Reconstruction of the Cosmological Density Probability
Distribution Function (PDF) from Cumulants; PDFs from the Zel'dovich
Approximation and from Summarizing Perturbation Series; Fitting by the
Log-normal Distribution.

The reliability of cluster lens reconstruction techniques based on weak
lensing is studied in terms of the accuracy of their reproduction of the total
cluster mass as a function of distance from the cluster center. To do so, a
variety of reconstruction algorithms is applied to synthetic lensing data
created using a sample of 60 numerically modeled clusters, and the mass
reconstruction is compared to the known deflector mass. The results can be
summarized as follows: (1) Reconstruction algorithms which require integrations
extending over the entire real plane yield unreliable results, because they
give rise to boundary effects which are hard to control; mass overestimates are
more likely and more substantial in this case than underestimates. (2)
Reconstruction techniques which avoid these boundary effects yield reliable
lower bounds to the cluster mass. The tightness of such bounds depends on the
size of the field, which can be extended synthetically to improve the results
considerably. For the sample of numerical cluster models, the best lower
bounds, achieved by combining synthetic field extension with non-linear,
finite-field reconstruction, decline from 100% to 80% of the true cluster mass
going from the cluster center to an angular distance of 2.5'. The 80% error
bars of the lower mass bounds are +/- 10% to 15%.

It is examined whether primordial top quarks from the Big Bang could survive
under natural conditions till present days. Hybrid quark-neutron stars, with
dense enough core to maintain the existence of top quarks, is discussed. In
this paper only final states are investigated. Zero temperature quark-lepton
matter is modelled as as a gas of non-interacting particles. Local charge
neutrality has been assumed in order to avoid volume interactions which would
not make thermodynamical treatment possible.

Cosmic rays with energies exceeding $10^{20}\eV$ have been detected. The
origin of these highest energy cosmic rays remains unknown. Established
astrophysical acceleration mechanisms encounter severe difficulties in
accelerating particles to these energies. Alternative scenarios where these
particles are created by the decay of cosmic topological defects have been
suggested in literature. In this paper we study the possibility of producing
the highest energy cosmic rays through a process that involves formation of
metastable magnetic monopole-antimonopole bound states and their subsequent
collapse. The annihilation of the heavy monopole-antimonopole pairs
constituting the monopolonia can produce energetic nucleons, gamma rays and
neutrinos whose expected flux we estimate and discuss in relation to
experimental data so far available. The monopoles we consider are the ones that
could be produced in the early universe during a phase transition at the grand
unification energy scale. We find that observable cosmic ray fluxes can be
produced with monopole abundances compatible with present bounds.

Multicolour near IR photometry for a sample of 32 large barred spiral
galaxies is presented. By applying ellipse fitting techniques, we identify
significant isophote twists with respect to the primary bar axis in the nuclear
regions of $\sim$70 \%\ of the sample. These twists are identified in galaxies
as late as SBbc and are clearly distinguishable from spiral arm morphology. At
most seven of the galaxies with isophote twists are inferred to possess
secondary (nuclear) bars, the axis ratios of which appear to correlate with
morphological type. The remainder may result from triaxial bulges, or from
oblate bulges misaligned with the primary bar. The near IR colour distributions
in these data show evidence for (red) circumnuclear star forming rings in 4
galaxies. The majority of the sample (19) also possess striking blue nuclear
regions, bluer than typical old stellar populations by $\sim$0.3 mag. in (J--H)
and $\sim$0.23 mag. in (H--K). Such blue colours do not appear to correlate
with the presence of nuclear rings or pseudo--rings, nor with the activity of
the host galaxy (as determined from emission--line spectroscopic
characteristics). Several mechanisms to explain this blue colour are
considered.

We reconsider the problem of the origin of Low-Surface-Brightness (LSB)
galaxies within the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological model ($\Omega
=1, h=0.5$). Taking into account the effect of substructure on the collapse
times of low overdensity peaks, we show that the abundance of these peaks is
larger than previously expected because of the dragging caused by dynamical
friction induced by the presence of small-scale substructure. The number
density of these shallow, low-density peaks turns out to be in good agreement
with the observed overdensity of the blue LSB galaxies found during recent
surveys.

We shall show that the density of defects produced at a second-order phase
transition is determined by the correlation length of the fields. This is true
both for defects appearing in the Ginzburg regime and for defects produced at a
quench, when the Ginzburg regime is irrelevant.

A complete family of statistical descriptors for the morphology of
large--scale structure based on Minkowski--Functionals is presented. These
robust and significant measures can be used to characterize the local and
global morphology of spatial patterns formed by a coverage of point sets which
represent galaxy samples. Basic properties of these measures are highlighted
and their relation to the `genus statistics' is discussed. Test models like a
Poissonian point process and samples generated from a Voronoi--model are put
into perspective.

We measure the anisotropy of the redshift-space power spectrum in the 1.2-Jy
and QDOT redshift surveys of IRAS-selected galaxies. On large scales, this
anisotropy is caused by coherent peculiar motions, and gravitational
instability theory predicts a distortion of the power spectrum that depends
only on the ratio $\beta \equiv f(\Omega)/b \approx \Omega^{0.6}/b$, where
Omega is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the bias parameter. On
small scales, the distortion is dominated by the random velocity dispersion in
non-linear structures. We fit the observed anisotropy with an analytic model
that incorporates two parameters, beta, and a small-scale velocity dispersion
sigma_v. Tests on N-body simulations show that this model recovers beta quite
accurately on the scales accessible to the existing IRAS redshift surveys.
  Applying our procedure to the 1.2-Jy and QDOT surveys, we find beta=0.52 +/-
0.13 and beta=0.54 +/- 0.3, respectively. These results imply Omega
approximately 0.35 if galaxies trace mass, or a bias factor of about 2 if
Omega=1.

One of the main challenges in cosmology is to quantify how small density
fluctuations at the recombination epoch z around 1000 evolved into the galaxies
and the large-scale structure we observe in the universe today. This thesis
discusses ways of probing the intermediate epoch, focusing on the thermal
history. The main emphasis is on the role played by non-linear feedback, where
a small fraction of matter forming luminous objects can inject enough energy
into the inter-galactic medium to radically alter subsequent events. Chapter 2,
"A Cosmology Primer", provides a 60-page introduction to cosmology that may be
useful for the reader with a general physics background.

A method for extracting maximal resolution power spectra from microwave sky
maps is presented and applied to the 2 year COBE data, yielding a power
spectrum that is consistent with a standard n=1, Q=20 micro-Kelvin model. By
using weight functions that fall off smoothly near the galactic cut, it is
found that the spectral resolution \Delta l can be more than doubled at l=15
and more than tripled at l=20 compared to simply using galaxy-cut spherical
harmonics. For a future high-resolution experiment with reasonable sky
coverage, the resolution around the CDM Doppler peaks would be enhanced by a
factor of about 100, down to \Delta l\approx 1, thus allowing spectral features
such as the locations of the peaks to be determined with great accuracy. The
reason that the improvement is so large is basically that functions with a
sharp edge at the galaxy cut exhibit considerable "ringing" in the Fourier
domain, whereas smooth functions do not. The method presented here is
applicable to any survey geometry, chopping strategy and exposure pattern
whatsoever. The so called signal-to-noise eigenfunction technique is found to
be a special case, corresponding to ignoring the width of the window functions.

We investigate the existence and meaning of a preferred length in the
large-scale distribution of 60-micron IRAS sources applying three tests to the
2-dimensional distribution on the celestial sphere, involving respectively the
rms fluctuation and the correlation function of the source number density, and
the peak number statistics. For HDM models we find a best value lambda_0 =
45-55 h^{-1} Mpc for the peak of the spectral function P(k), close to the
preferred wavelength lambda = 30-40 h^{-1} Mpc of naive single-scale
perturbation models. A feature should indeed be generated in this range by the
anticorrelation region of xi(r), although it is not detected by recent Fourier
transform analyses of redshift catalogs. Our tests provide acceptable fits for
CDM models with either Omega = 0.3-0.5 or Omega = 0.1-0.2, in agreement with
results in current literature. However, the quality of such fits is less
satisfactory than for HDM models, with the exception of the peak number
statistics, and we are not able to find a parameter interval satisfying all of
our tests simultaneously. These results may indicate that the cosmic spectrum
is more complicated than the smooth shapes predicted by current theoretical
models.

The problem of formation of generic structures in the Universe is addressed,
whereby first the kinematics of inertial continua for coherent initial data is
considered. The generalization to self--gravitating continua is outlined
focused on the classification problem of singularities and metamorphoses
arising in the density field. Self--gravity gives rise to an internal hierarchy
of structures, and, dropping the assumption of coherence, also to an external
hierarchy of structures dependent on the initial power spectrum of
fluctuations.

The contour integral method of Hunter & Qian is applied to axisymmetric
galaxy models in which the distribution function (DF) is of the form
f=f(E,L_z), where E and L_z are the classical integrals of motion in an
axisymmetric potential. A practical way to construct the unique even part of
the DF for such systems is presented. It is applied to models, both oblate and
prolate, in which the mass density is stratified on similar concentric
spheroids.
  The spheroids with scale-free densities are discussed in detail. These
provide useful approximations to the behaviour of more realistic models in the
limit of small and large radii. The self-consistent case is treated, as well as
the case in which there are additional contributions to the potential from a
central black hole or dark halo. The range of axis ratios and density profile
slopes is determined for which spheroidal power--law cusps with a central black
hole have a physical two--integral DF.
  More generally, the f(E,L_z) DFs are discussed for a set of spheroidal
`(alpha,beta)-models', characterized by a power-law density cusp with slope
alpha at small radii, and a power-law density fall-off with slope [alpha + 2
beta] at large radii. As an application, the DF is constructed for the
(alpha,beta) model with a 1.8 x 10^6 solar mass black hole used by van der
Marel et al. to interpret their high spatial resolution spectroscopic data for
M32. The results confirm that the model fits the observed line-of-sight
velocity profiles remarkably well. The model is used to calculate predictions
for future spectroscopic observations with the HST.

We report the most recent results from high-resolution numerical simulations
of structure formation in two flat cold+hot dark matter models with neutrino
mass densities $\onu=0.2$ and 0.3. We find that structure forms too late in all
CDM+HDM models with $\onu>0.2$ to account for the amount of dense neutral gas
in high-redshift damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems. The $\onu=0.2$ model at
$z\approx0$ provides a better match to observations than the pure CDM model.

Invited Review at IAU Symp 164 on Stellar Populations. The Milky Way Galaxy
offers a unique opportunity for testing theories of galaxy formation and
evolution. The study of the spatial distribution, kinematics and chemical
abundances of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy allows one to address specific
questions pertinent to this meeting such as When was the Galaxy assembled? Is
this an ongoing process? What was the merging history of the Milky Way?

We study the generation and evolution of density perturbations and peculiar
velocities due to primordial magnetic fields. We assume that a random magnetic
field was present before recombination and follow the field's effect on the
baryon fluid starting at recombination. We find that magnetic fields generate
growing density perturbations on length scales larger than the magnetic Jeans
length, $\lambda_B$, and damped oscillations for scales smaller than
$\lambda_B$. For small wavenumbers $k$ (large length scales), we find the
magnetic field-induced density power spectrum generally scales as $k^4$. We
derive the magnetic Jeans length explicitly by including the back--reaction of
the velocity field onto the magnetic field by decomposing the magnetic field
into a force-free background field and perturbations about it. Depending on the
strength of the magnetic field and the ultraviolet cutoff of its spectrum,
structure can be generated on small or intermediate scales early in the history
of the universe. For a present {\it rms} magnetic field of $10^{-10}$ G on
intergalactic scales, we find that perturbations on galactic scales could have
gone non--linear at $z \simeq 6$. Finally, we discuss how primordial magnetic
fields affect scenarios of structure formation with non--baryonic dark matter.

We have analyzed Beta Pictoris photometric measurements obtained from La
Silla by the Geneva Observatory from 1975 to 1992. These data show evidence of
variations in the brightness of the star, with no color dependency. Here, we
demonstrate that the light variations are present on long as well as on short
time scales. On a long time scale, we show that the apparent magnitude of Beta
Pic decreased by 0.011 +/- 0.004 mag from 1979 to 1982. Moreover, when we
consider all the measurements, the chance that there is no variation at all can
be estimated to be less than 10E-4. On short time scales there is a peculiar
feature observed during about 30 days; the variations may be as high as 0.04
magnitude. A maximum entropy reconstruction of the photometric data is
tentatively proposed and some physical interpretations are presented.

In this paper we investigate, using high resolution N-body simulations, the
density profiles and the morphologies of galaxy clusters in seven models of
structure formation. We show that these properties of clusters are closely
related to the occurrence of a significant merging event in the recent past.
The seven models are: (1) the standard CDM model (SCDM) with $\Omega_0 = 1$,
$\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.5$; (2) a low-density flat model (FL03) with
$\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$; (3) an open model (OP03) with
$\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.75$; (4) a low-density flat model (FL02)
with $\Omega_0=0.2$, $\Lambda_0=0.8$ and $h=1$; (5) an open model (OP02) with
$\Omega_0=0.2$, $\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=1$; (6) a low-density flat model (FL01)
with $\Omega_0=0.1$ and $\Lambda_0=0.9$; (7) an open model (OP01) with
$\Omega_0=0.1$ and $\Lambda_0=0$. We find that the density profiles and
morphologies of clusters depend both on $\Omega_0$ and on $\Lambda_0$. For
$\Lambda_0=0$, these properties are a monotonic function of $\Omega_0$.
Clusters in OP01 have the steepest density profiles, their density contours are
the roundest and show the smallest center shifts. The other extreme case is
SCDM, where clusters show the least steep density profiles and the most
elongated contours. For a given $\Omega_0$ ($<1$), clusters in the flat model
(i.e. with $\Lambda_0=1-\Omega_0$) have flatter density profiles and less
substructures than in the corresponding open model. In particular, our results
show that low-density flat models with $\Omega_0\sim 0.3$, which are currently
considered as a successful alternative to SCDM, can produce a substantial
fraction of clusters with substructures. This is in contrast to the conception
that this kind of models may have serious problem in this aspect.

We explain the properties of X-ray selected BL Lacertae objects, under the
assumption that they constitute the small minority of the BL Lac population
with energy cutoff located in the UV/X-ray band, as suggested by their
multifrequency spectra. In particular, we derive their X-ray luminosity
function, log N-log S, and radio flux distribution starting from radio selected
BL Lacs using a method that does not require any free parameters. Our
hypothesis is at variance with the most common explanation for the existence of
two classes of BL Lacs, namely that X-ray selected objects are viewed
significantly off the beaming axis while radio-selected ones have their jets
more aligned with the line of sight. In this case, in fact, X-ray selected
sources should be intrinsically more numerous than objects selected in the
radio band at a fixed value of some isotropic luminosity such as that of the
diffuse radio emission. While also accounting for most of the properties of BL
Lacs detected in current X-ray surveys, this latter scenario would predict
their radio emission to be dominated by the extended (unbeamed) component, in
contrast with observations. We also address the question of the negative
evolution apparently exhibited by X-ray selected BL Lacs, showing that neither
recognition problems nor a break in the X-ray spectrum are likely to be
responsible for it. Our hypothesis explains in a simple way the bimodal
distribution of BL Lacs in the alpha_ro - alpha_ ox diagram. It also makes
specific predictions for the X-ray, radio, and optical properties of BL Lacs
which will be tested by future deep X-ray surveys.

The large-redshift (z=3.8) quasar 1208+1011 has recently been discovered to
be a gravitational lens candidate with a separation of 0.47" between the two
imaged components (A and B). NOT (Nordic Optical Telescope) and HST (Hubble
Space Telescope) studies from 1992 probing primarily the continuum light show
that the amplification of A relative to B is almost achromatic with the
canonical value A:B=4+/-0.1. In this paper we present high-resolution optical
images (FWHM=0.4"-0.5") from 1993 of the quasar. From our narrow-band CCD
frames centred on the redshifted Ly-alpha/Nv line at 5900 A we find that
A:B=3.85+/-0.2. Our broad-band I images uncontaminated by line-emission are
found to be affected by PSF variation over a range of 20\arcsec. However, by
iteratively determining the PSF from the images themselves we show that the
data can be accounted for by two point sources with A:B=3.35+/-0.2. These
results imply that the continuum intensity ratio has decreased during 1992-1993
and that the amplification of the emission-line regions relative to the
continuum emitting regions is different in the two components (under the
gravitational lens hypothesis). The most conservative interpretation of these
results is that 1208+1011 is a gravitationally lensed quasar in which component
B is being microlensed, but the possibility that 1208+1011 is a binary quasar
is not excluded by the present data.

Approximations to the exact solutions for gravitational instability in the
expanding Universe are extremely useful for understanding the evolution of
large--scale structure. We report on a series of tests of Newtonian Lagrangian
perturbation schemes using N--body simulations for various power--spectra with
scale--independent indices in the range $-3$ to $+1$. The models have been
evolved deeply into the non--linear regime of structure formation in order to
probe the dynamical and statistical performance of the Lagrangian perturbation
schemes (whose first--order solution contains as a subset the celebrated
``Zel'dovich--approximation'', hereafter ZA). These tests reveal properties of
the approximations at stages beyond the obvious validity of perturbation
theory. Recently, another series of tests of different analytical and
semi--numerical approximations for large--scale structure was conducted with
the result that ZA displays the best dynamical performance in comparison with
the N--body simulations, if the initial data were smoothed before evolving the
model, i.e., a truncated form of ZA (TZA). We show in this contribution that
the excellent performance of TZA can be further improved by going to second
order in the Lagrangian perturbation approach. The truncated second--order
Lagrangian scheme provides a useful improvement over TZA especially for
negative power indices, which suggests it will be very useful for modelling
standard scenarios such as ``Cold--'', ``Hot--'' and ``Mixed--Dark--Matter''.

The light profiles of elliptical (E) galaxies are known to display small
systematic deviations (0.1-0.2 mag.) from the R^1/4 law. In this paper we show
that the senses and amplitudes of these departures can be naturally accounted
for by a simple distribution function constructed on the basis of statistical
mechanics of violent relaxation. As a consequence, detailed light-profiles can
be used to infer about the central potentials of E galaxies (the only free
shape parameter of our model). Furthermore, the small deviations have recently
been shown to correlate with luminosity, L. This observation entails a slight
breaking of the generally assumed structural homology between E galaxies. Using
our model we parametrize this broken homology by establishing a correlation
between a suitably normalized central potential and luminosity. The
non-homology means that a basic assumption in the interpretation of the
Fundamental Plane (FP) breaks down, and with it the conclusions derived from
it. Instead, by assuming that M/L is independent of luminosity, we derive a
relation akin to the FP directly from our correlation. This implies that the FP
may have a simple stellar dynamical origin. We can reproduce the observed
Carlberg-Kormendy relation for the central phase-space densities (f_c) of E
galaxies of identical structure, f_c = L^-2.35, but non-homology changes it to
a much weaker dependence (f_c = L^-1.5 for constant M/L) which would imply that
the central phase-space densities of ellipticals are comparable to those of
spiral galaxies. Thus dissipationless merging is consistent with the FP,
although HST observations, notably the presence of nuclear embedded disks,
indicate that the assumptions behind our model break down for the nuclei of
faint E galaxies in which dissipative processes seem to be important.

Microlensing searches toward the inner galaxy $(|l|,|b|\leq 22.\hskip-2pt'5)$
have several major advantages. First, the event rate is strongly dominated by
bulge-bulge lensing events where both the source and lens lie in the bulge.
Second, these bulge-bulge events have very short time scales $t_e\sim 2\,$days
and are therefore easily distinguished from the less frequent and much longer
bulge-disk and disk-disk events. Third, since the optical depth is similar to
that at higher impact parameters, while the events are shorter, the event rate
is high $\Gamma\sim 3\times 10^{-7}\rm day^{-1}$. Fourth, because the Einstein
rings are small, $r_e\sim 5\times 10^{12}\,$cm, and the source stars are large
$r_s\gsim 10^{12}\,$cm, the lens will transit the face of the source for a
significant fraction $(\sim 20\%)$ of events. For these transit events it will
often be possible to measure a second lens parameter, the angular Einstein
radius (or proper motion). In addition to the bulge-bulge events, the optical
depth of the disk is $\sim 7$ times larger toward the inner Galaxy than toward
Baade's Window. A microlensing search toward the inner Galaxy can be carried
out by making frequent $(\sim4\,\rm day^{-1})$ K band images of a large area
$\sim 0.5\,\rm deg^2$ to a depth of $K\sim 16$, and hence requires either a
$1024^2$ infrared array on a dedicated 2m telescope or four such arrays on a 1m
telescope.

We model the dynamics of test binaries in isotropic, multi-mass models of
galactic globular clusters. The evolution of binary orbits through the cluster
potentials is modeled, including second order diffusion terms, and
probabilities for close encounters with field stars are calculated. We carry
out Monte Carlo simulations of the effects of the binary--single star
encounters on the binary population and distribution in the cluster, and
estimate the collision rate for different stellar populations in globular
clusters with different structural parameters. Assuming a Salpeter IMF, for low
concentration clusters the core encounter rate is dominated by turnoff mass
main--sequence stars and medium mass white dwarfs. For high concentration, high
density clusters the encounter probabilities are increasingly dominated by
neutron stars and heavy white dwarfs. Hence we predict a smaller ratio of blue
stragglers and cataclysmic variables to pulsars in high concentration clusters.
The total number of millisecond pulsars, and the ratio of single to binary
pulsars, is broadly consistent with the observed population, suggesting the
binary--single star encounters contribute significantly to the pulsar formation
rate in globular clusters, for the whole range of globular cluster types. The
number of millisecond pulsars and the ratio of pulsars in different globular
clusters is best explained by a total binary fraction comparable to that of the
galaxy, and a modest number of primordial neutron stars in the globular
clusters.

Some aspects of the theory of cosmological perturbations from cosmic strings
and other topological defects are outlined, with particular reference to a
simple example: a spatially flat CDM-dominated universe. The conserved
energy-momentum pseudo-tensor is introduced, and the equation for the density
perturbation derived from it. It is shown how the scaling hypothesis for defect
evolution results in a Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum for wavelengths well inside
the horizon.

We summarize the plans for and the current status of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, a digital imaging and spectroscopic survey of $\pi$ steradians in the
northern Galactic cap. The CCD photometric survey will produce images in five
bands to limiting magnitudes of order 23. The spectroscopic survey will obtain
redshifts of $10^6$ galaxies (a complete sample to a limiting magnitude $r'
\sim 18$) and $10^5$ quasars ($g' \sim 19$). Repeated imaging of a 200 deg$^2$
strip in the southern Galactic cap will yield information about variable
objects and a co-added photometric catalog roughly two magnitudes deeper than
the northern survey. A dedicated 2.5-meter telescope, a large multi-CCD camera,
and two fiber-fed double spectrographs are under construction and should be
operational by fall of 1995. The main galaxy redshift sample will have a median
redshift $\langle z \rangle \approx 0.1$.

The relation between the galaxy correlation function in real and
redshift-space is derived in the linear regime by an appropriate averaging of
the joint probability distribution of density and velocity. The derivation
recovers the familiar linear theory result on large scales but has the
advantage of clearly revealing the dependence of the redshift distortions on
the underlying peculiar velocity field; streaming motions give rise to
distortions of ${\cal O}(\Omega^{0.6}/b)$ while variations in the anisotropic
velocity dispersion yield terms of order ${\cal O}(\Omega^{1.2}/b^2)$. This
probabilistic derivation of the redshift-space correlation function is similar
in spirit to the derivation of the commonly used ``streaming'' model, in which
the distortions are given by a convolution of the real-space correlation
function with a velocity distribution function. The streaming model is often
used to model the redshift-space correlation function on small, highly
non-linear, scales. There have been claims in the literature, however, that the
streaming model is not valid in the linear regime. Our analysis confirms this
claim, but we show that the streaming model can be made consistent with linear
theory {\it provided} that the model for the streaming has the functional form
predicted by linear theory and that velocity distribution is chosen to be a
Gaussian with the correct linear theory dispersion.

Astrophysical observations indicate that the ``Local Universe" has a
relatively lower matter density ($\Omega_0$) than the predictions of the
standard inflation cosmology and the large-scale motions of galaxies which
provide a mean mass density to be very close to unity. In such a local
underdense region the Hubble expansion may not be representative of the global
behaviour. Utilizing an underdense sphere embedded in a flat universe as the
model of our ``Local Universe", we show that the local Hubble constant would be
1.2 -- 1.4 times larger than the global value on scale of $\sim80$ Mpc,
depending on the variation of $\Omega_0$. This may account for the recent
measurements of the unpleasantly large Hubble constant of $\sim$80 km/s/Mpc
using the Cepheid variables in the Virgo cluster and the relative distance
between Virgo and Coma cluster and removes the resulted apparent paradox of the
age of our universe.

Observed intensities and inferred distances of soft gamma repeaters imply
luminosities in excess of the nominal (electron-scattering opacity) Eddington
limit by four to six orders of magnitude. I review the physical basis of this
limit. Accretional luminosities may exceed it if energy is hydrodynamically
coupled from accreting matter to closed field lines where it forms a pair gas.
This magnetically confined pair gas radiates roughly a black body spectrum with
$k_B T_e \approx 23$ KeV, consistent with observations, at a luminosity up to
$\sim 3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a surface field of $10^{13}$ gauss.
Magnetic transparency is not required. I discuss the minutes-long continuing
emission of March 5, 1979, steady counterparts to SGR, their spin periods and
the recoil problem.

We have taken deep $R$-band images of fields around five radiogalaxies:
0956+47, 1217+36, 3C256, 3C324 and 3C294 with $1<z<2$ . 0956+47 is found to
show a double nucleus. Our data on 1217+36 suggest the revision of its
classification as a radiogalaxy. We found a statistically significant excess of
bright ($19.5<R<22$) galaxies on scales of 2 arcmin around the radiogalaxies
(which have $R \approx 21.4$) in our sample. The excess has been determined
empirically to be at $\gtrsim 99.5\%$ level. It is remarkable that this excess
is not present for $22<R<23.75$ galaxies within the same area, suggesting that
the excess is not physically associated to the galaxies but due to intervening
groups and then related to gravitational lensing.

We use a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the spectra of mildly
relativistic thermal plasmas in pair balance. We use the exact integral
expression for the electron-positron thermal annihilation spectrum, and provide
accurate expressions for the Gaunt factors of electron-ion, electron-electron,
and electron-positron thermal bremsstrahlung in the transrelativistic
temperature regime. The particles are assumed to be uniformly distributed
throughout a sphere, and the pair opacity is self-consistently calculated from
the energy and angular distribution of scattered photons. The resultant photon
spectra are compared with the nonrelativistic diffusion treatment of Sunyaev
and Titarchuk, the bridging formulas of Zdziarski, and the relativistic
corrections proposed by Titarchuk. We calculate allowed pair-balanced states of
thermal plasmas with no pair escape which include bremsstrahlung and internal
soft photons. The results are presented in the spectral index/compactness
plane, and can be directly compared with observations of spectra from AGNs and
Galactic black hole candidates. By comparing with X-ray spectral indices of
Seyfert AGNs and compactnesses inferred from X-ray variability data, we find
that the allowed solutions for pair equilibrium plasma imply that the
temperatures of Seyfert galaxies are $\lesssim 300$ keV. This prediction can be
tested with more sensitive gamma-ray observations of Seyfert galaxies. We find
that if the X-ray variability time scale gives an accurate measure of the
compactness, pair-dominated solutions are inconsistent with the data.

A soft X-ray shadow has been discovered on the periphery of the Loop I
supershell in the ROSAT All Sky Survey. The distance, size, geometry and
spectral data indicate that it is cast by an annular volume of dense neutral
matter which has formed in the collision of the Loop I superbubble and the
Local Hot Bubble. This is the first observation of the interaction region of
two colliding interstellar bubbles, and the results are consistent with earlier
theoretical work on colliding spherical shock waves.

We develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of dark
haloes. The statistical properties of dark haloes are determined from the
initial density field (assumed to be Gaussian) through an extension of the
Press-Schechter formalism. Gravitational clustering is treated by a spherical
model which describes the concentration of dark haloes in collapsing regions.
We test this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations. The
autocorrelation function of dark haloes in such simulations depends
significantly on how haloes are identified. Our predictions agree well with
results based on algorithms which break clusters into subgroups more
efficiently than the standard friends-of-friends algorithm. The agreement is
better than that found by assuming haloes to lie at the present positions of
peaks of the linear density field. We use these techniques to study how the
distribution of haloes is biased with respect to that of the mass. The initial
(Lagrangian) positions of haloes identified at a given redshift and having
circular velocities $v_c=v_c^*(z)$ (i.e. mass equal to the characteristic
nonlinear mass $M^*$ at that redshift) are very weakly correlated with the
linear density field or among themselves. As a result of dynamical evolution,
however, the present-day correlations of these haloes are similar to those of
the mass. Haloes with lower $v_c$ are biased toward regions with negative
overdensity, while those with higher $v_c$ are biased toward regions with
positive overdensity. Among the haloes identified at any given epoch, those
with higher circular velocities are more strongly correlated today. Among the
haloes of given circular velocity, those at higher redshifts are also more
strongly clustered today. In the ``standard CDM'' model, haloes with

While the recent discovery of the Cepheid variables in the Virgo cluster
galaxies puts additional support for the Hubble constant $H_0 \sim
80$km/sec/Mpc, a relatively lower value $H_0 \sim 50$km/sec/Mpc is suggested by
other distance indicators based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the
gravitational lens which probe the universe at higher redshifts $z=(0.1\sim
1)$. In order to reconcile the possible discrepancy between the estimates of
the Hubble constants from nearby galaxy samples and high-redshift clusters, we
consider a model of locally open universe embedded in the spatially flat
universe. We find analytic expressions for the lower limit on the global Hubble
constant $\hg$, and the upper limit on the age of the universe with a given
value for the Hubble constant $\hl$ in the local universe. We conclude that it
is quite unlikely that the above difference in the estimates of the Hubble
constant is explained within the framework of the gravitational instability
picture.

We have obtained evidence of gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV from PSR1706-44,
using a ground-based telescope of the atmospheric \v{C}erenkov imaging type
located near Woomera, South Australia. This object, a $\gamma$-ray source
discovered by the COS B satellite (2CG342-02), was identified with the radio
pulsar through the discovery of a 102 ms pulsed signal with the EGRET
instrument of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The flux of the present
observation above a threshold of 1 TeV is $\bf \sim $ 1 $\cdot$ 10$^{-11}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the
extrapolation from GeV energies. The analysis is not restricted to a search for
emission modulated with the 102 ms period, and the reported flux is for all
$\gamma$-rays from PSR1706-44, pulsed and unpulsed. The energy output in the
TeV region corresponds to about 10$^{-3}$ of the spin down energy loss rate of
the neutron star.

We call attention to the surprising similarity between the newly discovered
planetary system around PSR B1257+12 and the inner solar system. The similarity
is in the ratios of the orbital radii and the masses of the three planets.

We present {\it Hubble Space Telescope} and ground--based data on the
$z_{abs}=0.8596$ metal line absorption system along the line of sight to PKS
0454+0356. The system is a moderate redshift damped Lyman alpha system, with
${\rm N(HI)}=(5.7\pm0.3)\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ as measured from the {\it
Faint Object Spectrograph} spectrum. We also present ground--based images which
we use to identify the galaxy which most probably gives rise to the damped
system; the most likely candidate is relatively underluminous by QSO absorber
standards ($M_B \sim -19.0$ for $q_0=0.5$ and $H_0=50$ \kms Mpc$^{-1}$), and
lies $\sim 8.5h^{-1}$ kpc in projection from the QSO sightline. Ground--based
measurements of Zn~II, Cr~II, and Fe~II absorption lines from this system allow
us to infer abundances of [Zn/H]=$-1.1$, [Cr/H]=$-1.2$, and [Fe/H]=$-1.2$,
indicating overall metallicity similar to damped systems at $z >2$, and that
the depletion of Cr and Fe onto dust grains may be even {\it less} important
than in many of the high redshift systems of comparable metallicity. Limits
previously placed on the 21-cm optical depth in the $z=0.8596$ system, together
with our new N(H~I) measurement, suggest a very high spin temperature for the
H~I, $T_S >> 580$ K.

In the weak field approximation, the nonsymmetric gravitational theory has,
in addition to the Newtonian gravitational potential, a Yukawa potential
produced by the exchange of a spin $1^+$ boson between fermions. If the range
$r_0$ is of order $30$ kpc, then the potential due to the interaction of known
neutrinos in the halos of galaxies can explain the flat rotation curves of
galaxies. The results are based on a physical linear approximation to the NGT
field equations and they are consistent with equivalence principle
observations, other solar system gravitational experiments and the binary
pulsar data.

We propose to minimise the cosmic confusion between Gaussian and non Gaussian
theories by investigating the structure in the m's for each multipole of the
cosmic radiation temperature anisotropies. We prove that Gaussian theories are
(nearly) the only theories which treat all the m's equally. Hence we introduce
a set of invariant measures of ``m-preference'' to be seen as non-Gaussianity
indicators. We then derive the distribution function for the quadrupole
``m-preference'' measure in Gaussian theories. A class of physically motivated
toy non Gaussian theories is introduced as an example. We show how the
quadrupole m-structure is crucial in reducing the confusion between these
theories and Gaussian theories.

We discuss the effect of matter reionization on the large-angular-scale
anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR)
in the standard CDM model. We separate three cases in which the anisotropy is
induced by pure scalar, pure tensor, and mixed metric perturbations
respectively. It is found that, if reionization occurs early enough, the
polarization can reach a detectable level of sequentially $6\%$, $9\%$, and
$6.5\%$ of the anisotropy. In general, a higher degree of polarization implies
a dominant contribution from the tensor mode or reionization at high redshift.
Since early reionization will suppress small-scale CMBR anisotropies and
polarizations significantly, measuring the polarization on few degree scales
can be a direct probe of the reionization history of the early universe.

Neutron star binaries, such as the one observed in the famous binary pulsar
PSR 1916+13, end their life in a catastrophic merge event (denoted here
NS$^2$M). The merger releases $\approx 5 \cdot 10^{53}$ergs, mostly as
neutrinos and gravitational radiation. A small fraction of this energy suffices
to power $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) at cosmological distances. Cosmological
GRBs must pass, however, an optically thick fireball phase and the observed
$\gamma$-rays emerge only at the end of this phase. Hence, it is difficult to
determine the nature of the source from present observations (the agreement
between the rates of GRBs and NS$^2$Ms being only an indirect evidence for this
model). In the future a coinciding detection of a GRB and a gravitational
radiation signal could confirm this model.

Motivated by recent measurements of the major components of the cosmic
radiation around 10 TeV/nucleon and above, we discuss the phenomenology of a
model in which there are two distinct kinds of cosmic ray accelerators in the
galaxy. Comparison of the spectra of hydrogen and helium up to 100 TeV per
nucleon suggests that these two elements do not have the same spectrum of
magnetic rigidity over this entire region and that these two dominant elements
therefore receive contributions from different sources.

A self-consistent solution for a thin accretion disk with turbulent
convection is presented. The disk viscosity and the convective flux are derived
from a physical model for turbulence, and expressed in terms of the local
physical conditions of the disk which, in turn, are controlled by the former
two. In the gas pressure region, two distinct solutions are obtained. In one,
the convective flux is much larger than the radiative flux and the blackbody
region extends over the entire gas pressure region and could also extend down
to the inner boundary of the disk. In this solution the temperature profile is
close to adiabatic. In the other solution, the convective flux is about a third
of the total flux, and there exist the gas pressure blackbody and electron
scattering regions as well as the radiation pressure region. In the radiation
pressure region, the temperature profile is very close to adiabatic, and the
disk is geometrically thin and optically thick even for super Eddington
accretion rates. The fraction of the convective flux, out of the total flux,
increases with the accretion rate, and for accretion rates comparable to the
Eddington limit is close to 1. This variation stabilizes the, radiation
pressure region, so that the disk regions are secularily stable.

We propose that cosmic rays originate mainly in three sites, a) normal
supernova explosions into the interstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into
stellar winds, and c) hot spots of powerful radio galaxies. The proposal
depends on an assumption about the scaling of the turbulent diffusive transport
in cosmic ray mediated shock regions; the proposal also uses a specific model
for the interstellar transport of cosmic rays. The model has been investigated
in some detail and compared to i) the radio data of OB stars, Wolf Rayet stars,
radio supernovae, radio supernova remnants, Gamma-ray line and continuum
emission from starforming regions, and the cosmic ray electron spectrum, ii)
the Akeno air shower data over the particle energy range from 10 TeV to EeV,
and iii) the Akeno and Fly's Eye air shower data from 0.1 EeV to above 100 EeV.
Here we specifically discuss in some detail the assumptions inherent in the
model proposed, concerning the transport of energetic particles, first in the
acceleration region, and second in the Galaxy.

We have systematically analyzed a sample of 13 new and archival ROSAT PSPC
observations of compact groups of galaxies: 12 Hickson Compact Groups plus the
NCG 2300 group. We find that approximately two-thirds of the groups have
extended X-ray emission and, in four of these, the emission is resolved into
diffuse emission from gas at a temperature of $k$T $\sim 1$ keV in the group
potential. All but one of the groups with extended emission have a spiral
fraction of less than 50\%. The baryon fraction of groups with diffuse emission
is 5--19\%, similar to the values in clusters of galaxies. However, with a
single exception (HCG 62), the gas-to-stellar-mass ratio in our groups has a
median value near 5\%, somewhat greater than the values for individual
early-type galaxies and two orders of magnitude lower than in clusters of
galaxies. The X-ray luminosities of individual group galaxies are comparable to
those of similar field galaxies, although the L$_X$-L$_B$ relation for
early-type galaxies may be flatter in compact groups than in the field.

Solutions to the energy-independent (gray) radiative transfer equations are
compared to results of Monte Carlo simulations of the \Ni and \Co radioactive
decay \GR energy deposition in supernovae. The comparison shows that an
effective, purely absorptive, gray opacity, \KG $\sim (0.06 \pm 0.01)Y_e$
cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$, where $Y_e$ is the total number of electrons per baryon,
accurately describes the interaction of \GRs with the cool supernova gas and
the local \GR energy deposition within the gas. The nature of the \GR\
interaction process (dominated by Compton scattering in the relativistic
regime) creates a weak dependence of \KG on the optical thickness of the
(spherically symmetric) supernova atmosphere: The maximum value of \KG applies
during optically thick conditions when individual \GRs undergo multiple
scattering encounters and the lower bound is reached at the phase characterized
by a total Thomson optical depth to the center of the atmosphere \te \LA 1. Our
results quantitatively confirm that the quick and efficient solution to the
gray transfer problem provides an accurate representation of \GR energy
deposition for a broad range of supernova conditions.

The search for the origin of cosmic rays is a quest of almost a hundred
years. A recent theoretical proposal gives quantitative predictions, which can
be tested with data. Specifically, it has been suggested, that all cosmic rays
can be attributed to just three source sites: i) supernova explosions into the
interstellar medium, ii) supernova explosions into a stellar wind, and iii)
powerful radiogalaxies. The cosmic rays from any extragalactic source suffer
from interaction with the microwave background, leading to the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. While the particle energies, the spectrum and
the chemical composition of cosmic rays over the energy range from about GeV to
about 100 EeV can be interpreted in the theory, there are exciting measurements
now: New measurements show that there are cosmic ray events beyond the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. We discuss here possible sources, and
specifically ask whether powerful radiogalaxies are suitable candidates. The
basic concepts used here are the minimal hypothesis that the intergalactic
magnetic field is given by the galaxy distribution, and the observation that
radio galaxies also cluster like galaxies.

We report on the detection of PSR 1706-44 in two ROSAT-PSPC observations. The
recorded source counts are unpulsed with a $2\sigma$ pulsed fraction upper
limit of 18%. Spectral analysis did not distinguish between black-body and
power law models; however, we argue that the lack of pulsations and the
similarity in the pulsar's spin parameters to those of the Vela pulsar favour a
power law model $dN/dE\propto E^{-2.4\pm 0.6}$ and indicate synchrotron
emission from a pulsar-powered nebula as the origin of the detected
X-radiation. The X-ray flux derived for the power law model is
f_x=3.2^{+6.5}_{-1.8} x E-12 erg/ s/ cm^2 within the 0.1-2.4 keV energy range.
An upper limit for the neutron star's surface temperature is put at Log
T_s^\infty \sim 6.03 K for a neutron star with a medium stiff equation of state
(FP-model with M=1.4 Mo, R=10.85 km). Slightly different values for
$T_s^\infty$ are computed for the various neutron star models available in the
literature, reflecting the difference in the equation of state. No soft X-ray
emission is detected from the supernova remnant G343.1-2.3, proposed to be
associated with PSR 1706-44.

Following a suggestion by Gasperini and Veneziano, that String Cosmology can
be reconciled with Inflation and, hence, with the Standard Big Bang, we display
an analytical solution which possesses four interesting properties: (1) it is
non-singular; (2) it distinguishes the dynamics of the external scale factor,
$a(t)$, from that of the internal one, $b(t)$; (3) it exhibits a non-monotonic
behavior of $a(t)$; and (4) it stabilizes both Newton's constant and $b(t)$
(the latter to a finite, non-vanishing value). The interest of the
non-monotonic evolution of $a(t)$ consists in the fact that it contains three
phases of accelerated expansion, contraction and expansion before the final
decelerated expansion which eventually becomes the Standard Big Bang. The total
number of e-folds of the three accelerated eras can be calculated and tuned to
fit the requests of observational astronomy.

Quasars are the earliest objects known to exist. We examine their origin in
the context of popular models for structure formation in the universe. We show
that seeds for quasar black holes could have originated from the initial
cosmological collapse of overdense regions with unusually small rotation. Most
of these seeds have a mass of order 10^6 solar masses, just above the
cosmological Jeans mass. For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, we find of order one
seed black hole per bright galaxy. After the galaxy forms, the seeds inside its
bulge sink to the center by dynamical friction. We also describe a few
empirical methods to study the properties of quasars and their environments.
These include: probing quasar hosts through [C II] emission, finding quasar
lifetimes from the ``proximity effect'' along two lines of sight, and measuring
the amplitude of clustering at high redshifts through the detection of
Lyman-alpha clouds beyond the quasar redshift.

A time dependent two-point correlation-function analysis of the BATSE 2B
catalog finds no evidence of burst repetition. As part of this analysis, we
discuss the effects of sky exposure on the observability of burst repetition
and present the equation describing the signature of burst repetition in the
data. For a model of all burst repetition from a source occurring in less than
five days we derive upper limits on the number of bursts in the catalog from
repeaters and model-dependent upper limits on the fraction of burst sources
that produce multiple outbursts.

We use a representative sample of 65 galaxy clusters observed with the
Einstein IPC to constrain the range of cluster X-ray morphologies. We develop
and apply quantitative and reproducible measures to constrain the intrinsic
distributions of emission weighted centroid variation, axial ratio,
orientation, and the radial fall--off. We then use the range of cluster X--ray
morphologies to constrain three generic cosmological models (Omega=1,
Omega_0=0.2, and Omega_0=0.2 & lambda_0=0.8). For each of these models, we
evolve eight sets of Gaussian random initial conditions consistent with an
effective power spectrum $P(k)\propto k^{-1}$ on cluster scales. Using this
sample of 24 numerical cluster simulations, we compare the X--ray morphologies
of the observed and simulated clusters. The comparisons indicate that: (i)
cluster centroid variations, axial ratios, and radial fall-offs are sensitive
to the underlying cosmological model, and (ii) galaxy clusters with the
observed range of X--ray morphologies are very unlikely in low Omega_0
cosmologies. The analysis favors the Omega=1 model, though some discrepancies
remain. We discuss the effects of changing the initial conditions and including
additional physics in the simulations.

A class of Kaluza-Klein cosmologies recently proposed is compared with
observations of the cosmic microwave background. Some models are ruled out,
while others turn out to be viable, with the number of extra dimensions being
constrained by the COBE and Tenerife experiments.

For known gravitational lens systems the redshift distribution of the lenses
is compared with theoretical expectations for $10^{4}$~Friedmann-Lema\^\i
tre~cosmological models, which more than cover the range of possible cases. The
comparison is used for assigning a relative probability to each of the models.
The entire procedure is repeated for different values of the inhomogeneity
parameter~$\eta$ and the limiting spectroscopic magnitude~$m_{\rm lim}$, which
is important for selection effects. The dependence on these two parameters is
examined in more detail for the special cases~$\lambda_{0}=0$ and $k=0$.
  Previous results that this method is a better probe for~$\lambda_{0}$ than
$\Omega_{0}$ are confirmed, but it appears that the low probability of models
with large~$\lambda_{0}$~values found using similar methods is due to a
selection effect.
  The power of this method to discriminate between cosmological models can of
course be improved if more gravitational lens systems are found. However, our
numerical simulations indicate that a reasonable number of observed systems
cannot deliver interesting constraints on the cosmological parameters.

Using IRAM 30m, SEST 15m, and Nancay radiotelescopes, we have gathered the
1mm continuum emission, spectra of the J=1--0 CO line and of the HI line at
21cm for two samples of IRAS galaxies. Using these data, we have estimated the
HI masses, the H$_2$ masses and the dust masses. We find that for far-infrared
selected galaxies: (1) the median value of M$_{H2}$/M$_{HI}$ is 0.5, meaning
that the atomic phase dominates in these galaxies. The fraction of gas in
molecular form increases with increasing FIR luminosity but does not show any
obvious trend with other galaxy properties. (2) the $H2$ surface density (s.d.)
is better correlated with the cold dust s.d. than the HI s.d., but the
correlation of HI with dust is not negligible. Globally in these galaxies the
cold dust emission is associated with both the molecular and atomic phases. (3)
the FIR surface brightness increases as the third power of the S60um/S100um
ratio, it shows a tight correlation with both the H$_2$ and dust surface
densities and a weaker one with the HI surface density: a large part of the
far-infrared emission of these galaxies originates in the molecular medium. (4)
the gas-to-dust ratio ranges between 100 and 1000 and its average value is 230,
close to the Galactic value. There is indeed a clear trend: this ratio
decreases as the FIR surface density increases, a result which can be explained
in the framework of an enhancement of metallicity in galaxy discs having a
higher star formation rate.

The distribution of galaxies up to a distance of 200 Mpc (650 million
light-years) is flat and shows a structure like a shell roughly centered on the
Local Supercluster (Virgo cluster). This result clearly confirms the existence
of the hypergalactic large scale structure noted in 1988. This is presently the
largest structure ever seen.

We consider directly the equations by which matter imposes anisotropies on
freely propagating background radiation, leading to a new way of using
anisotropy measurements to limit the deviations of the Universe from a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry. This approach is complementary to
the usual Sachs-Wolfe approach: the limits obtained are not as detailed, but
they are more model-independent. We also give new results about combined
matter-radiation perturbations in an almost-FRW universe, and a new exact
solution of the linearised equations.

We describe a version of an algorithm for evolving self-gravitating
collections of particles that should be nearly ideal for parallel
architectures. Our method is derived from the ``self-consistent field'' (SCF)
approach suggested previously by Clutton-Brock and others. Owing to the use of
a global description of the gravitational field, the particles in an SCF
simulation do not interact with one another directly, minimizing communications
overhead between nodes in a parallel implementation. Ideal load-balancing is
achieved since precisely the same number of operations are needed to compute
the acceleration for each particle. Consequently, the SCF technique is
perfectly scalable and the size of feasible applications will grow in simple
proportion to advances in computational hardware. We describe an SCF code
developed for and tested on a Connection Machine 5. Empirical tests demonstrate
the efficient and scalable nature of the algorithm. Depending on the
application, simulations with particle numbers in the range $N\sim 10^7 -
10^{8.5}$ are now possible. Larger platforms should make simulations with
billions of particles feasible in the near future. Specific astrophysical
applications are discussed in the context of collisionless dynamics.

HST observations of eight intrinsically luminous quasars with redshifts
between $0.16$ and~$0.29$ are presented. Seven companion galaxies brighter than
$M_V = -16.5$ lie within a projected distance of 25 kpc of the quasars; three
of the companions are located closer than $3''$ (6 kpc projected distance) from
the quasars, well within the volume that would be enclosed by a typical $L^*$
host galaxy. The observed association of quasars and companion galaxies is
statistically significant and may be an important element in the
luminous-quasar phenomenon. Evidence for candidate host galaxies is presented
for the three most promising cases: PG 1116+215, 3C 273, and PG 1444+407, but
additional observations are required before the characteristics of the
candidate hosts can be regarded as established. Upper limits are placed on the
visual-band brightnesses of representative galactic hosts for all of the
quasars. These limits are established by placing galaxy images obtained with
HST underneath the quasars and measuring at what faintness level the known
galaxies are detected. On average, the HST spirals would have been detected if
they were one magnitude fainter than $L^*$ or brighter and the early-type
galaxies could have been detected down to a brightness level of about $L^*$,
where $L^*$ is the Schechter characteristic luminosity of field galaxies.

The observation by the BATSE instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are distributed isotropically around the Earth but
nonuniformly in distance has led to the widespread conclusion that GRBs are
most likely to be at cosmological distances, making them the most luminous
sources known in the Universe. If bursts arise from events that occur in normal
galaxies, such as neutron star binary inspirals, then they will also occur in
our Galaxy about every hundred thousand to million years. The gamma-ray flux at
the Earth due to a Galactic GRB would far exceed that from even the largest
solar flares. The absorption of this radiation in the atmosphere would
substantially increase the stratospheric nitric oxide concentration through
photodissociation of N$_2$, greatly reducing the ozone concentration for
several years through NO$_x$ catalysis, with important biospheric effects due
to increased solar ultraviolet flux. A nearby GRB may also leave traces in
anomalous radionuclide abundances.

A survey of CO(3-2) emission from optically visible oxygen-rich Mira variable
stars within 500 pc of the sun was conducted. A molecular envelope was detected
surrounding 36 of the 66 stars examined. Some of these stars have lower outflow
velocities than any Miras previously detected in CO. The average terminal
velocity of the ejected material was 7.0 km/sec, about half the value found in
Miras selected by infrared criteria. None of the stars with spectral types
earlier than M 5.5 were detected. The terminal velocity increases as the
temperature of the stellar photosphere decreases, as would be expected for a
radiation driven wind. Mass loss rates for the detected objects were
calculated, and it was found that there is no correlation between the infrared
color of a Mira variable, and its mass loss rate. The mass loss rate is
correlated with the far infrared luminosity, although a few stars appear to
have extensive dust envelopes without any detectable molecular wind. A
power-law relationship is found to hold between the mass loss rate and the
terminal velocity of the ejected material. This relationship indicates that the
dust envelope should be optically thick in the near infrared and visible
regions of the spectrum when the outflow velocity is > 17 km/sec. At the low
end of the range of outflow velocities seen, the dust drift velocity may be
high enough to lead to the destruction of the grains via sputtering. Half of
the stars which were detected were re-observed in the CO(4-3) transition. A
comparison of the outflow velocities obtained from these observations with
those obtained by other investigators at lower frequencies shows no evidence
for gradual acceleration of the outer molecular envelope.

The long-lived spots caused by the impact of fragments of Comet S-L 9 on
Jupiter can be understood if clouds of dust are produced by the impact. These
clouds reside in the stratosphere, where they absorb visible light that would
ordinarily reflect from the cloud deck below, and reflect radiation at infrared
wavelengths that would ordinarily be absorbed by atmospheric methane. Here we
show that, provided that the nucleus of a fragment is composed substantially of
silicates and has a diameter greater than about 0.4 km, dust in the required
amounts will condense from the hot gas composed of cometary and Jovian material
ejected from the site where the fragment entered, and the dust will be
suspended in the stratosphere for long periods. Particles about 1$\;\mu$m in
radius can explain both the optical properties and longevities of the spots.
According to our model, a silicate band should be present in the $10 - \mu$m
spectra of the spots.

This paper is the first part of the Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars in the
Galactic bulge. The Catalog is based on observations collected during the OGLE
microlensing search. 213 periodic variable stars brighter than I=18 mag: 31
pulsating, 116 eclipsing and 66 miscellaneous type variables from the Baade's
Window BWC field are presented. Periodic variable stars from remaining 20
fields will be presented in similar form in the next parts of the Catalog. The
Catalog as well as observations of all periodic variable objects are available
to astronomical community over the Internet network.

Motivated by the recent determinations of the Hubble constant $(H_0)$ from
observations of Cepheid variables in NGC4571 and M100, we plot the Tinsley
diagram with level curves of the cosmological constant $(\Lambda)$. Based on
current estimates of the absolute ages of globular clusters we conclude that
$\Lambda > 0$ and, irrespective of the background spatial curvature, the
universe will not recollapse. These conclusions hold for both relativistic and
Newtonian models and are {\it independent} of the density parameter.

Recent progress in the measurement of relative distances to galaxies has been
quite substantial, and catalogs of 3000 galaxies with distances are soon to
become available. The peculiar {\it velocity} field (deviations from Hubble
flow) derivable from these catalogs, when compared to the peculiar {\it
gravity} field derived from all sky redshift surveys of galaxies such as the
1.2Jy IRAS survey, leads to a unique and extremely powerful test of the density
parameter $\beta \equiv \Omega^{0.6}/b_I$, where $b_I$ is the possible linear
bias of the IRAS selected galaxies relative to the mass fluctuations. We review
the status of these large scale flow measurements and present a new methodology
to describe the two fields by means of an expansion in a set of orthogonalized
functions describing a general potential flow to any chosen resolution. The
parameters of the flow can be estimated by minimization of the $\chi^2$
describing the scatter of observed versus predicted linewidths from an inverse
Tully-Fisher relation. By this method one can intercompare the gravity and
velocity fields coefficient by coefficient, deriving a precise fit for the
density parameter and an assessment of the degree of coherence between the
fields. The present situation is transitory-- different analyses of the same
data are not yielding consistent results. Until this embarassment is untangled,
estimates of $\beta$ should be taken with a large grain of salt.

The lack of success of Lyman-alpha searches for high-redshift (z>2) field
galaxies may be due to extinction by dust, suggesting that surveys based on
lines of longer wavelength, particularly H-alpha, may be more effective. To
test the dust hypothesis we have undertaken deep broad- (K') and narrow-band
(5000 km/s, 2.177 micron) imaging of the field towards the quasar PHL957, in an
attempt to detect H-alpha emission from a known galaxy of redshift z=2.313. We
cover an area of 4.9 square arcmin (0.28 h^{-2}Mpc^2) to a 4-sigma limiting
narrow-band flux f=2.7x10^{-16}erg/s/cm^2, a factor of several deeper than
previously published surveys. We detect the H-alpha+[N II] emission line in
this galaxy at the 3.3-sigma level, inferring a star formation rate of 18
h^{-2} solar masses per year. This is a factor only a few times larger than the
rate seen in some Sc galaxies today. The faint flux level reached in this work
demonstrates the promise of narrow-band imaging in the near-infrared as a
technique for finding normal galaxies at high redshifts.

We have investigated the effects of primeval starbursts on the galactic
structure, showing that the dynamical structure of young galaxies is changed by
relaxation of a stellar system formed by a starburst-driven outflowing gas
(superwind). When a superwind interacts with halo gas, an expanding dense
supershell of shocked gas is formed. Using a similarity solution for the
expanding shell and a condition for the gravitational instability of a gaseous
shell, we show that an expanding gaseous shell with a mass of several $10^{10}
M_\odot$ and a radius of several kpc becomes gravitationally unstable to form
stars. A stellar shell is thus formed, relaxes and will evolve into a fat
stellar system. \par In order to investigate the fate of the stellar shell and
its dynamical influence on the host galaxy, we performed three dimensional
$N$-body simulations of a stellar shell plus disk system. The evolution of the
stellar shell was computed under two types of environment: an external
flattened potential and a live stellar disk. We find that the relaxation
process and resultant structure are significantly affected by the external disk
potential, and also depend on the velocity dispersion of the initial shell
stars and the mass of the shell. The final galactic structure ranges from a
thick disk and a compact bulge with a high density core to a thin disk with a
diffuse bulge. Isodensity maps of the computed disk plus bulge system resemble
isophotes of S0 galaxies. We suggest that the effects of primeval starbursts
would explain some observational properties of S0 galaxies.

Starting from the observed distribution of galaxy clusters in redshift space
we use a two--step procedure to recover their distances and peculiar
velocities. After statistically correcting for the unobserved cluster
distribution in the zone of avoidance ($|b|\le 20^{\circ}$) and also for a
smooth absorption at higher $|b|$'s, we use a dynamical iterative algorithm to
recover the real--space cluster positions by minimizing the redshift space
distortions. The whole procedure assumes that clusters trace the mass, that
peculiar velocities are caused by gravity and that linear perturbation theory
applies. The amplitude of the cluster dipole measured in the 3D space turns out
to be $\sim 23\%$ less than that measured in redshift space. In both cases the
dipole direction is aligned with the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole within
$\sim 10^{\circ}$, taking into account the Virgocentric infall component of the
Local Group motion. Observational errors, limitations in the reconstruction
procedure and the intrinsic cosmological variance, which is the dominant source
of uncertainty, render a stringent determination of the $\beta$ parameter whose
central value turns out to be $\beta \approx 0.2$ while its total uncertainty
is $\pm 0.1$. This implies that for a cluster-mass bias parameter of $\sim 5$,
a flat Universe is not excluded, contrary to previous cluster-dipole $z$-space
analysis.

We present broad band surface photometry of the radio galaxy 3C270
(NGC~4261). We find a distinct dust lane in the $V-R$ image of the galaxy, and
determine its orientation and size. We use the major axis profile of the galaxy
to estimate the optical depth of the dust lane, and discuss the significance of
the lane to the shape of the galaxy.

Supernova explosions into predecessor stellar winds can lead to particle
acceleration, which we suggest can explain most of the observed cosmic rays of
the nuclei of Helium and heavier elements, from GeV in particle energies up to
near $3 \, 10^9$ GeV, as well as electrons above about 30 GeV. We go through
the following steps:
  1) Using a postulated underlying principle that leads to transport
coefficients in a turbulent plasma, we derive the properties of energetic
particles accelerated in spherical shocks.
  2) We suggest that a dynamo working in the inner convection zone of an upper
main sequence star can lead to high magnetic field strengths.
  3) Such magnetic fields may put additional momentum into stellar winds from
the pressure gradient of the toroidal field.
  4) We derive a lower limit for the magnetic field strengths.
  5) There appears to be a critical Alfv\'enic Machnumber for electron
injection. With this concept we propose an explanation for the observed
proton/electron ratio in galactic cosmic rays at GeV energies.
  6) We check the model prediction quantitatively on cosmic ray spectrum and
chemical composition against airshower data and further cosmic ray data.
  7) Finally, we summarize various important caveats, and outline important
next steps as well as checks.

We present the results of modeling 5, 8 and 15 GHz maps of the gravitational
lens MG1131+0456 using the LensClean algorithm. Two models for the mass
distribution in the lens were fit: a de Vaucouleurs model and a model with the
two-dimensional potential phi = b^{2-alpha}(r^2+s^2)^{alpha/2}/2alpha, both in
an external shear field. The best fit de Vaucouleurs model has an effective
radius of R_e = 0.83+-0.13 arcseconds, larger than that measured at optical
wavelengths. The best fit ``alpha model'' has alpha=0.6+-0.2 and a core radius
of s = 0.19 +- 0.07 arcseconds. An isothermal model (alpha=1) is inconsistent
with the data. The best alpha model fits the 8 GHz map significantly better
than the best de Vaucouleurs model. Although it is difficult to distinguish
visually the original image and the reconstructions, none of the models is
statistically consistent with the data. We believe the primary problem is that
an external shear is an inadequate model for the angular structure of the lens
galaxy. The finite core radius in the models is required by the structure of
the extended ring, so we confirm that the central component in the 8 GHz map is
a central, lensed image of the source rather than the lens galaxy. The model
lens positions, the position angle of the shear, and the mass interior to the
ring are determined very precisely by the lens models. The time delay between
the compact components is predicted with an uncertainty we estimate to be at
most +- 9%; the formal uncertainty is +- 4%.

We generate random Gaussian turbulent velocity fields with a Kolmogorov
spectrum and use these to obtain synthetic line-of-sight velocity profiles. The
profiles are found to be similar to line profiles observed in molecular clouds.
We suggest methods for analysing measured line profiles to test whether they
might arise from Gaussian Kolmogorov turbulence.

Surface thermal emission has been detected by ROSAT from four nearby young
neutron stars. Assuming black body emission, the significant pulsations of the
observed light curves can be interpreted as due to large surface temperature
differences produced by the effect of the crustal magnetic field on the flow of
heat from the hot interior toward the cooler surface. However, the energy
dependence of the modulation observed in Geminga is incompatible with blackbody
emission: this effect will give us a strong constraint on models of the neutron
star surface.

We consider Bayesian constraints on standard isocurvature baryon models from
the slope and normalization of the anisotropy power spectrum detected by the
COBE DMR experiment in their two year maps. In conjunction with either the
amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ {\it or} its slope, all open models
are ruled out at greater than 95\% confidence, whereas cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ dominated models are constrained to be highly ionized. By including
the COBE FIRAS 95\% confidence upper limit on spectral distortion, we further
reduce the available parameter space for $\Lambda$ models by excluding these
highly ionized models. These constraints define a single class of barely viable
standard models which makes definite and testable predictions for degree scale
anisotropies and large scale structure.

The observations of radio emission from SNR~1987A can be accounted for on the
basis of diffusive shock acceleration of electrons by the supernova blast wave.
However, with this interpretation the observed spectral index implies that the
compression ratio of the gas subshock is roughly $2.7$ rather than the value of
$4$ expected of a strong shock front. We propose that in SNR~1987A, ions also
undergo diffusive acceleration at the shock, a process that is likely to be
rapid. Unlike the electron population, the accelerated ions can have an
important effect on the gas dynamics. We calculate this coupled gas and
energetic particle dynamics on the basis of the two-fluid model, in which the
accelerated ions provide an additional component to the total pressure acting
on the fluid. By accelerating and possibly heating the upstream plasma, the
initially strong shock is modified and a weaker subshock with an upstream
precursor results. The electrons behave as test particles. They are accelerated
at the evolving subshock, escape downstream, and emit synchrotron radiation in
the swept up magnetic field. Two models are considered for the surroundings of
the progenitor: that of a freely expanding wind of number density $n\propto
r^{-2}$, and that of a wind confined by a shell of denser material, creating a
stagnation zone of roughly constant density beyond the standing shock which
terminates the free wind. We model the observed radio light curves and the
relatively steep spectrum of SNR~1987A using similar values for the ion
acceleration parameters to those used in models of cosmic ray acceleration in
older SNRs which can also contain high Mach number shocks, and find a good fit
for the case in which the termination shock is located at about $2\times
10^{15}\,$m from the progenitor.

We present a new analysis of the presently available photometric data for the
gravitationally lensed quasar 0957+561 A,B with the aim of determining the time
delay between its two images. The basic method used is the dispersion
estimation technique. Even by using the simplest non-parametric form of our
method we can convincingly rule out a time delay near 536 days and show that
the time delay is in the vicinity of 420 days. We then introduce refinements to
our method in order to get a stable and reliable result for the time delay
independent of high frequency noise in the data and sampling errors. Our best
result for the time delay, checked by various statistical tests and using
bootstrap error estimates, is 423 +/- 6 days. We furthermore confirm our
earlier result that the radio data are compatible with this value. Using the
best available model for the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy and
cluster, our result for the time delay constrains the Hubble parameter to be
smaller than 70 km/(s Mpc).

Observations show that there is significant clustering of QSO metal
absorption lines within the range of velocity dispersion between 200km/sec and
600 km/sec. With a reasonable supernova rate, it is shown that high velocity
gases driven by SNe and/or strong stellar winds could explain the clustered
absorptions, provided that QSO metal-line absorbers are galactic halos or dwarf
galaxies. Rich clusters of galaxies, on the other hand, cannot yield the
observed clustering of QSO metal absorption lines.

We calculate the flux and size ratio of radio emitting features moving in
antiparallel directions at relativistic speeds, taking into account that the
pattern we observe may move at a velocity different from the one of the
emitting plasma. Both velocities can be determined in sources in which both the
approaching and the receding features are observed. This is the case of the
galactic superluminal source GRS 1915+105, for which the pattern speed
(responsible for the apparent superluminal velocity) was found to be 0.92$c$.
For this source we find that the velocity of the plasma is 0.73$c$. The found
velocity helps decreasing the estimate of the associated kinetic power. Since
intrinsically identical knots will be observed to have different sizes, high
resolution radio observations of GRS 1915+105 will be a test for the proposed
difference of the pattern and plasma velocities.

We discuss the physics of vortices in the circumstellar disks associated with
young stellar objects. We elucidate the basic physical properties of these
localized storm systems. In particular, we consider point vortices, linear
vortices, the effects of self-gravity, magnetic fields, and nonlinear aspects
of the problem. We find that these vortices can exist in many different forms
in the disks of young stellar objects and may play a role in the formation of
binary companions and/or giant planets. Vortices may enhance giant planet
formation via gravitational instability by allowing dust grains (heavy
elements) to settle to the center on a short timescale; the gravitational
instability itself is also enhanced because the vortices also create a larger
local surface density in the disk. In addition, vortices can enhance energy
dissipation in disks and thereby affect disk accretion. Finally, we consider
the possibility that vortices of this type exist in molecular clouds and in the
disk of the galaxy itself. On all of these size scales, vortices can produce
long-lived structures which may correspond to observed structures in these
systems.

Evolution of the statistical distribution of density field is investigated by
means of a counts-in-cells method in a low-density cold-dark-matter simulated
universe. Four theoretical distributions, i.e. the negative binomial
distribution, the lognormal distribution, the Edgeworth series and the skewed
lognormal distribution, are tested to fit the calculated distribution function,
and it is shown that only the skewed lognormal distribution of second and third
order can describe the evolution of the statistical distribution perfectly well
from the initially Gaussian regime to the present stage. The effects of sparse
sampling is also investigated and it is discussed that one should use a sample
with number density of galaxies larger than $\sim 0.01h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$ in order
to recover underlying density distribution.

Extensive, accurate imaging of the Cosmic Background Radiation temperature
anisotropy at sub--degree angular resolution is widely recognized as one of the
most crucial goals for cosmology and astroparticle physics in the next decade.
We review the scientific case for such measurements in relation with sky
coverage, attainable sensitivity, confusing foreground radiation components,
and experimental strategies. Although ground--based and balloon--borne
experiments will provide valuable results, only a well--designed, far--Earth
orbit space mission covering a wide spectral range and a significant part of
all the sky will provide decisive answers on the mechanism of structure
formation.

Polarization of the cosmic microwave background, though not yet detected,
provides a source of information about cosmological parameters complementary to
temperature fluctuations. This paper provides a complete theoretical treatment
of polarization fluctuations. After a discussion of the physics of
polarization, the Boltzmann equation governing the evolution of the photon
density matrix is derived from quantum theory and applied to microwave
background fluctuations, resulting in a complete set of transport equations for
the Stokes parameters from both scalar and tensor metric perturbations. This
approach is equivalent at lowest order in scattering kinematics to classical
radiative transfer, and provides a general framework for treating the
cosmological evolution of density matrices. The metric perturbations are
treated in the physically appealing longitudinal gauge. Expressions for various
temperature and polarization correlation functions are derived. Detection
prospects and theoretical utility of microwave background polarization are
briefly discussed.

We present measurements of the shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity
distribution out to two effective radii along the major axes of the four
elliptical galaxies NGC 2434, 2663, 3706, and 5018. The velocity dispersion
profiles are flat or decline gently with radius. We compare the data to the
predictions of f=f(E,L_z) axisymmetric models with and without dark matter.
Strong tangential anisotropy is ruled out at large radii. We conclude from our
measurements that massive dark halos must be present in three of the four
galaxies, while for the fourth galaxy (NGC 2663) the case is inconclusive.

Hamilton et al. (1991) proposed a simple formula relating the nonlinear
autocorrelation function of the mass distribution to the primordial spectrum of
density fluctuations for gravitational clustering in an $\Omega=1$ universe.
High resolution N-body simulations show this formula to work well for
scale-free spectra $P(k) \propto k^n$ when the spectral index $n\sim 0$, but
not when $n \lsim -1$. We show that a modified version of the formula can work
well provided its form depends on $n$. This dependence can be derived from a
simple physical model for collapse from Gaussian initial conditions. Our
modified formula is easy to apply and is an excellent fit to N-body simulations
with $0 \leq n \leq -2$. It can also be applied to non-power law initial
spectra such as that of the standard Cold Dark Matter model by using the local
spectral index at the current nonlinear scale as the effective value of $n$ at
any given redshift. We give analytic expressions both for the nonlinear
correlation function and for the nonlinear power spectrum.

The following principle of minimum energy may be a powerful substitute to the
dynamical perturbation method, when the latter is hard to apply. Fluid elements
of self-gravitating barotropic flows, whose vortex lines extend to the boundary
of the fluid, are labelled in such a way that any change of trial
configurations automatically preserves mass and circulation. The velocity field
is given by a mass conserving Clebsch representation. With three independent
Lagrangian functions, the total energy is stationary for all small variations
about a flow with fixed linear and angular momenta provided Euler's equations
for steady motion are satisfied. Thus, steady flows are stable if their energy
is minimum. Since energy is here minimized subject to having local and global
contants of the motion fixed, stability limits obtained that way are expected
to be close to limits given by dynamical perturbation methods. Moreover, the
stability limits are with respect to arbitrary, not necessary small,
perturbations. A weaker form of the energy principle is also given which may be
easier to apply. The Lagrangian functional, with the same three Lagrange
variables is stationary for the fully time dependent Euler equations. It
follows that the principle of minimum energy gives stability conditions that
are both necessary and sufficient if terms linear in time derivatives
(gyroscopic terms) are absent from the Lagrangian. The gyroscopic term for
small deviations around steady flows is given explicitly. Key words: Energy
variational principle; Self-gravitating systems; Stability of fluids.

It's well known that there are structure of the distribution of the nearest
light stars (Herschel(1847) and Guld(1879)). Some visual phenomena which
connected with numbering by brightness give possible evidence of the existence
more thin structure.

We explore here the idea, reminiscent in some respect of Von Weizsacker's
(1944) and Alfven's (1976) outmoded cosmogonies, that long-lived vortices in a
turbulent protoplanetary nebula can capture large amount of solid particles and
initiate the formation of planets. Some puzzling features of the solar system
appear as natural consequences of our simple model: - The captured mass
presents a maximum near Jupiter's orbit. - Outside this optimal orbit, the
collected material, mainly composed of low density particles, sinks deeply into
the vortices and rapidly collapses into massive bodies at the origin of the
solid core of the giant planets. - Inside this orbit, by contrast, the high
density particles are preferentially selected by the vortices and assembled by
local gravitational instabilities into planetesimals, massive enough to be
released by the vortices and to grow later, in successive collisions, to form
the terrestrial planets. - The captured mass presents a maximum near Jupiter's
orbit. - Outside this optimal orbit, the collected material, mainly composed of
low density particles, sinks deeply into the vortices and rapidly collapses
into massive bodies at the origin of the solid core of the giant planets. -
Inside this orbit, by contrast, the high density particles are preferentially
selected by the vortices and assembled by local gravitational instabilities
into planetesimals, massive enough to be released by the vortices and to grow
later, in successive collisions, to form the terrestrial planets.

There has been some disagreement about the strength of evolution exhibited by
IRAS galaxies. With a parameterisation such that the co-moving density
increases as $(1+z)^P$ measurements of $P$ range from $2\pm3$ to $6.7\pm2.3$.
We have recently completed a deep IRAS redshift survey which should help to
clarify the situation. Paying particular attention to possible systematic
effects (notably Malmquist Bias) we claim positive detection of evolution
within this sample at the $3\sigma$ level. Our best estimate of the strength of
evolution seen in this survey is $P=5.6\pm1.6\pm0.7$ corresponding to
luminosity evolution $L(z)=L_{z=0}(1+z) ^{3.3\pm0.8\pm0.6}$. This estimate is
consistent with all previous determinations of the rate of cosmological
evolution of IRAS galaxies. Neither this survey nor any previous survey is
sufficiently deep to distinguish between pure luminosity and pure density
evolution nor between different parameterisation of these forms.

We evaluate the ability of the BATSE spectroscopy detectors to detect the
absorption lines observed by Ginga in gamma ray burst spectra. We find that
BATSE can detect the 20.6 keV line in the S1 segment of GB870303 with a
detection probability of ~1/4 in nearly normally incident bursts, with the
probability dropping off to nearly 0 at a burst angle of 50 degrees; the lines
at 19.4 and 38.8 keV lines in GB880205 have a high detection probability in
BATSE up to burst angles of 75 degrees. In addition, we calculate detection
probabilities for these two line types as a function of signal-to-noise ratio
and burst angle for use in detailed comparisons between BATSE and Ginga.
Finally, we consider the probability averaged over the sky of detecting a line
feature with the actual array of BATSE detectors on CGRO.

Direct comparisons of diffusive particle acceleration numerical simulations
have been made against Monte Carlo and hybrid plasma simulations by Ellison
{\it et. al.} (1993) and against observations at the earth's bow shock
presented by Ellison {\it et. al.} (1990). Toward this end we have introduced a
new numerical scheme for injection of cosmic-ray particles out of the thermal
plasma, modeled by way of the diffusive scattering process itself; that is, the
diffusion and acceleration across the shock front of particles out of the
suprathermal tail of the Maxwellian distribution. We find that all of these
computational methods (diffusion-advection, two-fluid, Monte Carlo and hybrid)
are in substantial agreement on the issues they can simultaneously address, so
that the essential physics of diffusive particle acceleration is adequately
contained within each. This is despite the fact that each makes what appear to
be very different assumptions or approximations.

A simple algorithm is presented for the calculation of the projected
line-of-sight velocity profiles (VPs) of non-rotating anisotropic spherical
stellar dynamical models with a phase-space distribution function of the
Osipkov-Merritt type. The velocity distribution in these models is isotropic
inside the anisotropy radius r_a and becomes increasingly radially biased at
larger radii. VP shape parameters are presented for a family of models in which
the luminous mass density has an r^{-gamma} power-law cusp at small radii and
an r^{-4} power-law fall-off at large radii. Self-consistent models and models
in which the luminous matter is embedded in a dark halo are discussed. The
effects of changes in the cusp slope gamma and in the anisotropy radius r_a are
documented, and the area in the (gamma,r_a)-plane that contains physical models
is delineated. The shapes of the VPs of the models show a considerable (and
observable) variation with projected galactocentric radius. These models will
be useful for interpreting the data on the VP shapes of elliptical galaxies
that are now becoming available.

The peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the clustering pattern
anisotropically in redshift space. This effect on the statistics of isodensity
contours is examined by linear theory. The statistics considered in this paper
are the three- and two-dimensional genus of isodensity contours, the area of
isodensity contours, the length of isodensity contours in the 2-dimensional
slice and the level crossing statistics on the line. We find that all these
statistics in redshift space as functions of density threshold of contours have
the same shape as in real space. The redshift space distortion affects only
amplitudes of these statistics. The three-dimensional genus and the area hardly
suffer from the redshift space distortion for $0 \leq \Omega b^{-5/3} \leq 1$,
where $b$ is a linear bias parameter. The other statistics are defined in one-
or two-dimensional slices of the sample volume and depend on the direction of
these slices relative to the line of sight. This dependence on direction of
these statistics provides a way to determine the density parameter of the
universe.

We develop technique concerning statistical analyses of the large-scale
structure of the universe in the presence of biasing in the structure
formation. We formulate the diagrammatic method to calculate the correlation
functions of the nonlocally biased field from a generally non-Gaussian density
field. Our method is based on generalized Wiener-Hermite expansion of the
density field. The present formalism has not only general applicability, but
also practical significance, too. To show the effectiveness of this method, we
revisit the problems on biasing that have been considered previously, i.e.,
various approximations for peak statistics and hierarchical structure of
correlation functions of locally biased field. Further analyses which have not
been possible so far on these problems can be performed by our formalism. The
gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuation or other structure-forming
processes can be described by nonlocal biasing, so can be treated by our new
formalism in principle.

Microlensing of extended stellar sources in the LMC and Galaxy by low mass
lenses can produce variable polarisation. The characteristics of the
polarisation and flux profiles can provide considerable information about the
lens geometry, and help determine the importance of such low mass objects as a
dark matter component.

We have studied the importance of the combined effects of rotation,
diffusion, and convective overshoot on the p-mode oscillation spectrum and the
neutrino flux of the standard solar model. To isolate the various physical
affects included in the new rotation plus diffusion models we also constructed
solar models to test the significance of diffusion and of overshoot by
themselves. In previous studies, models that include helium diffusion during
solar evolution were found to improve the predicted p-mode frequencies for some
modes and worsen the agreement for others (Guenther \ea 1993). Here we verify
this result for both the Bahcall and Loeb (1990) formulation of diffusion and
the Proffitt and Michaud (1991) formulation of diffusion. We find that the
effects of rotation on the Sun's structure in the outer layers perturbs the
$p$-mode frequencies only slightly when compared to the more substantial
effects due to diffusion. In the thin overshoot layer (taken here to be $0.1\,
H_p$), we have compared the effect of overmixing in a radiative layer versus
convective (adiabatic) penetration. Neither radiative overmixing nor adiabatic
penetration has any significant effect on the $p$-modes, probably in part
because the overshoot layer is constrained to be thin. The predicted neutrino
flux in our diffusion plus rotation model is 7.12 SNU for Cl detectors, 127 SNU
for Ga detectors and $5.00\times 10^6\,{\rm erg \, cm^{-2} }$ for the $^8$B
neutrinos; this is approximately half-way between the standard solar model
without diffusion, and the standard solar model with diffusion alone.

We investigate the imprint of nonlinear matter condensations on the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) in an $\Omega=1$, Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model
universe. Temperature anisotropies are obtained by numerically evolving matter
inhomogeneities and CMB photons from the beginning of decoupling until the
present epoch. The underlying density field produced by the inhomogeneities is
followed from the linear, through the weakly clustered, into the fully
nonlinear regime. We concentrate on CMB temperature distortions arising from
variations in the gravitational potentials of nonlinear structures. We find two
sources of temperature fluctuations produced by time-varying potentials: (1)
anisotropies due to intrinsic changes in the gravitational potentials of the
inhomogeneities and (2) anisotropies generated by the peculiar, bulk motion of
the structures across the microwave sky. Both effects generate CMB anisotropies
in the range of $10^{-7} \siml \Delta T/T \siml 10^{-6}$ on scales of $ \sim
1^{\circ}$. For isolated structures, anisotropies due to proper motion exhibit
a dipole-like signature in the CMB sky that in principle could yield
information on the transverse velocity of the structures.

The white dwarf luminosity function of a stellar cluster will have a sharp
truncation at a luminosity which is determined by the time since formation of
the first white dwarfs in that cluster. Calculation of the dependence of this
limiting luminosity on age requires relatively well-understood physics and is
independent of stellar evolutionary models. Thus, measurement of the
termination of the white dwarf luminosity function provides an independent
method to determine the age of a cluster, and thereby to calibrate stellar
evolutionary ages. We have obtained HST WFPC2 data in two open clusters,
identified the white dwarf sequence, and proved the feasibility of this
approach, by detecting white dwarfs to V=25. Much deeper data are feasible.
From our present limited data, we show that degenerate cooling ages are not
consistent with some published isochrone ages for clusters with ages of order
1Gyr.

Paramagnetic alignment of suprathermally rotating grains is discussed in view
of recent progress in understanding subtle processes taking place over grain
surface. It is shown that in typical ISM conditions, grains with surfaces of
amorphous H$_{2}$O ice, defected silicate or polymeric carbonaceous material
are likely to exhibit enhanced alignment, while those of aromatic carbonaceous
material or graphite are not. The critical grain sizes and temperature for the
Purcell's alignment are obtained and preferential alignment of large grains is
established.

Near-infrared surveys have very promising cosmological applications. The
DENIS 2 micron survey, currently in camera-testing, is scheduled to begin in
early 1995, and to map the entire southern sky in the $I$, $J$, and $K'$ bands.
The steps for the near-homogeneous extraction of $\sim 10^5$ galaxies are
outlined, some pitfalls are given, and the estimated limiting capabilities of
the survey are presented. A preliminary $J$-band image illustrates these
capabilities and some of the hidden pitfalls. The necessary spectroscopic
followup is shown to be feasible on a reasonably short timescale.

Using simulated images, we test various methods, for the homogeneous
detection of objects in DENIS images. The optimal detection limits depend on
the object type and the sky background, but little on the PSF or the smoothing
filter used to increase the signal-to-noise of the images.

In this paper I review how near-infrared (NIR) observations can constrain the
opacity of spiral disks. Basic considerations show that NIR photometry provides
a powerful probe of the optical depths in spiral galaxy disks in the regime of
interest, where the optical depth in the V-band is near unity. I review the
existing opacity constraints from the analysis of dust lanes in edge-on and
face-on galaxies. The ``internal extinction correction" in the NIR-Tully-Fisher
relation deserves particular attention as the most powerful constraint on the
impact of dust on the total luminosity of spiral galaxies. All observations for
luminous spirals point towards an effective, face-on optical depth of
tau_V=0.5-1.

The shapes of dark halos (e.g. spherical, oblate or triaxial) provide
important clues to the formation history of the halos, to their baryon content
and to the nature of the dark matter. The halo shapes also influence the
dynamics of the galaxy they harbor. This review discusses the current status of
theoretical predictions (halo formation in a cosmological context with and
without a dissipative component) and of the observational constraints on halo
shapes. Halos are neither predicted nor observed to be spherical.

Using new and archival spectra from the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph,
we have searched for evidence of chromospheric and transition region emission
in six stars of mid- to late-A spectral type. Two of the stars, alpha Aql (A7
IV-V) and alpha Cep (A7 IV-V), show emission in the C~II 1335 A doublet,
confirming the presence of hot plasma with temperatures comparable to that of
the solar transition region. Using radiative equilibrium photospheric models,
we estimate the net surface fluxes in the C II emission line to be 9.4 X 10^4
erg/cm/cm/s for alpha Aql and 6.5 X 10^4 erg/cm/cm/s for alpha Cep. These are
comparable to fluxes observed in early to mid-F-type dwarfs, indicating that
significant upper atmospheric heating is present in at least some stars as hot
as ~8000 K (B-V=0.22). We find no evidence for the blue-shifted emission
reported by Simon et al (1994). We estimate the basal flux level to be about
30% of that seen in early~F stars, and that the bulk of the emission is not
basal in origin. We conclude that the basal flux level drops rapidly for B-V <
0.3, but that magnetic activity may persist to B-V as small as 0.22.

Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope of Cepheids in the Virgo
cluster imply a Hubble Constant $H_0=80\pm17$\ km/sec/Mpc. We attempt to
clarify some issues of interpretation of these results for determining the
global cosmological parameters $\Omega$ and $\Lambda$. Using the formalism of
Bayesian model comparison, the data suggest a universe with a nonzero
cosmological constant $\Lambda>0$, but vanishing curvature: $\Omega+\Lambda=1$.

The first four strings of phototubes for the AMANDA high-energy neutrino
observatory are now frozen in place at a depth of 800 to 1000 m in ice at the
South Pole. During the 1995-96 season an additional six strings will be
deployed at greater depths. Provided absorption, scattering, and refraction of
visible light are sufficiently small, the trajectory of a muon into which a
neutrino converts can be determined by using the array of phototubes to measure
the arrival times of \v{C}erenkov light emitted by the muon. To help in
deciding on the depth for implantation of the six new strings, we discuss
models of age vs depth for South Pole ice, we estimate mean free paths for
scattering from bubbles and dust as a function of depth, and we assess
distortion of light paths due to refraction at crystal boundaries and
interfaces between air-hydrate inclusions and normal ice. We conclude that the
depth interval 1600 to 1800 m will be suitably transparent for the next six
AMANDA strings and, moreover, that the interval 1600 to 2100 m will be suitably
transparent for a future 1-km$^3$ observatory except possibly in a region a few
tens of meters thick at a depth corresponding to a peak in the dust
concentration at 60 kyr BP.

The depth-dependence of bubble concentration at pressures above the
transition to the air hydrate phase and the optical scattering length due to
bubbles in deep ice at the South Pole are modeled using diffusion-growth data
from the laboratory, taking into account the dependence of age and temperature
on depth in the ice. The model fits the available data on bubbles in cores from
Vostok and Byrd and on scattering length in deep ice at the South Pole. It
explains why bubbles and air hydrate crystals co-exist in deep ice over a range
of depths as great as 800 m and predicts that at depths below $\rm \sim$ 1400 m
the AMANDA neutrino observatory at the South Pole will operate unimpaired by
light scattering from bubbles.

The mass density field in the local universe, recovered by the POTENT method
from peculiar velocities of $\sim$3000 galaxies, is compared with the density
field of optically-selected galaxies. Both density fields are smoothed with a
Gaussian filter of radius 12 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Under the assumptions of
gravitational instability and a linear biasing parameter $b\sbo$ between
optical galaxies and mass, we obtain $\beta\sbo \equiv \om^{0.6}/b\sbo = 0.74
\pm 0.13$. This result is obtained from a regression of POTENT mass density on
optical density after correcting the mass density field for systematic biases
in the velocity data and POTENT method. The error quoted is just the $1\sigma$
formal error estimated from the observed scatter in the density--density
scatterplot; it does not include the uncertainty due to cosmic scatter in the
mean density or in the biasing relation. We do not attempt a formal analysis of
the goodness of fit, but the scatter about the fit is consistent with our
estimates of the uncertainties.

Residuals of a conventional plate adjustment of 5,687 plates of the Second
Cape Photographic Catalogue (CPC2) using the Southern Reference Star (SRS)
Catalog were analyzed to search for systematic errors depending on the location
of the star images on the plate. Even after correcting for third order optical
distortion, such coordinate depending systematic errors, hereafter called field
distortion pattern (FDP), were detected which are nearly constant with respect
to plate epoch, location in the sky and apparent brightness of the stars. The
mean amplitude of these field distortions was found to be 57 milliarcseconds
(mas), which is $0.57 \ \mu m$ on a plate. Due to the favorable 4--fold overlap
observing principle of the CPC2, the effect on the mean catalog position is
only a fraction of that. But the FDP affects a block adjustment (BA) of the
entire set of data on a 100 mas level at the border of the CPC2 sky coverage. A
comparison with FDP's found in other projects was made and physical reasons for
the FDP were investigated. Publication of a new release of the CPC2 is planned
after the Hipparcos Output Catalog becomes available in 1996.

The gravitational evolution of the genus and other statistics of isodensity
contours of the density field is derived analytically in a weakly nonlinear
regime using second-order perturbation theory. The effect of final smoothing in
perturbation theory on the statistics of isodensity contours is also evaluated.
The resulting analytic expression for the genus is compared with $N$-body
numerical simulations and exhibits a good agreement.

Molecular hydrogen clouds can contribute substantially to the galactic halo<
dark matter and may lead to the birth of massive halo objects (MHOs) observed
indirectly by microlensing. We present a method to detect these molecular
clouds in the halo of M31 using the Doppler shift effect. We also consider the
possibility to directly observe MHOs in the halo of M31 via their infrared
emission.

The Sun is forced into an orbit around the barycenter of the solar system
because of the changing mass distribution of the planets. Solar-planetary-lunar
dynamic relationships may form a new basis for understanding and predicting
cyclic solar forcing functions on the Earth's climate.

We show that cosmic rays in external galaxies, groups and clusters rich in
gas, with an average flux similar to that observed in the Milky Way, could have
produced the observed extragalactic diffuse gamma radiation.

I find conditions under which the "Weak Energy Principle" of Katz, Inagaki
and Yahalom (1993) gives necessary and sufficient conditions. My conclusion is
that, necessary and sufficient conditions of stability are obtained when we
have only two mode coupling in the gyroscopic terms of the perturbed
Lagrangian. To illustrate the power of this new energy principle, I have
calculated the stability limits of two dimensional configurations such as
ordinary Maclaurin disk, an infinite self gravitating rotating sheet, and a two
dimensional Rayleigh flow which has well known sufficient conditions of
stability. All perturbations considered are in the same plane as the
configurations. The limits of stability are identical with those given by a
dynamical analysis when available, and with the results of the strong energy
principle analysis when given. Thus although the "Weak Energy" method is
mathematically more simple than the "Strong Energy" method of Katz, Inagaki and
Yahalom )1993) since it does not involve solving second order partial
differential equations, it is by no means less effective.

Interstellar matter that is accreted onto isolated magnetic neutron stars in
the Galaxy ($\sim 10^9$ by number) is accelerated and reflected back by MHD
shocks, which envelope the stars. The integrated power in the Galaxy
$L_{cr,ns}$ is $ \sgreat 10^{40} {\rm erg \ s^{-1} }$, the energy distribution
is a power law of spectral index $> 2$, and the particle energy can be raised
to $10^6$ GeV, consistent with the power and spectrum of primary cosmic rays in
the Galaxy. The major contribution for $L_{cr,ns}$ comes from a minority of
$\sim 10^7$ isolated neutron stars which are located within dense clouds.
Sources in these clouds, that are generally spread within the Galactic disk,
can explain the concentration of high-energy cosmic rays in the Galactic plane,
as deduced from pion decay spectra in gamma-ray observations. The soft X-ray
luminosity from these neutron stars is consistent with the Galactic X-ray
background. The accretion may be associated with ion-neutral bias, that is
further enhanced by ion confinement in frozen-in magnetic fields, which can
raise the relative abundance of first ionization potential (FIP) elements in
the cosmic rays.

We present an overview of what can be done in the field of star formation
using the VLT and its advanced instrumentation, and especially with the very
high angular resolution provided by the VLT in the VLTI mode. Herbig-Haro
objects and early stellar evolution, pre-main sequence binaries, circumstellar
disks and surface properties of young stars are investigated. We show that the
VLT and VISA will be not only very useful to better understand star formation
processes, but indeed necessary in order to advance in certain subjects.

Possible entropy constraints on particle acceleration spectra are discussed.
Solar flare models invoke a variety of initial distributions of the primary
energy release over the particles of the flare plasma -- ie., the partition of
the energy between thermal and nonthermal components. It is suggested that,
while this partition can take any value as far as energy is concerned, the
entropy of a particle distribution may provide a useful measure of the
likelihood of its being produced for a prescribed total energy.
  The Gibbs' entropy is calculated for several nonthermal isotropic
distribution functions $f$, for a single particle species, and compared with
that of a Maxwellian, all distributions having the same total number and energy
of particles. Speculations are made on the relevance of some of the results to
the cosmic ray power-law spectrum, on their relation to the observed frequency
distribution of nonthermal flare hard X-ray spectrum parameters and on the
additional energy release required to achieve lower entropy $f$s.

Recent morphological studies (Telles \& Terlevich 1994) of HII galaxies, i.e.
dwarf galaxies dominated by a very luminous starburst, have indicated that
luminous HII galaxies tend to show distorted morphology suggestive of tidal
interactions triggering the present starburst while low luminosity HII galaxies
tend to be instead symmetric and regular. To check the tidal origin of the
starburst in HII galaxies, we have searched for companions in the neighbourhood
of a sample of 51 HII galaxies. We found that only 12 HII galaxies have a
neighbour within a projected distance of 1 Mpc and 250 \kmsec~ in velocity
difference, and of these 12, only 4 have a luminous (M$_B <$ --19) neighbour.
Surprisingly, isolated HII galaxies tend to be of high luminosity and disturbed
morphology while HII galaxies with neighbours tend to be low luminosity regular
HII galaxies. Furthermore, the metal abundance and the equivalent width of the
emission lines in HII galaxies do not depend on the presence of a companion.
These results are opposed to simple expectations if interaction with a bright
companion is the main mechanism triggering the starbursts. We have also found a
loose group of HII galaxies with no luminous companion. For this, there is the
additional difficulty of understanding how these starbursts are synchronized on
time scales of less than $10^7$ yrs in systems separated by $\sim$ 1-2 Mpc.

We present $UBVI$ and H$\alpha$ images of a sample of Low Surface Brightness
(LSB) disk galaxies. These galaxies are generally late types, if they can be
sensibly classified at all. However, they are not dwarfs, being intrinsically
large and luminous.
  The morphology of LSB galaxies is discussed in terms of the physical
interpretation of the Hubble sequence. Galaxies with high contrast relative to
the sky background are subject to being more finely typed than those which
appear merely as fuzzy blobs on photographic plates. This causes the stages of
the Hubble sequence to be nonlinear in the sense that large morphological type
distinctions are made between high surface brightness spirals when only small
physical differences exist, and small morphological distinctions are made
between low surface brightness galaxies even when large physical differences
exist.
  Many LSB galaxies lack the old red disk conspicuous in higher surface
brightness spirals. Their morphology is strikingly similar in all bands from
$U$ to $I$, suggesting farily homogeneous stellar populations lacking a well
developed giant branch. These properties, together with their very blue colors,
suggest that LSB galaxies are relatively younger than their high surface
brightness counterparts. A few of these LSB galaxies appear to be very young
($\simlt 1$~Gyr), and as such may represent local examples of protogalaxies.

Invited review, Ringberg conference on "Galaxies in the Young Universe"
(Sept94)

When an AGN is obscured, the warm reflecting gas nearby can be seen by a
combination of bremsstrahlung, intrinsic line emission, and reflection of the
nuclear continuum, both by electron scattering and by resonance line
scattering. Resonance lines, due both to intrinsic emission and scattering, are
particularly prominent in the soft X-ray band.
  When our line of sight to the nucleus is not obscured, the dominant effect is
absorption. In the soft X-ray band, ionization edges of highly ionized species
and resonance lines contribute comparably to the opacity; in the ultraviolet,
the gas is almost transparent except for a small number of resonance lines. We
identify the "warm absorbers" seen in many AGN X-ray spectra with this gas, but
argue that most of the UV absorption lines seen must be due to a small amount
of more weakly ionized gas which is embedded in the main body of the warm,
reflecting gas. Because the ionization equilibration timescales of some ions
may be as long as the variability timescales in AGN, the ionic abundances
indicated by the transmission spectra may not be well-described by ionization
equilibrium.

Mergers between gas--rich disks and less--massive dwarf galaxies are studied
using numerical simulation. As the orbit of a satellite decays through
dynamical friction, the primary disk develops large-amplitude spirals in
response to its tidal forcing. While these features arise in both the stars and
the gas in the disk, the non--axisymmetric structures in the gas differ
slightly from those in the stars. In particular, as a consequence of the
formation of strong shocks in the gas and the effects of radiative cooling, the
gas response tends to lead the stellar response, enabling the stars to strongly
torque the gas. These torques deprive the gas of its angular momentum, forcing
a significant fraction of it into the inner regions of the disk. The radial
inflows induced by these mergers accumulate large quantities of interstellar
gas in the nuclear regions of the host disks. In some cases, nearly half of all
the gas initially distributed throughout the disk winds up in a dense ``cloud''
several hundred parsecs in extent. The models reported here do not include star
formation and, so, we cannot determine the ultimate fate of the gas.
Nevertheless, given the high densities in the nuclear gas, it is plausible to
identify these concentrations of dense gas in the remnants with those
accompanying intense starbursts in some active galaxies. Therefore, the
calculations here provide a framework for interpreting the origin of nuclear
activity in otherwise quiescent disk galaxies. To the extent that galaxy
formation is a chaotic process in which large structures are built up by the
accretion of smaller fragments, our models may also be relevant to starbursts
and the onset of nuclear activity in proto--galaxies at high redshifts.

The spectrum of the Q0055-269 ($z=3.66$) has been observed at the resolution
of 14 km s$^{-1}$ in the wavelength interval 4750--6300 \AA. The statistical
distribution of the Doppler parameter for the Ly$_\alpha$ lines is peaked at
$b\simeq 23$ km s$^{-1}$. The column density distribution is described by a
power-law with a break at $\log N_{HI} \simeq 14.5$. Significant clustering,
with $\xi \simeq 1$ at $\Delta v=100$ km s$^{-1}$, is detected for lines with
$\log N_{HI} \geq 13.8$. Two voids of size $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$ are found in
the spectrum with a probability of $2\times 10^{-4}$.

The hard X-ray spectra of accreting black holes systems are generally
well-fit by thermal Comptonization models with temperatures $\sim 100$ keV. We
demonstrate why, over many orders of magnitude in heating rate and seed photon
supply, hot plasmas radiate primarily by inverse Compton scattering, and find
equilibrium temperatures within a factor of a few of 100 keV. We also determine
quantitatively the (wide) bounds on heating rate and seed photon supply for
which this statement is true.
  Plasmas in thermal balance in this regime obey two simple scaling laws, one
relating the product of temperature and optical depth to the ratio of seed
photon luminosity to plasma heating rate $l_s/l_h$, the other relating the
spectral index of the output power-law to $l_s/l_h$. Because $\alpha$ is almost
independent of everything but $l_s/l_h$, the observed power law index may be
used to estimate $l_s/l_h$. In both AGN and stellar black holes, the mean value
estimated this way is $l_s/l_h \sim 0.1$. As a corollary, $\Theta \tau_T$ must
be $\simeq 0.1$ -- 0.2, depending on plasma geometry.

We present results of a model for the energetics of electrons accelerated by
the large electric fields generated by a rotating highly magnetized neutron
star. The energy loss mechanisms we consider in our calculations include
magnetic Compton scattering of thermal x-ray photons, triplet pair production,
and curvature radiation emission. The electron acceleration mechanism is
assumed to operate only to a height above the polar cap approximately equal to
the polar cap radius. We find several interesting results. First, magnetic
Compton scattering is the dominant energy loss process when the electron
Lorentz factors are < few x10^6 for typical gamma-ray pulsar magnetic fields
and surface temperatures measured by ROSAT. The amount of energy converted to
photons by accelerated electrons ranges from ~10% to ~100% of gamma_0 mc^2
where gamma_0 is the maximum Lorentz factor an electron can attain with no
radiative losses. We also find that if B > 10^13 G and T > 3x10^6 K, the
Lorentz factors of the electrons can be limited to values < 10^3 assuming
values for the size of the neutron star thermal polar cap comparable to the
polar cap size determined by the open field lines. Such small Lorentz factors
may be capable of explaining the gamma-ray emission from PSR 1509-58 which is
observed only at energies <1 MeV. We calculated the fraction of the electron's
kinetic energy that is converted to gamma rays for the three gamma-ray pulsars
which show thermal x-ray spectra, namely Vela (60%), Geminga (5%), and PSR
1055-52 (20%).

The PSR B1259--63 system contains a 47 ms radio pulsar in a highly eccentric
binary with a Be-star companion. Strongly time variable X-ray emission was
reported from this system as the pulsar was near apastron in 1992-early 1993.
The variability was primarily deduced from an apparent non-detection of the
\psr system during a first pre-apastron \ros observation in February~1992. We
have re-analyzed the \ros observations of the \psr system. Contrary to the
results of a previous analysis, we find that the \psr system was detected by
\ros during the first off-axis February~1992 observation. The intensity of the
soft X-ray emission of the \psr system before and after the 1992 apastron
appears to vary at most by a factor $\sim 2$. Our results sensibly constrain
theoretical models of X-ray emission from the \psr system.

We have used the CFHT REDEYE infrared camera to obtain deep J and K' images
of four fields in the globular cluster M13. The composite K, J-K
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) extends from the upper red giant branch (RGB) to
2 magnitudes below the main sequence turn-off (MSTO). Selected [Fe/H]~ -1.6
isochrones from Bergbusch & VandenBerg (1992, ApJS, 81, 163) and Straniero &
Chieffi (1991, ApJS, 76, 525) are transformed onto the near-infrared
observational plane, and these suggest an age for M13 in the range 14-16 Gyr.
We emphasize that any effort to estimate ages should be considered as tentative
given uncertainties in the input physics; however, these uncertainties
notwithstanding, comparisons between the near-infrared isochrones indicate that
age differences of order +/-2 Gyr should be detectable among metal-poor
clusters on the K, J-K plane. Building on this result, we find that the
difference in J-K color between the MSTO and the base of the RGB in M13 is the
same as in M4, and conclude that these clusters have similar ages. This
conclusion is verified by comparing (1) the K brightnesses of the MSTO, and (2)
the morphologies of optical CMDs. Finally, we investigate the mass function of
main sequence stars in M13 with distances between 3 and 6 core radii from the
cluster center. The mass functions in the interval 0.55 and 0.8 solar masses
are relatively flat, independent of radius. Optical studies at larger radii
have found non-zero mass function indices in this same mass interval, and we
attribute this radial variation in mass function morphology to dynamical
evolution.

We report the discovery with the Keck telescope of two new multiply-imaged
arcs in the luminous X-ray cluster A2219 ($z=0.225$). The brighter arc in the
field is red and we use spectroscopic and photometric information to identify
it as a $z \sim 1$ moderately star-forming system. The brightness of this arc
implies that it is formed from two merging images of the background source, and
we identify possible candidates for the third image of this source. The second
giant arc in this cluster is blue, and while fainter than the red arc it has a
similarly large angular extent (32 arcsec). This arc comprises three images of
a single nucleated source -- the relative parities of the three images are
discernible in our best resolution images. The presence of several bright
multiply imaged arcs in a single cluster allows detailed modelling of the
cluster mass distribution, especially when redshift information is available.
We present a lensing model of the cluster which explains the properties of the
various arcs, and we contrast this model with the optical and X-ray information
available on the cluster. We uncover significant differences between the
distributions of mass and X-ray gas in the cluster. We suggest that such
discrepancies may indicate an on-going merger event in the cluster core,
possibly associated with a group around the second brightest cluster member.
The preponderance of similar merger signatures in a large fraction of the
moderate redshift clusters would indicate their dynamical immaturity.

We present results from the analysis of the two EXOSAT observations of the
low mass X-ray binary (LMXRB) 4U1957+11. The 1-20keV spectrum of the source is
best fitted by a power law model with exponential cutoff, that provides an
approximation of a thermal Comptonisation spectrum. The cutoff energy (~2keV),
as well as the X-ray colours, are intermediate between those of ultrasoft
sources containing black hole candidates (BHCs) and those of soft LMXRBs
containing an old accreting neutron star. We find no evidence for a black body
spectral component. During the 1985 observation, the source flux was 10% higher
than in the 1983 observation, and the ME spectra provide evidence for a high
energy tail (up to ~16keV), which strengthens the similarity with the spectra
of high state BHCs. However the source luminosity was only ~5 10^36 ergs/s.
During the 1985 observation the GSPC spectra revealed the presence of a 100eV
EW iron K-line emission feature with a centroid energy of 7.06+/-0.09keV; this
value is among the highest measured by {\it EXOSAT}. The ME light curves showed
only a low-amplitude variability on timescales of a few hours. No evidence for
a periodic modulation with periods between 0.016 and 13000~s was found.

The nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC 1313 has been observed with the PSPC
instr- ument on board the ROSAT X-ray satellite. Ten individual sources are
found. Three sources (X-1, X-2 and X-3 [SN~1978K]) are very bright (~10^40
erg/s) and are unusual in that analogous objects do not exist in our Galaxy. We
present an X-ray image of NGC~1313 and \xray spectra for the three bright
sources. The emission from the nuclear region (R ~< 2 kpc) is dominated by
source X-1, which is located ~1 kpc north of the photometric (and dynamical)
center of NGC~1313. Optical, far-infrared and radio images do not indicate the
presence of an active galactic nucleus at that position; however, the compact
nature of the \xray source (X-1) suggests that it is an accretion-powered
object with central mass M >~ 10^3 Msun. Additional emission (L_X ~ 10^39
erg/s) in the nuclear region extends out to ~2.6 kpc and roughly follows the
spiral arms. This emission is from 4 sources with luminosity of several x 10^38
erg/s, two of which are consistent with emission from population I sources
(e.g., supernova remnants, and hot interstellar gas which has been heated by
supernova remnants). The other two sources could be emission from population II
sources (e.g., low-mass \xray binaries). The bright sources X-2 and SN~1978K
are positioned in the southern disk of NGC~1313. X-2 is variable and has no
optical counterpart brighter than 20.8 mag (V-band). It is likely that it is an
accretion-powered object in NGC~1313. The type-II supernova SN~1978K (Ryder
\etal 1993) has become extra- ordinarily luminous in X-rays $\sim$13 years
after optical maximum.

Skewness of temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
produced by initially Gaussian adiabatic perturbations with the flat
(Harrison-Zeldovich) spectrum, which arises due to non-linear corrections to a
gravitational potential at the matter-dominated stage, is calculated
quantitatively. For the standard CDM model, the effect appears to be smaller
than expected previously and lies below the cosmic variance limit even for
small angles. The sign of the skewness is opposite to that of the skewness of
density perturbations.

We present the B band Tully-Fisher relation for Low Surface Brightness (LSB)
galaxies. These LSB galaxies follow the same Tully-Fisher relation as normal
spiral galaxies. This implies that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of LSB
galaxies is typically a factor of 2 larger than that of normal galaxies of the
same total luminosity and morphological type. Since the dynamical mass of a
galaxy is related to the rotation velocity and scale length via M \propto V^2
h, at fixed linewidth LSB galaxies must be twice as large as normal galaxies.
This is confirmed by examining the relation between scale length and linewidth
for LSB and normal galaxies. The universal nature of the Tully-Fisher relation
can be understood if LSB galaxies are galaxies with low mass surface density,
\sigma. The mass surface density apparently controls the luminosity evolution
of a galaxy such as to keep the product \sigma M/L constant.

Physical principles and mathematical structure involved in deriving an
analytical representation of the internal structure of the Sun is discussed.
For a two-parameter family of a non-linear matter density distribution, the run
of mass, pressure, temperature, and luminosity throughout the Sun is presented
in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric function. The system of differential
equations governing hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation for the
spherical Sun is proved to be a laboratory for the application of special
functions.

Intra-Cluster Machos (ICMs) are a plausible candidate for at least some of
the dark matter in clusters of galaxies. ICMs can be detected by searching
toward M87 for ``pixel lensing'', gravitational microlensing of unresolved
stars. Dedicated observations by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the
{\it Hubble Space Telescope} would discover lenses at a rate $\Gamma\sim 7
f\,\rm day^{-1}$ where $f$ is the fraction of the Virgo cluster composed of
Machos (Massive Compact Objects). The only important background is lensing by
stars in M87 itself. Such self-lensing should be detected at a rate $\Gamma\sim
1\,\rm day^{-1}$. However, most of these background events should be
recognizable from their angular distribution and/or measurement of their proper
motions (which are smaller by a factor $\sim 2$ than those of ICMs). The
observations should be carried out principally in $I$, but with $V$
measurements made $\sim 20\%$ of the time in order to determine the colors of
the lensed stars. It is also possible to detect ``Class II'' lensing events
which are longer and hence for which lower signal to noise is balanced by a
much larger number of observations per event. There are $\sim 5$ times more of
these than the higher quality events. However, it is difficult to distinguish
Class II events generated by ICMs from those generated by M87 stars.

Our knowledge of galactic chemical evolution is currently limited to
observations of Milky Way stars and H II regions of nearby galaxies. Damped
Lyman~$\alpha$ systems offer a new approach for tracking the evolution of
normal galaxies from early epochs to the present day. Here we report the first
measurements of nitrogen abundances in galaxies with less than 1/100 of solar
metallicity, a range unexplored by previous observations.

Slit spectra, covering the rest frame near-ultraviolet and blue wavelength
regions, are combined with moderately deep g and R images to investigate radial
population gradients in the brightest components of six z=0.2 galaxy clusters
selected by x-ray brightness. We conclude that the brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) of the EMSS0440+02, EMSS0906+11 and EMSS1231+15 clusters have global
stellar contents resembling nearby elliptical galaxies. The BCGs in the
clusters EMSS0839+29, EMSS1455+22 and Abell2390 are complicated by ionized gas,
which is detected over large portions of all three systems. Radial color
variations are detected in the majority of galaxies and, for those systems not
showing extended [OII] emission, the weakening of D4000 (which measures the
4000 Angstrom break in magnitudes) with radius falls in the upper range of what
is seen among nearby ellipticals. However, there is no correlation between
local D4000 values and (g-r), suggesting that these quantities are sensitive to
different parameters. We estimate the metallicity sensitivity of D4000 using a
combination of observational and theoretical data, and find metallicity
gradients for BCGs which are relatively steep, and in qualitative agreement
with predictions for galaxies which experience a single monolithic dissipative
collapse. Line gradients measured with respect to g surface brightness show
excellent galaxy-to-galaxy consistency, and are in good agreement with what has
been measured in Coma cluster galaxies. The presence of significant stellar
population gradients in the BCGs suggests that the material from which they
formed experienced dissipation during the collapse phases, and it seems likely
that these galaxies could not have formed solely from the merging of gas-poor
galaxies.

A gravitational lens (GL)-search program, initiated in 1990 at the Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT), has revealed several possible GL-candidates among a
sample of 168 quasars (QSOs), chosen from three lists compiled by C. Hazard, D.
Reimers and J. Surdej, respectively. Some of these candidates, selected for
having close companions (within 5 arcseconds), were imaged in several filters
and their colours compared. Low dispersion spectra of the most promising
candidates were also obtained at the NOT and ESO New Technology Telescope
(NTT). None of these has proved to be strong candidates of gravitational
lensing effects. We present this new sample of QSOs and combine it with
previously published optical QSO samples in a statistical analysis to yield
constraints on flat cosmologies and galaxy velocity dispersions. Finally, by
simulating larger samples of quasars and gravitational lenses, we discuss how
the uncertainties affecting our present results would be changed.

Zwicky 159.034, one of the Seyfert galaxies identified with EUV sources
detected during the ROSAT Wide Field Camera (WFC) all-sky survey, has unusual
properties. The ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) 0.1--2.5
keV X-ray spectrum, obtained simultaneously with the WFC survey, appears
extremely steep. Subsequent deeper pointed observations with ROSAT revealed
that its 0.1--2.5 keV count rate had decreased by an extremely large amount (a
factor of about 70). This is comparable to the variability amplitude seen in
another ultrasoft Seyfert, E1615+061. There appears to be about 10 times as
much flux in the soft component as in any expected hard tail suggesting that,
in the absence of partial covering of the hard flux, the soft flux cannot arise
via reprocessing of the hard tail. Its peculiar optical spectrum has permitted
lines with widths about 1200--1500 km s^{-1}, and forbidden lines are weak or
absent. Its optical spectrum shows evidence for variability, and might be used
to study the role reprocessed X-rays play in the formation of optical lines.

A comparison between the CO and HI Tully-Fisher relation for a sample of 30
Virgo ga\-la\-xies shows no significant difference concerning the intrinsic
scatter. The distance moduli from both relations after correcting for the
sample incompleteness bias agree within the errors and also show no significant
difference with previous studies of the Virgo cluster using a complete sample.
The CO total linewidth and the CO flux were found to be not well correlated.
However, if the distances to the individual galaxies were calculated by the CO
Tully-Fisher relation, the CO luminosities calculated using these distances are
correlated with the CO linewidths. This correlation does not show up when the
distances were calculated by the conventional HI Tully-Fisher relation. Finally
we give the structure of the cluster as derived from this small subsample using
the distances to the individual galaxies. The large depth of the cluster is
confirmed both by the HI and the CO Tully-Fisher relation.

We present the results of a series of one-dimensional N-body and
hydrodynamical simulations which have been used for testing the different
clustering properties of baryonic and dark matter in an expanding background.
Initial Gaussian random density perturbations with a power-law spectrum $P(k)
\propto k^n$ are assumed. We analyse the distribution of density fluctuations
and thermodynamical quantities for different spectral indices $n$ and discuss
the statistical properties of clustering in the corresponding simulations. At
large scales the final distribution of the two components is very similar while
at small scales the dark matter presents a lumpiness which is not found in the
baryonic matter. The amplitude of density fluctuations in each component
depends on the spectral index $n$ and only for $n=-1$ the amplitude of baryonic
density fluctuations is larger than that in the dark component. This result is
also confirmed by the behaviour of the bias factor, defined as the ratio
between the r.m.s of baryonic and dark matter fluctuations at different scales:
while for $n=1,\ 3$ it is always less than unity except at very large scales
where it tends to one, for $n=-1$ it is above 1.4 at all scales. All
simulations show also that there is not an exact correspondence between the
positions of largest peaks in dark and baryonic components, as confirmed by a
cross-correlation analysis. The final temperatures depend on the initial
spectral index: the highest values are obtained for $n=-1$ and are in proximity
of high density regions.

Spiral arms, if they are massive, exert gravitational torques that transport
angular momentum radially within galactic disks. These torques depend not on
the pattern speed or permanence of the arms but only on the nonaxisymmetric
mass distribution. Hence the torques can be measured from photometry. We
demonstrate this using $gri$ CCD data for M100 (NGC 4321). Since we find
consistency among the three bands, we believe that dust and young stars in the
arms do not seriously bias our results. If the present epoch is representative,
the timescale for redistribution of angular momentum in M100 is $5-10$ Gyr, the
main uncertainty being the mass-to-light ratio of the disk.

It has been suggested that the peanut-shaped bulges seen in some edge-on disk
galaxies are due to the presence of a central bar. Although bars cannot be
detected photometrically in edge-on galaxies, we show that barred potentials
produce a strong kinematic signature in the form of double-peaked line-of-sight
velocity distributions with a characteristic ``figure-of-eight'' variation with
radius. We have obtained spectroscopic observations of two edge-on galaxies
with peanut-shaped bulges (NGC~5746 and NGC~5965), and they reveal exactly such
line-of-sight velocity distributions in both their gaseous (emission line) and
their stellar (absorption line) components. These observations provide strong
observational evidence that peanut-shaped bulges are a by-product of bar
formation.

We estimate the variance $\xibar_2$, the skewness $\xibar_3$ and the kurtosis
$\xibar_4$ in the distribution of density fluctuations in a complete sample
from the APM Cluster Redshift Survey with 339 clusters and a mean depth $ \sim
250\Mpc$. We are able to measure the statistics of fluctuations in spheres of
radius $R \simeq 5-80 \Mpc$, with reasonable errorbars. The statistics in the
cluster distribution follow the hierarchical pattern
$\xibar_J=S_J~\xibar_2^{J-1}$ with $S_J$ roughly constant, $S_3 \simeq 2$ and
$S_4 \sim 8$. We analyse the distribution of clusters taken from N-body
simulations of different dark matter models. The results are compared with an
alternative method of simulating clusters which uses the truncated Zel'dovich
approximation. We argue that this alternative method is not reliable enough for
making quantitative predictions of $\xibar$. The N-body simulation results
follow similar hierarchical relations to the observations, with $S_J$ almost
unaffected by redshift distortions from peculiar motions. The standard
$\Omega=1$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model is inconsistent with either the second,
third or fourth order statistics at all scales. However both a hybrid Mixed
Dark Matter model and a low density CDM variant agree with the $\xibar_J$
observations.

We compare the burst distribution of the new (2B) BATSE catalogue to a
cosmological distribution. The observed distribution agrees well with a
cosmological one, however, it is insensitive to cosmological parameters such as
$\O$ and $\Lambda$. The bursts are not necessarily standard candles and their
luminosity can vary by up to a factor of ten. The maximal red shift, $\zm$, of
bursts longer than 2 sec is $2.1^{+1.}_{-.7}$ (assuming no evolution). The
present data is insufficient to determine maximal red shift, $\zm$, of bursts
shorter than 2 sec.

We describe and test a method to quantitatively classify clusters of galaxies
according to their projected morphologies. This method will be subsequently
used to place constraints on cosmological parameters ($\Omega$ and the power
spectrum of primordial fluctuations on scales at or slightly smaller than that
of clusters) and to test theories of cluster formation. We specifically address
structure that is easily discernible in projection and dynamically important to
the cluster. The method is derived from the two-dimensional multipole expansion
of the projected gravitational potential and yields dimensionless {\it power
ratios} as morphological statistics. If the projected mass profile is used to
characterize the cluster morphology, the power ratios are directly related to
the cluster potential. However, since detailed mass profiles currently exist
for only a few clusters, we use the X-ray--emitting gas as an alternative
tracer of cluster morphology. In this case, the relation of the power ratios to
the potential is qualitatively preserved. We demonstrate the feasibility of the
method by analyzing simulated observations of simple models of X-ray clusters
using the instrument parameters of the ROSAT PSPC. For illustrative purposes,
we apply the method to ROSAT PSPC images of A85, A514, A1750, and A2029. These
clusters, which differ substantially in their X-ray morphologies, are easily
distinguished by their respective power ratios. We discuss the suitability of
this method to address the connection between cluster morphology and cosmology
and to assess whether an individual cluster is sufficiently relaxed for
analysis of its intrinsic shape using hydrostatic methods. Approximately 50
X-ray observations of Abell clusters with the PSPC will be amenable to
morphological analysis using the method of this paper.

Using Monte Carlo simulations of perturbations induced by cosmic strings on
the microwave background, we demonstrate the scale invariance of string
fluctuation patterns. By comparing string-induced fluctuation patterns with
gaussian random phase ones, we show that the non-gaussian signatures of the
string patterns are detectable by tests based on the moments of the
distributions only for angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes and for
maps based on the gradient of temperature fluctuations. However, we find that
tests of the gaussianity of the moments fail when we include a reasonable
amount of instrumental noise in a pattern. Signal to noise ratios of $3.3$ or
greater completely suppress a string pattern's non-gaussian features even at
the highest resolutions.

Numerical simulations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies undergoing several close
encounters with the Milky Way are described. By comparing our models to
observed properties of the recently discovered dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius
(Sgr), we discuss implications of our results for the formation and evolution
of the Milky Way system. We find that existing observations are not sufficient
to allow us to place precise limits on either the orbit or the initial state of
the dwarf. Debris from the ongoing tidal stripping of the Sagittarius galaxy
are expected to form moving groups in the halo of the Galaxy and the discovery
of such stars would strongly constrain the history and dynamical state of the
dwarf. Furthermore, if Sgr is presently being disrupted, we predict that its
remains will be detectable as a moving group in the halo for more than 1 Gyr.
Thus, if similar accretion events have occurred in the recent history of the
Galaxy, their aftereffects may still be observable.

Recent {\it ASCA} observations confirm the presence of X-ray absorption due
to partially ionized gas in many Seyfert 1 galaxies; the so-called warm
absorber. Constraints on the location of the warm material are presented with
the conclusion that this material lies at radii coincident with, or just
outside, the broad-line region. The stability of this warm material to isobaric
perturbations under the assumptions of thermal and photoionization equilibrium
is also studied. It is shown that there is a remarkably small range of
ionization parameter, $\xi$, for which the warm absorber state is stable. The
robustness of this result to changes in the shape of the primary continuum, the
assumed density and optical depth is investigated. Given the constraints on the
location and the stability properties of the material, several models for the
environments of Seyfert nuclei are discussed. These attempt to explain the
presence of significant amounts of partially ionized material. In particular,
various models of the broad-line region are discussed. The simple two-phase
model of the broad-line region proves to be unsatisfactory. A model of the
broad-line region is presented in which a turbulent, hot intercloud medium is
mechanically heated. Turbulent mixing layers could then give rise to warm
absorption features. Finally, a model is discussed in which the warm absorber
is due to a steady state, radiatively driven outflow.

We have found a strong absorption feature at 2598\AA~ in the spectra of two
distant radio galaxies, which we interpret as due to interstellar FeII. We
discuss this interpretation and the possibility of obtaining important
information on the evolution of the ISM in galaxies, to be compared with the
results of the study of intervening and associated absorptions in quasars.

The inferred effective temperatures (T$_{\rm eff}$) and surface gravities of
T Tauri stars (TTS) are usually contaminated by the presence of a non stellar
continuum emission (veiling) and the strong chromospheric activity
characteristic of these objects. In this work, we develop a method to determine
T$_{\rm eff}$'s and surface gravities (log$\,g$) of a group of TTS. This method
is based on the comparison between observed and theoretical molecular and
atomic line depth ratios being therefore insensitive to the influence of
veiling. We show the strong dependence of our line depth ratios upon gravity
and temperature. The resulting gravities, as expected for TTS, average between
the values of dwarf and giant stars. Previously published gravities for each of
our stars vary widely due in part to the differences in the adopted visual
extinction, veiling (if ever considered) and methods of assessing the stellar
luminosity. Our values of T$_{\rm eff}$ and log$\,g$ have the uniqueness of
being entirely derived from high resolution data and are not affected by
circumstellar extinction or veiling when line ratios are used. They therefore
serve as more reliable input parameters for future spectral synthesis analyses
of T Tauri Stars requiring model atmospheres. We provide a table relating
theoretical line depth ratio with T$_{\rm eff}$ and log $\,g$ for easy
assessment of TTS fundamental parameters.

A brief outline of the current status of CMB anisotropies and what they might
mean, heavily biased towards the perspective of Berkeley theorists. Based on a
talk presented at the 17th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics held in
Munich, December 1994.

The power spectrum estimated from a galaxy redshift survey is the real
spectrum convolved with a window function, so when estimating the power on very
large scales (for small k), it is important that this window function be as
narrow as possible. A method that achieves this is presented. The optimal
estimate of P(k) is found to be the Fourier transform of the number density
fluctuations (n/nbar - 1) weighted by a function psi_0, and the optimal psi_0
is found to be the ground-state solution of the Schoedinger equation, with the
inverse selection function as the potential. This quantum mechanics analogy
occurs basically because we want the weight function to be narrow both in
Fourier space (to give a narrow window) and in real space (to minimize the
variance from shot noise). An optimal method for averaging the estimates at
different k-vectors is also presented, generalizing the standard procedure of
averaging over shells in k-space. Finally, a discrete version of the method is
presented, dividing space into ``fuzzy pixels", which has the advantage of
being able to handle redshift distortions in a straightforward way.

SPH hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of galaxies are presented
including the effects of an UV background radiation field. Based on a talk
presented at the 17th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics held in
Munich, December 1994.

Cold optically thick accretion disks with hot coronae and radial advection
have been investigated. Within the framework of $\alpha$-viscosity models, we
assume that all the mass accretion and angular momentum transport take place in
the cold disk, but that a fraction of the gravitational energy released is
dissipated in the corona. Both the coronal energy dissipation and the advection
heat transport have a stabilization effect on the thermal and viscous
instabilities of the disk. If that more than $\sim 95$ percent of the total
power is dissipated in the corona, then the locally unstable behavior of the
disk is restricted to a relatively narrow spatial region and is found to lie in
a small range of mass accretion rates. The global temporal variability of the
disk can be very mild or may disappear, and which may be applicable to the
low-frequency ($\sim 0.04$~Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations observed in black
hole candidates Cyg X--1 and GRO J0422+32.

We provide a unified description of thermal equilibria of black hole
accretion disks, including the newly-discovered advection-dominated solutions.
We classify the solutions on the basis of optical depth and importance of
advection cooling. We demonstrate that only four physically distinct
topological types of equilibria exist. Two of the types correspond to optically
thin and optically thick equilibria, while the other two types are
distinguished by whether advection is negligible or dominant. A stable
Shakura-Sunyaev disk exists only for accretion rates $\dot M$ below a certain
maximum. However, there is a critical viscosity parameter $\alpha_{\rm crit}$,
which is a function of radius, such that for $\alpha>\alpha_{\rm crit}$
advection-dominated solutions exist for all $\dot M$. Even when $\alpha<
\alpha_{\rm crit}$, the advection-dominated solutions are available for a wide
range of $\dot M$ except for a gap around the Eddington rate. We therefore
suggest that advection-dominated flows may be more common than standard thin
disks in black hole systems. For certain ranges of radii and $\dot M$, no
stable steady state solution is possible. In these cases, we suggest that limit
cycle behavior may occur, leading to variability.

A re-analysis of Lauer \& Postman's (1994; LP) finding that the Abell cluster
inertial frame (ACIF), defined by the 119 Abell clusters within 15,000 km/s, is
moving at almost 700 km/s with respect to the cosmic microwave background. Such
a motion is inconsistent with most cosmological models at a confidence level of
95% or higher. We obtain an exact expression for a cluster's peculiar velocity
in terms of the residual magnitude about the mean relation between the metric
luminosity of brightest cluster galaxies and the slope of their luminosity
profiles. We compare this to the approximation used by LP. We develop a maximum
likelihood procedure for recovering the Local Group motion from the scatter in
this relation which yields an unbiased estimate for the motion with
significantly smaller uncertainties than LP's method. We re-analyse LP's data
and find that the Local Group is moving relative to the ACIF at 626 (+/-242)
km/s towards l=216, b=-28 (+/-20). This implies that the ACIF is itself moving
relative to the cosmic microwave background at 764 (+/-160) km/s towards l=341,
b=49 (+/-20). This motion is consistent with that derived by LP but has a 10%
larger amplitude and 20% smaller errors, making it even harder to reconcile
with cosmological models.

We use the moments of counts of neighbors as given by the Generalized
Correlation Integrals, to study the clustering properties of Dark Matter Halos
(DH) in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Cold+Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) models. We
compare the results with those found in the CfA and SSRS galaxy catalogs. We
show that if we apply the analysis in redshift space, both models reproduce
equally well the observed clustering of galaxies. Mass segregation is also
found in the models: more massive DHs are more clustered compared with less
massive ones. In redshift space, this mass segregation is reduced by a factor
2-3 due to the peculiar velocities. Observational catalogs give an indication
of luminosity and size segregation, which is consistent with the predictions of
the models. Because the mass segregation is smaller in redshift space, it is
suggestive that the real luminosity or size segregation of galaxies could be
significantly larger than what it is found in redshift catalogs.

We have computed 8, 10, and 12 Gyr isochrones and physically consistent
models of zero-age red horizontal branch stars for stellar masses between 0.55
and 1.3~\msun, all at [Fe/H] $=+0.15$. Comparison to the NGC 6791 BVI
photometry of Ka{\l}u\.zny & Udalski (1992) and Montgomery, Janes & Phelps
(1994) yields an age of $10.0\pm0.5$ Gyr at an apparent distance modulus $
13.49 < \dmv < 13.70$. The color offsets required to fit the isochrones,
combined with the spectroscopic results of Friel & Janes, imply that the
foreground reddening to NGC 6791 lies in the range $0.24 > \ebv >0.19$ with
$+0.27 <$ [Fe/H] $<+0.44$.
  The zero-age horizontal branch models suggest that the red horizontal branch
stars of NGC 6791 have masses $\lesssim 0.7\msun$. The masses are similar to
those found for M67 red clump stars by Tripicco, Dorman & Bell (1993) and for
globular cluster red horizontal branch stars, despite higher and lower masses
(respectively) in those cases. This suggests the presence of a mechanism that
tends to reduce stellar envelopes on the zero-age horizontal branch {\it to} a
given mass rather than {\it by} a given amount.

A brief review is given of neutrino emission processes in dense matter, with
particular emphasis on recent developments. These include direct Urca processes
for nucleons and hyperons, which can give rise to rapid energy loss from the
stellar core without exotic matter, and the effect of band structure on
neutrino bremsstrahlung from electrons in the crust, which results in much
lower energy losses by this process than had previously been estimated.

Hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation determine the conditions in
the gravitationally stabilized solar fusion reactor. We assume a matter density
distribution varying non- linearly through the central region of the Sun. The
analytic solutions of the differential equations of mass conservation,
hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy conservation, together with the equation of
state of the perfect gas and a nuclear energy generation rate
$\epsilon=\epsilon_0\rho^nT^m$, are given in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric
function. This model for the structure of the Sun gives the run of density,
mass pressure, temperature, and nuclear energy generation through the central
region of the Sun. Because of the assumption of a matter density distribution,
the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and energy conservation are separated
from the mode of energy transport in the Sun.

We present the redshifts of the galaxies and galaxy clusters which form the
Edinburgh--Milano (EM) cluster redshift survey. A total of 777 galaxy redshifts
have been measured in 94 clusters extracted from the digitised Edinburgh Durham
Cluster Catalogue. We also present the radial velocity dispersions for 37
clusters. Observational and data reduction techniques are discussed in detail,
together with the strategy adopted to determine the mean redshift of a cluster
and to identify and discard plausible phantom clusters. Some 10% of our
clusters show heavy contamination, indicating that projection is a serious
problem for optically selected rich clusters. The median velocity dispersion
estimated for a sub--sample of richness R \geq 1 clusters is 742 \pm63 km/sec
From a simple comparison with Omega=1 Cold Dark Matter models of structure
formation, these results favour a biasing parameter b=1.6-2.0 and are
inconsistent with a bias outside of the range b=1.3-2.5.

From the Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic Database LEDA, we constructed a sample of
27,000 galaxies with radial velocities smaller than 15,000 km s$^{-1}$. From
this first sample we selected the 5,683 largest galaxies which constitute a
sample complete up to the diameter limit $D_{25}=1.6'$. This sub-sample has
been used to search for the most populated plane. The result is that the plane
defined by the pole ($l=52 \deg$; $b=16 \deg$) contains twice as many galaxies
as would be found for randomly distributed galaxies. This plane is not far from
the supergalactic plane. Then, the distribution of galaxies is studied in this
plane by using the radial velocity as an estimate of the distance. An excess of
galaxies appears at a distance of about 70 Mpc. We discuss the reality of this
density enhancement which could result from selection effects.

The isotope shift between singly-charged ^<151>Eu and ^<153>Eu in the
4f^7(^8S^o)6s^9S_4-4f^7(^8S^o)6p_1/2>(J=4) transition at 4129 A has been
measured using fast ion beam-laser technique. This Eu line has attracted
interest in connection with efforts of obtaining a cosmochronometer based on
observed Th/Eu abundance ratios. Knowledge of the isotope shift is of
importance in order to check that contaminations from line blends do not
contribute to the line intensity of Eu II. The measured value of the isotope
shift -0.1527(2) cm-1 (= -4578 MHz) is consistent with the old spectroscopic
value of Krebs and Winkler -0.1503(25) cm-1 using a Fabry Perot interferometer,
while the accuracy is improved substantially.

A recently discovered inverse correlation between QSO redshift and long-term
continuum variability timescales was suggested to be the signature of
microlensing on cosmological scales (Hawkins 1993). A general theoretical
method for calculating such correlations is presented and applied to various
lensing scenarios in the framework of $\Lambda = 0$ Friedmann cosmologies. It
is shown that the observed timescales can be strongly influenced by the
observational limitations: the finite duration of the monitoring campaign and
the finite photometric sensitivity. In most scenarios the timescales increase
with source redshift, $z_s$, although slower than the $1+z_s$ time dilation
expected of intrinsic variability. A decrease can be obtained for an extended
source observed with moderate sensitivity. In this case, only lenses no further
away than several hundreds Mpc participate in the lensing. The resulting
optical depth is too small to explain the common long-term QSO variability
unless an extremely high local lens density is assumed. These results do not
support the idea that the reported inverse correlation can be attributed to
microlensing of a uniform QSO sample by a uniform distribution of lenses. The
possibility of using observations at various wavelengths and QSO samples at
various positions to identify microlensing in QSO variability is also
discussed.

The minimum mass ratio for tidal stability of a contact binary containing two
unevolved main-sequence stars is calculated to be $\qmin\simeq0.09$ in the case
of a mostly radiative primary, and is higher if an appreciable fraction of the
mass lies in a convective envelope. At least one observed system, AW UMa, has a
mass ratio just below this value ($q=0.075$), implying, if the system is
stable, that the primary must be slightly evolved and must have a very shallow
convective envelope. Contact binaries with mass ratios significantly below that
of AW UMa should not be observed, since they are tidally unstable and quickly
merge into a single, rapidly rotating object, on a timescale
$\sim10^3$--$10^4\,$yr.

Nucleosynthesis in the standard hot big bang cosmology offers a successful
account of the production of the light nuclides during the early evolution of
the Universe. Consistency among the predicted and observed abundances of D,
$^3$He, \hel4 and \li7 leads to restrictive lower and upper bounds to the
present density of nucleons. In particular, the upper bound ensures that
nucleons cannot account for more than a small fraction $(<0.06 h{^{-2} _{50}})$
of the mass in a critical density (Einstein-de Sitter) Universe. In contrast,
x-ray observations of rich clusters of galaxies suggest strongly that baryons
(in hot gas) contribute a significant fraction of the total cluster mass $(\ge
0.2 h{^{-3/2} _{50}})$. If, indeed, clusters do provide a ``fair" sample of the
mass in the Universe, this ``crisis" forces us to consider other ways of
mitigating it, including the politically incorrect possibility that $\Omega <
1$. The options, including magnetic or turbulent pressure, clumping, and
non-zero space curvature and/or cosmological constant, are discussed.

A new method for estimating the power spectrum $C_l$ from cosmic microwave
background (CMB) maps was recently presented by the author and applied to the 2
year COBE data. It was found that the spectral resolution $\Delta l$ for COBE
could be more than doubled at $l=15$, thereby revealing previously unresolved
features in the power spectrum. Whereas that paper was rather technical, the
present paper shows that all qualitative features of this method can be
understood from a simple analogy with quantum mechanics.

New optical and NIR K-band images of the inner 3 kpc region of the nearby
Virgo spiral M100 (NGC 4321) display remarkable morphological changes with
wavelength. While in the optical the light is dominated by a circumnuclear zone
of enhanced star formation, the features in the 2.2\mum image correspond to a
newly discovered kpc-size stellar bar, and a pair of leading arms situated
inside an ovally-shaped region. Only 5% of the K flux is emitted in
antisymmetric structures. This indicates that the morphology seen in the NIR is
dominated by a global density wave. Making a first-order correction for the
presence of localized dust extinction in K using the I-K image, we find that
the observed leading arm morphology is slightly hidden by dust. Possible
mechanisms responsible for the optical and NIR morphology are discussed, and
tests are proposed to discriminate between them. Conclusions are supported with
an evolutionary stellar population model reproducing the optical and NIR colors
in a number of star forming zones. We argue that this morphology is compatible
with the presence of a pair of inner Lindblad resonances in the region, and
show this explicitly in an accompanying paper by detailed numerical modeling.
The observed phenomena may provide insight into physical processes leading to
central activity in galaxies.

The three papers summarize the methods employed by the COBE-DMR group to
analyze the power spectrum of the two-year DMR anisotropy maps. Results for the
slope and normalization of the power spectrum are presented and compared. The
implications of these results for various dark matter-based structure formation
models are also discussed.

The two-year COBE-DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps in both ecliptic and galactic
coordinates, are used to determine the normalisation of inflationary, flat,
dark matter dominated universe models. The appropriately normalized cold and
mixed dark matter models, computed for a range of values of Omega_baryon and h,
and several values of the hot to cold dark matter abundance ratio, are then
compared to various measures of structure in the universe.

Fourier analysis on a cut sky of the two-year COBE DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps
(in galactic coordinates) is used to determine the normalisation of an open
inflation model based on the cold dark matter scenario. The normalised model is
compared to measures of large-scale structure in the universe. Although the DMR
data alone does not provide sufficient discriminative power to prefer a
particular value of the mass density parameter, the open model appears to be
reasonably consistent with observations when Omega_0 ~ 0.3 - 0.4 and merits
further study.

The two-year COBE-DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps are used to determine the
normalization of inflationary, cosmological constant dominated, cold dark
matter models. Although the COBE-DMR data prefer a nearly critical value for
the total density, low-density models with Omega_0 > 0.15 can not be rejected
at a confidence level > 95%. We compare theoretical predictions for various
large scale statistics, computed for a range of values of Omega_0 and h=0.5, or
0.8, to various measures of structure in the universe.

An observational survey of stars selected from the region of sky in the
direction of the Galactic bulge is presented. We discuss the choice of tracer
populations for this study. Digitised UK Schmidt plate photometry, calibrated
with CCD photometry, is obtained in 18 regions over the bulge. Stars are
selected for spectroscopic follow-up from within a carefully chosen
colour-magnitude selection window, optimised for efficient detection of bulge K
giants. Some 1500 stellar spectra were obtained, with the AAT AUTOFIB facility,
giving the largest data set yet obtained in this region of the Galaxy, by a
factor of $\approx 10$. We have derived a radial velocity and metallicity for
each star, and have quantified the uncertainties in these measurements.
Luminosity classification has been derived both by visual classification and
using an automated routine based on Principal Component Analysis. There are two
basic results from this survey: the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,
which is described by Ibata, Gilmore & Irwin (1994,1995), and a study of the
Galactic Bulge, which is presented in an accompanying paper (Ibata & Gilmore
1995).

We analyse velocity, chemical abundance and spatial distribution data for
some 1500 K- and M- giants in the Galactic Bulge. The bulge has a
well-determined linear rotation curve over the range $\rm 700pc \le R \le
3500pc$ with amplitude ${\rm \sim 25 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}}$. The oblate isotropic
bulge model of Kent (1992) is in reasonable agreement with our data. We do not
find a significant requirement for asymmetry or a bar. The metallicity
distribution of K giants in a subset of our fields, using the Mg$b$ feature,
has mean ${\rm [Fe/H] \approx -0.3}$ with no variation. That is, there is no
detectable abundance gradient in the Galactic bulge over the galactocentric
range $\rm 500pc \le R_{GC} \le 3500pc$. We derive the distribution function of
specific angular momentum for the bulge from our data, and compare it with
determinations for the halo, the thick disk and the thin disk from Wyse &
Gilmore (1992). We confirm that the bulge and the halo have angular momentum
distributions which are indistinguishable, as do the thick disk and the thin
disk. The bulge-halo distribution is however very different from the thick
disk-thin disk distribution. This is perhaps the strongest available clue to
the evolutionary relationships between different Galactic structural
components.

We have obtained infrared spectra of the star suggested to be the counterpart
of the soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) 1806-20. We found strong emission lines
similar to those seen in the spectra of the rare Luminous Blue Variables and
B[e] stars. A He I absorption line is also seen, from which we infer a spectral
type O9--B2. This classification, in combination with the minimum distance of
$\simgt6$ kpc inferred from its extinction, makes the star one of the most
luminous in the Galaxy. We infer that it is a companion to SGR 1806-20, and
suggest that the presence of a companion is somehow related to the SGR
phenomenon.

We examine the outer structure of 12 Galactic globular clusters using
star-count analyses. Deep, two-color, photographic photometry is used to select
and count stars with colors and magnitudes consistent with cluster-specific,
color-magnitude sequences. The resulting reduction in the number of
contaminating foreground stars allows us to push the star counts to
significantly lower surface densities than has previously been possible. We
find that most of our sample clusters show extra-tidal wings in their surface
density profiles. The form of the surface density profiles is consistent with
recent numerical studies of the tidal stripping of globular clusters.
Two-dimensional surface density maps for several clusters are consistent with
the expected appearance of tidal tails, with allowance for the effects of orbit
shape, orbital phase, and orientation of our line of sight. We identify the
extra-tidal material with stars which are still in the process of being removed
from the clusters. The extra-tidal stars effectively limit the accuracy to
which we can resolve the ``tidal'' radii of globular clusters. However, by
tracing the orbital paths of their parent clusters, these stars may also
facilitate a renewed attack on the problem of determining globular cluster
orbits and the shape of the Galactic potential field.

We show that viscous, transonic accretion disks which start with
sub-Keplerian angular momentum at the outer boundary reproduce the features of
the so-called thick, thin, slim and other accretion disk models depending upon
the accretion rates and viscosity parameters. These disks are advection
dominated in the pre-shock region and rotation dominated in the post-shock
region when viscosity is less than a critical value. For a higher viscosity the
shock disappears, and the flow has significant radial velocity only close to
the black hole.

The general idea of determining cosmological parameters with gravitational
lensing statistics is outlined, and then recent work---with an emphasis on
applicability to all cosmological models, observational bias, better statistics
and robustness testing through numerical simulations---is discussed with
relevance to a scheme originally introduced by Kochanek to avoid some of the
uncertainties which plague other methods. The main result is that the
observations at present---and probably in the future as well---are more
indicative of intrinsic scatter than a hint of the correct cosmological model.

The need for high dynamic range imaging is crucial in many astronomical
fields, such as extra-solar planet direct detection, extra-galactic science and
circumstellar imaging. Using a high quality coronograph, dynamic ranges of up
to $10^{5}$ have been achieved. However the ultimate limitations of
coronographs do not come from their optical performances, but from scattering
due to imperfections in the optical surfaces of the collecting system. We
propose to use a deformable mirror to correct these imperfections and decrease
the scattering level in local regions called ``dark holes''. Using this
technique will enable imaging of fields with dynamic ranges exceeding $10^8$.
We show that the dark-hole algorithm results in a lower scattering level than
simply minimizing the RMS figure error (maximum-strehl-ratio algorithm). The
achievable scattering level inside the dark-hole region will depend on the
number of mirror actuators, the surface quality of the telescope, the
single-actuator influence function and the observing wavelength. We have
simulated cases with a $37\times37$ deformable mirror using data from the {\it
Hubble Space Telescope\/} optics without spherical aberrations and have
demonstrated dark holes with rectangular and annular shapes. We also present a
preliminary concept of a monolithic, fully integrated, high density deformable
mirror which can be used for this type of space application.

After reviewing the multifrequency behaviour of the Isolated Neutron Stars
detected so far, we analyze for each object the efficiency of conversion of the
star's rotational energy loss into optical, X and gamma radiation. Although the
number of pulsars detected at different wavelengths is rather limited, a
pattern is seen to emerge from our analysis pointing towards the period
derivative as the leading parameter to describe the multifrequency emission of
INS. One object in particular, PSR 1509-58, stands out as archetypal for the
Pdot-dependence of its luminosity at different wavelengths.

We present the results of a ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter
observation of the variable radio star \ls. The source has a power law spectrum
with photon index 1.1 +/- 0.3 and a luminosity of 5.9 x 10^{33} erg/s in the
0.1 -2.4 keV range. Variability on a timescale of days is clearly visible in
the ROSAT data, but no periodic pulsations have been detected. The low X--ray
luminosity is difficult to explain in the context of the models involving super
Eddington accretion which have been proposed to account for the non thermal
radio outbursts. Though the weak X--ray flux is marginally compatible with the
levels expected from normal B and Be star winds, the variability and the rather
hard spectrum are more suggestive of non thermal emission. This might originate
in a shocked region produced by a young pulsar in orbit around the Be star.

Observations with the PC2 CCD of the Hubble Space Telescope are described of
two bright QSOs of redshift ~0.3. 1403+434 is IR-bright and radio-quiet, and
2201+315 is radio-loud with extended structure. Exposures were taken with the
F702W and F555W filters. The images are deconvolved on their own and combined
with 0.5 arcsec ground-based images. Both host galaxies have the form and
luminosity of bright ellipticals, with nuclei of 1-2 times higher luminosity.
1403+434 is strongly interacting while 2201+315 may be in later stages of a
merger, both with a smaller companion. Both host galaxies have compact knots
and other small-scale peculiar features. Some general remarks are made based on
the total program sample of 6 QSOs.

A novel explanation for the origin of the cometary globules within NGC 7293
(the "Helix" planetary nebula) is examined; that these globules originate as
massive cometary bodies at large astrocentric radii. The mass of such
hypothetical cometary bodies would have to be several orders of magnitude
larger than any such bodies observed in our solar system in order to supply the
observed mass of neutral gas. It is however shown that comets at "outer Oort
cloud" like distances are likely to survive past the red giant and asymptotic
giant branch evolutionary phases of the central star, allowing them to survive
until the formation of the planetary nebula. Some observational tests of this
hypothesis are proposed.

Measurements of element abundances in damped Lyman alpha systems are
providing new means to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies,
particularly at early times. We review progress in this area, concentrating on
recent efforts to extend the range of existing surveys to both higher and lower
redshifts.

In this work, we analyse the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave
background radiation observed by COBE and show that the distribution can be
fitted by a fractal distribution with a fractal dimension $ D= 1.43 \pm 0.07 $.
This value is in close agreement with the fractal dimension obtained by Coleman
and Pietronero (1992) and Luo and Schramm (1992) from galaxy-galaxy and
cluster-cluster correlations up to $ \sim 100 h^{-1} Mpc$. The fact that the
observed temperature fluctuations correspond to scales much larger than $ 100
h^{-1} Mpc$ and are signatures of the primordial density fluctuations at the
recombination layer suggests that the structure of the matter at the early
universe was already fractal and thus non-homogeneous on those scales. This
result may have important consequences for the theoretical framework that
describes the universe.

We describe the effects of both magnetic buoyancy and differential rotation
on a disc of isothermal gas embedded in a purely azimuthal magnetic field, in
order to study the evolution and interplay of Parker and shearing
instabilities. Both instabilities occur on the slow MHD branch of the
dispersion relation, and can affect the same waves. We put a stress on the
natural polarization properties of the slow MHD waves to get a better
understanding of the physics involved. The mechanism of the shearing
instability is described in details. Waves with a vertical wavelength shorter
than the scale height of the disc are subject to both the Parker and the
transient shearing instabilities. They occur in different ranges of radial
wavenumbers, \ie at different times in the shearing evolution ; these ranges
can overlap or, on the contrary, be separated by a phase of wave-like
oscillations, depending on the strength of differential rotation. Our results
can be applied to both galactic and accretion discs.

We present here results of stellar evolution calculations that include the
latest advances in radiative opacities and neutrino cooling, and discuss on the
basis of these models how the internal stellar structure responds to mass-loss
from the stellar surface. This problem has particular importance for the
development of semi-analytical algorithms for effi cient calculation of
synthetic stellar populations with realistic (and hence complex) mass-loss
scenarios. We therefore compare our numerical results with test calculations
based on a semi-analytical stellar evolution method developed by us. Although
small, but important, differences between results from the two methods are
revealed, the evolutionary tracks in the HR-diagram predicted by the two
approaches are almost identical.

We describe methods for setting up self-consistent disk-bulge-halo galaxy
models. The bulge and halo distribution functions (\df) are functions of $E$
and $L_z$ only. The halo's flattening and rotation can be specified. The disk
\df\ is a function of $E$ and $L_z$ and a third ``integral'', $E_z$, the
vertical energy, which is approximately conserved in a warm disk with vertical
extent. The models also have finite extent making them suitable for N-body
simulation. A simulation of a sample model shows that in practice the models
are very close to equilibrium making them ideal for experiments on
instabilities in galactic disks. We also present a sequence of models closely
resembling the Milky Way mass distribution with 5 exponential scale radii and
varying halo mass and radial extent.

We consider the lifecycle of dust introduced into the hot interstellar medium
in isolated elliptical galaxies. Dust grains are ejected into galactic-scale
cooling flows in large ellipticals by normal mass loss from evolving red
giants. Newly introduced dust rapidly enters the hot gas environment and is
sputtered away by thermal collisions with ions. Before the grains are
completely sputtered away, they emit prodigious amounts of infrared radiation
which may contribute to the large far infrared luminosities observed in
ellipticals. In order to study the global properties of grains in ellipticals
we construct a new series of King-type galactic models which are consistent
with the fundamental plane, galactic mass to light ratios and other relevant
observational correlations. We describe a new ``continuity'' procedure to
construct simple time-dependent gas dynamic models for cooling flows. In all
galaxy models, although grains can flow a considerable distance from their
radius of origin before being sputtered away, the grain size distribution is
accurately determined by assuming {\it in situ} sputtering, completely ignoring
advection. The dominant source of grain heating is absorption of starlight;
grain heating by collisions with energetic thermal electrons or X-ray
absorption are negligible. However, we also show that when self-consistent
grain sputtering is included the dust-to-gas ratio is reduced and radiative
cooling, not electron-grain interactions dominates plasma cooling, even for the
most massive ellipticals.

We investigate the distance-redshift relation in the simple void model. As
discussed by Moffat and Tatarski, if the observer stays at the center of the
void, the observed Hubble parameter is not so different from the background
Hubble parameter. However, if the position of observer is off center of the
void, we must consider the peculiar velocity correction which is measured by
the observed dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background. This peculiar
velocity correction for the redshift is crucial to determine the Hubble
parameter and we shall discuss this effect. Further the results of Turner et al
by the N-body simulation will be also considered.

The global structure of optically thin hot accretion disks with radial
advection included has been investigated. We solve the full energy conservation
equation explicitly and construct the radial structure of the disk. It is found
that advection is a real cooling process and that there are two solutions
co-exist for a given mass accretion rate less than a critical limit. One is
fully advection cooling dominated and the other is dominated by local radiative
cooling. The advection dominated accretion disks are hotter than the local
cooling dominated disks; they are most probably in the two-temperature regime
and effects such as electron-positron pair production and annihilation may need
to be considered to study the microphysics of the hot plasma. However, the
global disk structure will not be much affected by the local radiative process.

We report the investigation of spatial distribution of quasars using two
different methods: the statistical study by means of 2-point correlation
function and direct search for structures such as previously reported Large
Quasar Groups. Having analyzed the combined sample of eight homogeneous quasar
surveys (totalling near 2200 objects), we detected strong clustering at scales
$r\leq 20h^{-1}$ Mpc ($H_0=100h$ and $q_0=0.5$) which seems, however, to be
redshift dependent. Using reasonable selection criteria we have also sought for
Large Quasar Groups (LQG) similar to those which were earlier found
observationally. We discuss the properties of the detected groups and their
implications for cosmology. We also discuss the suitability of the present data
for getting the reliable statistical inference on quasar clustering.

We propose that cooling outflows from star-forming dwarf galaxies that are
spatially correlated with but unbound to bright galaxies may account for the
low column QSO Ly$\alpha$ forests, providing an explanation for both the heavy
elements recently detected in them and the large sizes associated with them.
Thus, we suggest that structure formations in the early universe on scales
where matters collapse gravitationally and the gas forms stars are responsible
for the Ly$\alpha$ forests (cf. the mini-halo model). Supernovae shock the
interstellar gas to high temperature, and the resulting gas outflows from the
dwarfs owing to their shallow potential wells. The gas cools radiatively as the
radiative cooling time shortens because of adiabatic expansion. Subsequent
thermal instability results in condensation of clouds. The clouds inherit the
kinetic energy of the flow and coast to large distances, providing regions of
the absorbing gas with sizes of up to hundreds of kpc. We calculate the
Ly$\alpha$ absorption line profiles and the neutral column distribution, and
show that they are consistent with observations. We suggest that the Ly$\alpha$
forests are caused by the faint blue galaxies found in the deep extragalactic
surveys.

We address several issues regarding the interpretation of galactic \ggg-ray
sources. We consider powerful pulsars in binaries producing X-ray and gamma-ray
{\it unpulsed} emission from the shock interaction of relativistic pulsar winds
with circumbinary material. Nebular mass outflows from companion stars of
binary pulsars can provide the right {\it calorimeters} to transform a fraction
of the electromagnetic and kinetic energy of pulsar winds into high energy
radiation. We discuss the physics of interaction of relativistic pulsar winds
with gaseous material and show that the conditions in pulsar binary systems
might be ideal to constrain shock acceleration mechanisms and pulsar wind
composition and structure. We briefly discuss the example of the 47~ms pulsar
PSR~1259-63 orbiting around a massive Be~star companion and monitored by X-ray
and gamma-ray instruments during its recent periastron passage. In addition to
young pulsars in massive binaries, also a class of recycled millisecond pulsars
in low-mass binaries can be interesting high energy emitters.

We have identified a small globular cluster in M31 located approximately 4
arcseconds northwest of the M31 globular cluster G185. While several multiple
globular clusters have been observed in the Magellanic Clouds none have been
found in the Galaxy or in M31. We estimate the probability of such a chance
line-of-sight alignment occuring near the nucleus of M31 to be 0.09 +/- 0.03
and find no obvious indication of any tidal deformation in either cluster, as
would be expected if the clusters were interacting.
  Two-dimensional modelling suggests G185 has a King (1966) [AJ, 71, 64]
concentration of c = 1.11 +/- 0.08 while the companion has c = 0.67 +/- 0.17
and is physically smaller than G185. Both objects have integrated dereddened
colors similar to those of Galactic globular clusters.

We explore the signature of a cold dark matter compensated void in the quasi
non-linear regime. We find that this void is entirely a cold spot on the
microwave background, in contrast to a non-linear void. On the last scattering
surface(LSS), it appears as either a hot or cold spot depending on where this
surface cuts the void. In addition, because the usual cancellations do not
occur, the void's LSS signature can be very large as it is proportional to
$R/H^{-1}$ rather than $(R/H^{-1})^3$. This implies strict limits for voids on
the LSS.

We examine how accretion on to T Tauri stars may be modulated by a
time-dependent `magnetic gate' where the inner edge of the accretion disc is
disrupted by a varying stellar field. We show that magnetic field variations on
time-scales shorter than 10^5 yr can modulate the accretion flow, thus
providing a possible mechanism both for the marked photometric variability of T
Tauri stars and for the possible conversion of T Tauri stars between classical
and weak line status. We thus suggest that archival data relating to the
spectrophotometric variability of T Tauri stars may provide an indirect record
of magnetic activity cycles in low-mass pre-main-sequence stars.

We present a series of four simulations of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Cold +
Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) cosmologies. We discuss the power spectrum and
correlation functions in real and redshift space, with comparisons to the CfA2
and IRAS redshift data, the pairwise velocity of galaxies, and the distribution
of hot and cold particles in CHDM simulations. We confirm that CHDM with
cold/hot/baryon density ratios $\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b= 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is a
good fit to a wide variety of present-epoch data, much better than CDM. In
particular, with reasonable assumptions about identification of galaxies and
biasing, we find that the power spectrum agrees rather well with both the CfA2
and IRAS power specta in both the nonlinear and linear regimes. New CHDM models
(e.g., with $\Omega_\nu=0.2$ or with two massive neutrinos) predict a
significantly larger rate of formation of galaxies at high redshift, which may
be needed to explain some observational data. At the same time, the difference
between the variants is rather small at $z=0$. The results presented in this
paper are interesting for two purposes: (i) For a comparison with other classes
of models (like CDM and $\Lambda$CDM) at $z=0$.(ii) As a reference point for
comparison between different variants of the CHDM model.

We use the Zel'dovich approximation and another analytical approximation to
calculate the evolution under gravitational instability of the underdense
regions of a photoionized intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that over most of
the spectrum of a quasar, the optical depth to $\lya$ scattering originates
from gas in underdense regions, or voids. This causes the ratio of the median
Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption to the value for a uniform medium containing all
the baryons in the universe to be very small, and to decrease as gravitational
collapse proceeds. We apply our calculations to the observations of the
intensity distribution in a $z=4.11$ quasar by Webb and coworkers. We show that
if $\lya$ clouds arise from gravitational collapse, their observations must be
interpreted as the first detection of the (fluctuating) GP effect, with a
median value $\tau_{GP}\simeq 0.06$ at $z=4$. For typical low-density
($\Omega\sim 0.4$) cosmological models, this is consistent with the predicted
baryon density from primordial nucleosynthesis, and the intensity of the
ionizing background derived from the proximity effect. From the numerical
simulations of Cen \etal, such models also predict correctly the number of
$\lya$ absorption lines observed.

The nucleus of M31 may be a thick eccentric disk, composed of stars traveling
on nearly Keplerian orbits around a black hole or other dark compact object.
This hypothesis reproduces most of the features seen in HST photometry of the
center of M31; in particular the bright off-center source P1 is the apoapsis of
the disk. An eccentric disk can also explain the rotation curve and asymmetric
dispersion profile revealed by ground-based observations. The central object
must be smaller than 1 pc so that the potential felt by the disk is nearly
Keplerian. The disk eccentricity may be excited by a secular instability driven
by dynamical friction from the bulge.

A statistical analysis of texture on the {\it COBE}-DMR first year sky maps
based on the genus and spot number is presented. A generalized $\chi^2$
statistic is defined in terms of ``observable'' quantities: the genus and spot
density that would be measured by different cosmic observers. This strategy
together with the use of Monte Carlo simulations of the temperature
fluctuations, including all the relevant experimental parameters, represent the
main difference with previous analyses. Based on the genus analysis we find a
strong anticorrelation between the quadrupole amplitude $Q_{rms-PS}$ and the
spectral index $n$ of the density fluctuation power spectrum at recombination
of the form $Q_{rms-PS}= 22.2 \pm 1.7 - (4.7 \pm 1.3) \times n\ \mu$K for fixed
$n$, consistent with previous works. The result obtained based on the spot
density is consistent with this $Q_{rms-PS} (n)$ relation. In addition to the
previous results we have determined, using Monte Carlo simulations, the minimum
uncertainty due to cosmic variance for the determination of the spectral index
with the genus analysis. This uncertainty is $\delta n\approx 0.2$.

The primordial abundances of deuterium and of helium-3, produced during big
bang nucleosynthesis, depend sensitively on the baryon density. Thus, the
observed abundances of D and \he may provide useful ``baryometers'' provided
the evolution from primordial to present (or, presolar nebula) abundances is
understood. Inevitably, the derivation of primordial from observed abundances
requires the intervention of a model for galactic evolution and, so, the
inferred primordial abundances are, necessarily, model dependent. Here, an
analytic framework for the evolution of D and \he is presented which is
``generic'' in the sense that it should describe the results of any specific
galactic evolution model. The ``effective \he survival fraction'', $\Gamma _3$,
is the one free parameter which is model specific. Solar system and
interstellar data are used to infer upper and lower bounds to the primordial
deuterium mass fraction $(X_{2P})$ as a function of $\Gamma _3$ and, these
bounds are used to constrain the present baryon-to-photon ratio $(\eta)$ and
baryon density $(\Omega_B)$. For $\Gamma _3 \geq$ 1/4 it is found that (from D
and \he alone): $3.1 \leq \eta_{10} \leq 9.0$; $0.045 \leq \Omega_B h^2_{50}
\leq 0.133$ (where $H_0 = 50h_{50}$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$).

A sample of 45 symbiotic stars observed in the direction of the galactic
bulge are classified in spectral type using TiO $\lambda \lambda 6180, 7100
\AA$ and VO $\lambda \lambda 7865 \AA$ absorption feature indices and visual
comparison. The effective temperatures obtained are used together with K data
from the literature to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the giant
components if located at d=8.5 kpc. The ($T_{eff}$, $L/L_{\odot}$) pairs are
plotted on the HR diagram together with evolutionary tracks for metal rich
intermediate mass stars. The mass of the giant components seem to be scattered
in the interval ($\sim 1.5 - \sim 4 M_{\odot}$). The giant components of D-type
symbiotics appear as if they were more evolved objects than the corresponding
giants in S-type systems. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that they form an
evolutionary sequence. The results point also to the restriction of the
symbiotic phenomenon to the thermally pulsating phase of the AGB, strengthening
an accelerated mass loss scenario for the latest evolutionary stages of
intermediate mass stars.

We have used the Tremaine-Weinberg method to measure the angular speed of
rotation for the bar in the SB0 galaxy NGC 936. With this technique, the bar's
pattern speed, Omega_p, can be derived from the luminosity and
stellar-kinematic information in long-slit spectral observations taken parallel
to the major axis of the galaxy. The kinematic measurement required is the mean
line-of-sight velocity of all stellar light entering the slit. This quantity
can only be calculated reliably if any asymmetry in the shape of the broadening
function of the spectral lines is also measured, and so we present a method
which allows for such asymmetry. The technique also returns a true measure of
the RMS uncertainty in the estimate. Application of the analysis to a set of
long-slit spectra of NGC 936 returns four separate measures of Omega_p which
are mutually consistent. Combining these data produces a best estimate for the
bar pattern speed of Omega_p = 60 +/- 14 km/s/kpc (assuming a distance of 16.6
Mpc). This result refines the only previous attempt to make this measurement,
which yielded an estimate for Omega_p in NGC 936 of 104 +/- 37 km/s/kpc (Kent
1987). The new measurement places the co-rotation radius just beyond the end of
the bar, in agreement with theoretical calculations.

The dynamical structure and infrared emission of winds around late-type stars
are studied in a self-consistent model that couples the equations of motion and
radiative transfer. Both the dynamics and IR spectrum of the solution are fully
characterized by the flux averaged optical depth. Five types of dust grains are
considered: astronomical silicate, SiC, crystalline olivine, graphite and
amorphous carbon as well as mixtures. Analysis of infrared signatures provides
constraints on the grain chemical composition and indications for the
simultaneous existence of silicate and carbon grains. The region of parameter
space where radiation pressure can support a given mass-loss rate is identified
and a new method to derive mass loss rates from IR data is presented. IRAS LRS
classes are associated with optical depth for various grain materials and the
regions of color-color diagrams expected to be populated by late-type stars are
identified. We show that cirrus emission can severely affect point source
measurements to the extent that their listed IRAS long wavelength fluxes are
unreliable. After accounting for cirrus contamination, essentially all IRAS
point sources located in the relevant regions of the color-color diagrams can
be explained as late-type stars.

We report the discovery of a radio loud quasar with a redshift of 4.30. This
object, which is the first radio selected quasar with a redshift greater than
four, was discovered during an observational investigation into the evolution
of the luminosity function of radio loud quasars. Here we describe results
based on a sample of ~300, flat spectrum radio sources with S(5GHz) > 200mJy.
In this study, rather than carry out an indiscriminate redshift campaign on all
the radio sources, we have used the APM POSS catalogue to preselect a subset of
stellar-like optical counterparts with red optical colours. Such a subsample is
expected to contain a high fraction of high redshift quasars. 10 of the ~300
sources were selected for follow-up optical spectroscopy and three of these are
identified as quasars with redshifts greater than 3.0. One of the radio
sources, GB1508+5714, is a quasar with z=4.30 and m(R)~19.

We have carried out spectroscopic observations of the high redshift
($z\approx 3.4$) radio galaxy 0902+34 at intermediate resolution with the
William Herschel Telescope. The dynamical spectral ranges covered are 4600-5480
\AA and 5920-7680 \AA with resolutions of 5.4 \AA and 9.5 \AA, respectively. We
detect a continuum that is almost flat and resolve three emission lines:
Ly$\alpha$, C IV $\lambda$1549 and He II $\lambda$1640, the last one previously
undetected. The line ratios are similar to the typical values found for
narrow-line high redshift radio galaxies. Line ratios observed in different
regions of the galaxy seem to indicate the presence of strong ionization and/or
dust density gradients. We have not detected any Ly$\alpha$ absorption at
z=3.3968 (red wing of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line) as might be expected from
the absorption found at 21 cm by other authors using the VLA and Arecibo
antennas. We discuss possible models for the H I absorbing cloud.

This paper has been removed by arXiv admin because it was an erroneous
duplicate of astro-ph/9411031.

We have previously introduced the parameter `alpha' as an indicator of
stability to m=2 nonaxisymmetric modes in rotating, self-gravitating,
axisymmetric, gaseous and stellar systems. This parameter can be written as a
function of the total rotational kinetic energy, the total gravitational
potential energy, and as a function of the topology/connectedness and the
geometric shape of a system. Here we extend the stability criterion to
nonaxisymmetric equilibrium systems, such as ellipsoids and elliptical disks
and cylinders. We test the validity of this extension by considering
predictions for previously published, gaseous and stellar, nonaxisymmetric
models. The above formulation and critical values account accurately for the
stability properties of m=2 modes in gaseous Riemann S-type ellipsoids
(including the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids) and elliptical Riemann disks as
well as in stellar elliptical Freeman disks and cylinders: all these systems
are dynamically stable except for the stellar elliptical Freeman disks that
exhibit a relatively small region of m=2 dynamical instability.

Four operating neutrino observatories confirm the long standing discrepancy
between detected and predicted solar neutrino flux. Among these four
experiments the Homestake experiment is taking data for almost 25 years. The
reliability of the radiochemical method for detecting solar neutrinos has been
tested recently by the GALLEX experiment. All efforts to solve the solar
neutrino problem by improving solar, nuclear, and neutrino physics have failed
so far. This may also mean that the average solar neutrino flux extracted from
the four experiments may not be the proper quantity to explain the production
of neutrinos in the deep interior of the Sun. Occasionally it has been
emphasized that the solar neutrino flux may vary over time. In this paper we do
address relations among specific neutrino fluxes produced in the proton-proton
chain that are imposed by the coupled systems of non-linear partial
differential equations of solar structure and kinetic equations by focusing our
attention on a statistical interpretation of selected kinetic equation of
PPII/PPIII branch reactions of the proton-proton chain. A fresh look at the
statistical implications for the outcome of kinetic equations for nuclear
reactions may shed light on recent claims that the $^7$Be-neutrino flux of the
Sun is suppressed in comparison to the pp- and $^8$B neutrino fluxes and may
hint at that the solar neutrino flux is indeed varying over time as shown by
the Homestake experiment.

We summarise the results of a deep search for Lyman alpha emission from
star-forming regions associated with damped Lyman alpha absorption systems and
conclude that the Lyman alpha luminosity of high redshift galaxies is generally
less than 10^(42) erg/s . We also present a newly discovered case, in the field
of the QSO Q2059-360, where the emission is unusually strong, possibly because
the damped system is close in redshift to the QSO.

The damped Lyman alpha systems seen in the spectra of high redshift QSOs
offer the means to determine element abundances in galaxies observed while
still at an early stage of evolution. Such measurements, which have only
recently come within reach, complement and extend the data provided by studies
of different stellar populations in our Galaxy and of extragalactic H~II
regions which have up to now formed the basis of galactic chemical evolution
models. In this paper we demonstrate the potential of this new approach with
high-resolution echelle observations of several elements in the z(abs) =
2.27936 absorption system in the bright z(em) = 2.940 QSO 2348-147. The
absorbing galaxy appears to be chemically unevolved, with heavy element
abundances only 1/100 of solar; if it is the progenitor of a spiral galaxy like
our own, it is unlikely to have collapsed to form a thin disk by z = 2.3
(corresponding to a look-back time of approximately 13 Gyr for H_0 = 50
km/s/Mpc and q_0 = 0.01). Our data allow us to measure the nitrogen-to-oxygen
ratio at a metallicity lower than those of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies
known. We find that, relative to the solar scale, N is more underabundant than
O by at least a factor of 15. This result is broadly in line with current ideas
on the relative importance of primary and secondary production of N; future
measurements in several damped Lyman alpha systems will permit more stringent
tests of models for the evolution of the N/O ratio with time. Oxygen and other
alpha-elements are overabundant relative to Fe by no more than the factor of
about 3 typical of metal-poor stars in the disk and halo of the Milky Way.

We investigate the consistency of visual morphological classifications of
galaxies by comparing classifications for 831 galaxies from six independent
observers. The galaxies were classified on laser print copy images or on
computer screen produced from scans with the Automated Plate Measuring (APM)
machine. Classifications are compared using the Revised Hubble numerical type
index T. We find that individual observers agree with one another with rms
combined dispersions of between 1.3 and 2.3 type units, typically about 1.8
units. The dispersions tend to decrease slightly with increasing angular
diameter and, in some cases, with increasing axial ratio $(b/a)$. The agreement
between independent observers is reasonably good but the scatter is
non-negligible. In spite of the scatter the Revised Hubble T system can be used
to train an automated galaxy classifier, e.g. an Artificial Neural Network, to
handle the large number of galaxy images that are being compiled in the APM and
other surveys.

We review the quantitative science that can be and has been done with
redshift and peculiar velocity surveys of galaxies in the nearby universe.
After a brief background setting the cosmological context for this work, the
first part of this review focuses on redshift surveys. The practical issues of
how redshift surveys are carried out, and how one turns a distribution of
galaxies into a smoothed density field, are discussed. Then follows a
description of major redshift surveys that have been done, and the local
cosmography out to 8,000 km/s that they have mapped. We then discuss in some
detail the various quantitative cosmological tests that can be carried out with
redshift data. The second half of this review concentrates on peculiar velocity
studies, beginning with a thorough review of existing techniques. After
discussing the various biases which plague peculiar velocity work, we survey
quantitative analyses done with peculiar velocity surveys alone, and finally
with the combination of data from both redshift and peculiar velocity surveys.
The data presented rule out the standard Cold Dark Matter model, although
several variants of Cold Dark Matter with more power on large scales fare
better. All the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial
density field had a Gaussian distribution, although one cannot rule out broad
classes of non-Gaussian models. Comparison of the peculiar velocity and density
fields constrains the Cosmological Density Parameter. The results here are
consistent with a flat universe with mild biasing of the galaxies relative to
dark matter, although open universe models are by no means ruled out.

12 W~UMa-type systems were observed at 3.6 cm with a goal to compare their
radio luminosities with those of non-contact, rapidly rotating, late-type
stars. Only 3 systems, all of spectral type K, have been detected. The
detections and (low) upper limits for remaining systems confirm the strong
under-luminosity of W~UMa-type systems. VW~Cep, which was been detected several
times before, has been analyzed in terms of the temporal cumulative flux
distribution. Apparently, VW~Cep spends most of the time in radio quiescence
with flare-like events taking less than 20\% of time.

The classic question regarding Lyman-alpha forest clouds is whether they are
confined by the pressure of a hot, diffuse surrounding medium, or by the
gravity of dark matter mini-halos. This paper reviews these basic models for
forest clouds, considering spherical and slab geometries. At high redshift, the
clouds are still likely to be in the process of formation, and it seems
essential to consider them as dynamic structures in a cosmological context. At
low redshift, observations of large cloud sizes (indicated by their covering of
both lines of sight toward quasar pairs) have recently reshaped our view of the
forest. Galaxy-like disks/slabs, which would be gravity confined near the
center, but pressure confined in their outer regions (extending out to hundreds
of kpcs), may be responsible for the low z forest. The ultimate view of the
identity of the forest clouds and their relationship to galaxies is likely to
involve a synthesis of many of the models discussed here.

We have obtained images of the eclipsing pulsar binary PSR~B1957+20 using the
Planetary Camera of the Hubble Space Telescope. The high spatial resolution of
this instrument has allowed us to separate the pulsar system from a nearby
background star which has confounded ground-based observations of this system
near optical minimum. Our images limit the temperature of the backside of the
companion to $T \simlt 2800$~K, about a factor of two less than the average
temperature of the side of the companion facing the pulsar, and provide a
marginal detection of the companion at optical minimum. The magnitude of this
detection is consistent with previous work which suggests that the companion
nearly fills its Roche lobe and is supported through tidal dissipation.

Proton acceleration in nearby blazars can be diagnosed measuring their
intense TeV $\gamma$-ray emission. Flux predictions for 1101+384 (Mrk421) and
1219+285 (ON231), both strong EGRET sources (0.1-10 GeV), are obtained from
model spectra of unsaturated synchrotron pair cascades fitted to publicly
available multifrequency data. An experimental effort to confirm the predicted
emission in the range 1-10 TeV would be of great importance for the problems of
the origin of cosmic rays, the era of galaxy formation and the cosmological
distance scale.

77 W~UMa-type systems to $I=18$ mag in one of the 21 fields of OGLE have been
assessed in terms of utility for extraction of astrophysical information from
time-independent data such as colors, periods, maximum magnitudes, and
variability amplitudes in the final global OGLE catalog which will contain
$>1000$ contact binaries. A subset of systems with absolute magnitudes $M_I <
3$ permits mapping of stellar distribution towards the Galactic Bulge to about
6~kpc from us, with indications that the reddening $E_{V-I} > 0.6$.

We consider the growth of density perturbations in the presence of
self--interacting dark matter, SIDM, proposed by Carlson, Machacek and Hall
(1992). We determine the range of values for the coupling constant $\lambda$
and the particle mass $m^\prime$, for which the power spectrum lies in the
``allowed" range based on constraints from the IRAS galaxy survey and damped
Lyman--$\alpha $ systems. Our results show that no combination of parameters
can meet both limits. We consider constraints on the $\2-2$ scatterings which
keep the SIDM particles in pressure equilibrium, and we show that if such
interactions maintain pressure equilibrium down to the present, they will be
strong enough to disrupt galaxy mergers and may lead to stripping of galaxy
halos as galaxies move through the dark matter background of these particles.
Hence, we also investigate the evolution of large-scale structure in the SIDM
model when the particles drop out of pressure equilibrium at some higher
redshift. The resulting free-streaming leads to an additional suppression of
small-scale perturbations, but it does not significantly affect our results.

The morphological distribution of primordial density peaks is assessed.
Previous determinations, those of Peacock & Heavens (1985) and those of Bardeen
et al (1986) have contradictory concluded that there exist a tendency towards
prolate or towards oblate shapes, respectively. By using two methods, the
Hessian and the inertia tensor momenta we have performed numerical
determinations of the triaxiality of density perturbations in Gaussian random
fields with power law spectra. We show that there is no present any tendency of
shapes, and that the triaxiality distribution is independent of the spectral
index. Moreover, it is shown that the results of Peacock and Heavens are
compatible with our determinations. These results are in complete agreement
with current triaxial distributions inferred for galaxies and clusters both,
from observations and from numerical simulations.

For Gaussian initial conditions the perturbation theory predicts a very
specific hierarchy for the projected matter $p$-point correlation functions. In
the small angle approximation and assuming a power-law spectrum I derive the
exact expressions of the coefficients $s_p$ relating the averaged $p$-order
angular correlation function, $\omb_p$ to the second one, $\omb_p=s_p\
\omb_2^{p-1}$. These results are valid for any selection function, but for a
top-hat angular filter only. These coefficients are found to be significantly
higher than their 3D counterparts, $S_p=\xib_p/\xib_2^{p-1}$.
  For the coefficient $s_3$ I discussed the accuracy of the small angle
approximation by computing, for particular examples, its angular dependence
with Monte-Carlo numerical integrations. It is found that the accuracy of the
small angle approximation for $\theta\approx 1^o$ slightly depends on the
selection function. Using the selection function expected for galaxy catalogues
the approximation is found to be reasonably good.
  The measurements of the $s_p$ parameters made in the APM angular survey are
found to give systematic lower values than the theoretical predictions. How
significant this discrepancy is and what the implications would be for galaxy
formation models is discussed in the last section.

Whatever the ultimate energy source of gamma-ray bursts turns out to be, the
resulting sequence of physical events is likely to lead to a fairly generic,
almost unavoidable scenario: a relativistic fireball that dissipates its energy
after it has become optically thin. This is expected both for cosmological and
halo distances. Here we explore the observational motivation of this scenario,
and the consequences of the resulting models for the photon production in
different wavebands, the energetics and the time structure of classical
gamma-ray bursters.

We present the rotation curves (RCs) of 967 spiral galaxies, obtained by
folding and deprojecting the raw optical data by Mathewson et al. (1992). Out
of these, we have identified 80 excellent RCs and 820 fair RCs. The 80
excellent RCs are smooth, symmetric, have negligible rms internal error, extend
to at least the optical radius, and have high and homogeneus radial data
coverage; they rival with the best optical one-slit RCs available in the
literature and are ideally suited for detailed mass structure modelling. The
820 fair RCs do not meet at least one of the above criteria and hence are not
suitable for direct mass modelling; however, they constitute a large database
for methods aiming to recover statistical properties of DM. For these 900 RCs
we also present, in figures and tables, the rotation curves smoothed on scales
corresponding to 5%-20% of the optical size. By size, homogeneity, intrinsic
quality, and spanned range of luminosities and asymptotic velocities, this
sample constitutes by far the best sample of RCs available to date. As such, it
will offer a unique opportunity for investigating in considerable depth the
properties of DM in galaxies. The the deprojected folded curves, the smoothed
curves, and various related quantities are available via anonymous ftp at
galileo.sissa.it in the directory /users/ftp/pub/psrot.

We analyse the X-ray surface brightness profiles of 19 moderately distant and
luminous clusters of galaxies observed with the \EINOBS. Our aim is to
determine cluster gas masses out to radii between 1 and $3\Mpc$, and to confirm
the apparent conflict, if $\Omega_0=1$, between the current calculations of the
mean baryon fraction of the Universe expected from standard primordial
nucleosynthesis, and the fraction of the mass in clusters which is in gas. Our
analysis shows that baryon overdensities in clusters are much more widespread
than only the Coma cluster with which S.~White \& Frenk originally highlighted
this problem. The uncertainties involved in our analysis and some cosmological
implications from our results are briefly discussed. For a refined sample of 13
clusters we find that the baryon fraction for the gas within $1\Mpc$ lies
between 10 and 22 per cent.

We construct analytical phase-space solutions for perturbations of flat disks
by performing a power series expansion for the radius and the velocity
coordinates. We show that this approach translates into an elegant mathematical
formulation which is easy to use for a wide variety of distribution functions,
for as far as resonances do not play a role, such as is the case for potentials
which are close to quadratic. As a testcase, the method is applied on the
Kalnajs disks. The results obtained are in full agreement with the analytical
solutions of the mode analysis. The strongest advantages of this method are its
independence of the mathematical complexity of the unperturbed distribution,
the degree of detail with which the solutions can be calculated and its
computational straightforwardness. On the contrary, power series solutions are
not suitable for describing regions where resonant orbits occur, which we
therefore exclude in this paper. We used the technique to analyse perturbations
in the central regions of a galaxy, tracking the dynamical consequences of a
Galactic bar on the kinematics of the solar neighbourhood (Hipparcos). We
showed how the orientation and strength of the bar is related to the properties
of the velocity ellipsoid in our model.

We present a redshift survey of 124 galaxies, from an imaging $K$-band survey
complete to $K\simeq 17.3$. The optical-to-infrared colours are consistent with
the range expected from synthetic galaxy spectra, although there are some cases
of very red nuclei. Our data show no evidence for evolution of the $K$-band
luminosity function at $z<0.5$, and the results are well described by a
Schechter function with $M_K^*=-22.75\pm0.13+5\log_{10}h$ and
$\phi^*=0.026\pm0.003 h^3 {\rm Mpc^{-3}}$. This is a somewhat higher
normalization than has been found by previous workers, and it removes much of
the excess in faint $K$ and $B$ counts with respect to a no-evolution model.
However, we do find evidence for evolution at $z>0.5$: $M_K^*$ is approximately
0.75 mag. brighter at $z=1$. This luminosity evolution is balanced by a reduced
normalization at high redshift. The overall evolution is thus opposite to that
expected in simple merger-dominated models.

During the course of a gravitational lensing survey of distant, X-ray
selected, EMSS clusters of galaxies, we have studied 6 X-ray luminous (Lx >
5x10^44 h_{50}^{-2} erg s^{-1}) clusters at redshifts exceeding z=0.5. All of
these clusters are apparently massive. In addition to their high X-ray
luminosity, two of the clusters at z~0.6 exhibit gravitationally lensed arcs.
Furthermore, the highest redshift cluster in our sample, MS1054-0321 at
z=0.826, is both extremely X-ray luminous (L[0.3-3.5 keV]=9.3x10^{44}
h_{50}^{-2} erg s^{-1}), and exceedingly rich with an optical richness
comparable to an Abell Richness Class 4 cluster.
  In this {\it Letter}, we discuss the cosmological implications of the very
existence of these clusters for hierarchical stucture formation theories such
as standard \Omega=1 CDM, hybrid \Omega=1 C+HDM, and flat, low-density
\Lambda+CDM models.

The tightness of the observed colour-magnitude and Mg$_{2}$- velocity
dispersion relations for elliptical galaxies has often been cited as an
argument against a picture in which ellipticals form by the merging of spiral
disks. A common view is that merging would mix together stars of disparate ages
and produce a large scatter in these relations. Here I use semi-analytic models
of galaxy formation to derive the distribution of the mean ages, colours and
metallicities of the stars in elliptical galaxies formed by mergers in a flat
CDM universe. It is seen that most of the stars in ellipticals form at
relatively high redshift (z > 1.9) and that the predicted scatter in the
colour-magnitude and Mg_2 - sigma relations falls within observational bounds.
I conclude that the apparent homogeneity in the properties of the stellar
populations of ellipticals is not inconsistent with a merger scenario for the
origin of these systems.

This paper presents an angular correlation analysis of the Green Bank 4.85
GHz radio catalog (Gregory \& Condon 1991) of 54,579 sources (S \gsim 25 mJy).
The Green Bank catalog is found to be complete to S $\geq$ 35 mJy over
20$^{\circ} \leq \delta < 74^{\circ}$, 0$^h \leq \alpha < 24^h$, and Galactic
latitude $|b| \geq 10^{\circ}$. The 2-point angular correlation function shows
evidence for the clustering of radio sources, with a power-law distribution
consistent with a slope $\gamma = -0.8$. This may well provide the $first$
detection of an angular correlation in a large area, complete deep radio
survey.

This is an introduction to accretion disk theory, with emphasis on aspects
relevant for X-ray Binaries and Cataclysmic Variables. The text corrects some
mistakes in an earlier version, which appeared in 'Lives of Neutron Stars', A.
Alpar, \"U. Kizilo\u glu and J. van Paradijs (eds.), Kluwer, Dordrecht (NATO
ASI series, 1994).

We report the first detection of a hard power-law tail in the X-ray spectrum
of the black hole candidate (BHC) binary X1755-338, which was observed in 1989
March-September during the TTM Galactic Centre survey. In addition, an
ultrasoft thermal component with a temperature of ~1.1-1.4 keV was also
detected. We demonstrate that the soft and hard X-ray components of X1755-338
vary independently, as in the spectra of the well known BHCs LMC X-1, LMC X-3
and GX339-4 in their high (intensity) state. If the hard tail observed from
X1755-338 is generated near the black hole by energetic electrons up-scattering
low energy photons, the un-correlated variations imply that the soft X-rays
from accretion disc may not be the main photon seeds needed for inverse
Comptonization. The TTM observations strongly suggest that X1755-338 does
indeed belong to the family of BHCs.

We study the distribution of low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ clouds in a CDM model
using numerical simulations including photoionization and cooling of the
baryonic component. The ionizing background is found to be efficient enough to
keep most of the gas warm ($T$~=~1--5~10$^4$~K) and to prevent most of it from
collapsing. In this scenario, the numerous low redshift ($z$~$<$~0.5) neutral
hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ lines recently revealed by HST observations of QSOs
originate in the warm gas that traces the potential wells of filamentary
structures defined by the dark matter. The predicted line number density is
consistent with observations. About 25\% of the Ly$\alpha$ lines are found to
arise in extended envelopes of luminous galaxies or groups of galaxies
($M$~$>$~3~10$^{11}$~M$_{\odot}$) of radius of the order of 1.5~Mpc. The exact
number, however, is model dependent. The remainder arises in gas independent of
any galaxy and at a distance of 2 to 7~Mpc from the first neighbour galaxy.

We present the redshift data for a survey of galaxies selected from the data
base of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). This survey extends the
1.936 Jy sample of Strauss et al. (1992) from a flux limit of 1.936 Jy at 60
microns to 1.2 Jy. The survey extension consists of 3920 sources in the flux
interval 1.2 - 1.936 Jy, of which 2663 are galaxies with measured redshifts.
Fourteen objects (0.52%) do not have redshifts. The survey covers 87.6% of the
sky. The data for the complete 1.2 Jy survey (the data presented here in
addition to that of Strauss \etal 1992) may be obtained in a machine-readable
form from the National Space Science Data Center and from the anonymous ftp
site given above.

The status of the Agape experiment to detect Machos in the direction of the
andromeda galaxy is presented.

The temperature distribution function (TDF) of X-ray clusters is derived for
different normalizations of the HDM power spectrum in an Omega_0=1 universe
using the statistics of peaks of a random Gaussian field. Concerning cluster
formation only, the neutrino picture appears to be marginally consistent with
observations for H_0=70 km/s/Mpc provided the normalization is
alpha=sigma_0/delta_s=0.42 with sigma_0 the rms variance of the fluctuations
linearly evolved to the present epoch and delta_s the collapse threshold
required in structure formation models. However, using the constraint that the
formation epoch of QSO's puts on the HDM model, it appears that this
normalization is too small to be consistent with quasars formation. Allowing
higher values for the Hubble constant alleviates this problem but leads to an
unacceptable short age of the universe. Moreover, the constraint put by the
recent measurement of the level of fluctuations in the cosmic background
radiation by COBE tends to reject models with high values of H_0. We conclude
that the neutrino model fails in any case to account for the whole set of
available observations in a consistent way.

Along with data on radial velocities, more and more data on proper motions of
individual stars in globular clusters are becoming available. Their usage was
until now rather limited. It was mostly restricted to determining cluster
membership of individual stars and to determining the spatial velocity of the
cluster. We study the two dimensional distribution of the proper motions, in
order to clarify the relation between the projection of the velocities and the
dynamical structure. Obviously some assumptions on the dynamics of the system
have to be made. In this study we chose a Plummer model. This complements an
earlier study about line profiles. The three velocity dispersions in the main
directions are determined and compared with the three spherical velocity
dispersions. Two parameters analogous to Binney's anisotropy parameter $\beta$
are defined. Moreover, since the proper motion components are distance
dependent and the line of sight velocity dispersion is distance independent, we
show explicitly how to determine distances.

Low-mass binary millisecond pulsars (LMBPs) are born with very small orbital
eccentricities, typically of order $e_i\sim10^{-6}$--$10^{-3}$. In globular
clusters, however, higher eccentricities $e_f\gg e_i$ can be induced by
dynamical interactions with passing stars. Here we show that the cross section
for this process is much larger than previously estimated. This is because,
even for initially circular binaries, the induced eccentricity $e_f$ for an
encounter with pericenter separation $r_{\rm p}$ beyond a few times the binary
semi-major axis $a$ declines only as a power-law, $e_f\propto(r_{\rm p}/a)^
{-5/2}$, and {\it not\/} as an exponential. We find that {\it all\/} currently
known \lmbps in clusters were probably affected by interactions, with their
current eccentricities typically an order of magnitude or more greater than at
birth.

We report the results of new SPH calculations of parabolic collisions between
main-sequence (MS) stars. The stars are assumed to be close to the MS turn-off
point in a globular cluster and are therefore modeled as $n=3$, $\Gamma=5/3$
polytropes. We find that the high degree of central mass concentration in these
stars has a profound effect on the hydrodynamics. In particular, very little
hydrodynamic mixing occurs between the dense, helium-rich inner cores and the
outer envelopes. As a result, and in contrast to what has been assumed in
previous studies, blue stragglers formed by direct stellar collisions are not
necessarily expected to have anomalously high helium abundances in their
envelopes or to have their cores replenished with fresh hydrogen fuel.

We train Artificial Neural Networks to classify galaxies based solely on the
morphology of the galaxy images as they appear on blue survey plates. The
images are reduced and morphological features such as bulge size and the number
of arms are extracted, all in a fully automated manner. The galaxy sample was
first classified by 6 independent experts. We use several definitions for the
mean type of each galaxy, based on those classifications. We then train and
test the network on these features. We find that the rms error of the network
classifications, as compared with the mean types of the expert classifications,
is 1.8 Revised Hubble Types. This is comparable to the overall rms dispersion
between the experts. This result is robust and almost completely independent of
the network architecture used.

Under the assumption of a void-filled Universe we investigate if the
characteristic scale of voids can be determined from existing surveys. We use
the Voronoi tessellation to create mock surveys and study the properties of the
first zero-crossing of the two-point correlation function for various survey
geometries. Our main conclusion is that the available data sets should be able
to discriminate between 5000 \kms and 12000 \kms voids, if one of these scales
actually characterizes the distribution of galaxies.

Wray 977, the B supergiant companion of the X-ray pulsar GX301-2, should be
classified as B1~Ia+, based on a comparison of its optical spectrum to that of
zeta1 Sco, a well-known B hypergiant and ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST STARS IN THE
GALAXY. The classification of Wray 977 as a hypergiant results in a new
distance determination of the binary system, i.e. 5.3 kpc (previously 1.8 +/-
0.4 kpc). The ``average'' X-ray luminosity of the pulsar is then ~10^37 erg/s,
in good agreement with the predicted X-ray luminosity resulting from accretion
of a dense, low-velocity (v_infty = 400 km/s) stellar wind. A mass-loss rate of
<= 10^-5 M_sun/yr is estimated from the Halpha profile. A new upper limit for
the inclination of the system is derived which provides a lower limit to the
(present) mass of Wray 977 (48 M_sun). Regarding current binary evolution
scenarios, the empirical lower mass limit for BLACK-HOLE formation in a binary
increases to M_zams >= 50 M_sun.

Observational constraints on standard CDM spectra and perturbation spectra
with broken scale invariance are discussed.

Attempts to measure the optical depth due to a diffuse intergalactic medium
(IGM) in the spectra of high redshift quasars (GP test) within the ESO key
program on the intergalactic medium are reviewed. It is shown that there is no
evidence for any Gunn-Peterson effect up to the highest redshifts observable in
quasar spectra. The Ly$\alpha$ line statistics consistent with this limit is
not able to explain the strong absorption observed at the HeII forest in one
QSO, leaving room for a true HeII GP effect. The HI/HeII GP ratio implies a
steep ionizing UV background at $z\sim 5$ and ionizing sources of stellar
origin.

The present understanding of type Ib/c supernovae and their connection to
interacting binaries is reviewed. The problems of the classification and the
lack of well-observed events exclude direct inference of progenitor
characteristics. The absence of hydrogen lines in the observed spectrum,
nevertheless, requires restricted evolutionary schemes to produce suitable
progenitor stars for core collapse explosions with no hydrogen envelope. New
relative statistics among the supernova types are presented which indicate that
SN~Ib/c are on average brighter than SN~II, and with the dense sampling of
supernova searches in nearby galaxies, a small intrinsic incidence of SN~Ib/c
is determined. The small rates might be in conflict with the observed ratio of
massive stars in binaries in the Galaxy.

Infrared surveys provide essential insights on galaxy evolution. If near-IR
studies suggest mild evolution of stellar populations with cosmic time,
indications of a substantial evolution have been seen in the far-IR, although
the available information is largely insufficient to delineate precise
evolutionary properties. A consistent picture encompassing all the currently
available data may be obtained assuming that dust extinction hides the early
evolutionary phases of spheroidal galaxies in the optical band, while the
corresponding dust re-radiation in the far-IR may have been, during the early
evolutionary phases, orders of magnitude larger than today. Hyperluminous IRAS
galaxies might be extreme examples of this situation. Additional indications
that at least some spheroidal galaxies may have been very dusty during their
early evolution are provided by recent data on high redshift radio galaxies and
quasars. Galaxies are the likely dominant contributors to the IR background.
However, in the framework of unified models for Active Galactic Nuclei, a large
number of nuclei hidden by a dusty torus may be expected. Implications for the
IR background are discussed.

By analysing and modelling the change in the abundance ratio of
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O on the surface of the lower mass star
of a binary during the common-envelope (CE) phase of evolution, we propose a
simple observational test of the CE scenario. The test is based on the infrared
measurement of either the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C or $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O ratio of red
dwarfs in post-common envelope binaries (PCEB's). In certain cases
(main-sequence red dwarf secondaries in PCEB's without planetary nebulae), as
well as determining whether or not accretion has occurred during the CE phase,
we can determine the amount of mass accreted during the CE phase and hence the
initial mass of the red dwarf component prior to the CE phase. In the other
cases considered (low-mass red dwarfs in PCEB's and red dwarf's in PCEB's with
planetary nebulae) we can only say whether or not accretion has occurred during
the CE phase.

A modification to the absolute magnitude calibration for W~UMa-type systems,
taking into account differences in metal abundances, is derived on the basis of
contact binary systems recently discovered in metal-poor clusters. A
preliminary estimate of the magnitude of the metallicity-dependent term for the
$(B-V)$-based calibration is $\Delta M_V = -(0.3 \pm 0.1) \times [Fe/H]$. The
calibration based on the $(V-I_C)$ color is expected to be less sensitive with
the correction term $\approx -(0.12\pm 0.05) \times [Fe/H]$.

N-body simulations were conducted of pairs of galaxies with a 3:1 mass ratio
on parabolic orbits, in order to quantify the effect of dynamical friction. The
effects of varying the ratio of the dark matter halo size to the distance of
closest approach were explored. Once the dark matter halos are fully
overlapping, the more massive simulated galaxies achieve a larger maximum
separation after the first encounter despite the increased dynamical friction
caused by the more extended halos. Projected separation and radial velocity
histograms were generated by "observing" the simulation results at various
times and from various orientations. These histograms were compared with
observations of galaxy pairs (Charlton & Salpeter 1991; Chengalur, Salpeter, &
Terzian 1993) with the result that large halo radii (~200 - 600 kpc) and wide
distances of closest approach are generally favored. It is difficult to
reconcile the small radial velocity differences that have been observed (median
of ~ 30 km/s, Chengalur et al. 1993) with the simulations when we sample all
parts of the orbits equally. Including an additional population of wide pairs
that have just recently reached "turnabout" from the Hubble flow would lower
the median velocity differences. Models suggest that additional data for pairs
at intermediate separations should have a somewhat larger median velocity
difference than the wide pairs. Very narrow pairs include galaxies which are
interacting, and whose gaseous components respond to forces other than gravity.
If consistently small $\Delta v$ are measured from neutral hydrogen velocities
in a larger sample of narrow pairs, pressure forces and dissipation effects on
the gaseous components could be responsible.

Weak lensing is the distortion (polarization) of images of distant objects,
such as high redshift galaxies, by gravitational fields in the limit where the
distortion is small. Gravitational potential fluctuations due to large scale
structure cause correlated distortions of the images of high redshift galaxies.
These distortions are observable with current large telescopes and
instrumentation. In a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric I calculate the
weak lensing pattern due to large scale structure for arbitrary $\Omega_0$ and
zero cosmological constant $\Lambda$. For a given cosmological model, specified
by $\Omega_0$ and a power spectrum of density fluctuations, I calculate the
statistical properties of the polarization field for an arbitrary redshift
source distribution in a simple closed form. It is shown that for low redshift
$z$ of the sources, the polarization amplitude is proportional to $\Omega_0$,
while at higher redshift the polarization measures the value of $\Omega(z)$,
where $z$ is the characteristic source redshift. Moreover, the statistics of
the polarization field are a direct measure of the power spectrum of density
fluctuations.

ROSAT HRI observations have been used to determine an upper limit of the Crab
pulsar surface temperature from the off-pulse count rate. For a neutron star
mass of 1.4 \Mo and a radius of 10 km as well as the standard distance and
interstellar column density, the redshifted temperature upper limit is\/
$T_s^\infty \le 1.55\times 10^6$ K $(3\sigma)$. This is the lowest temperature
upper limit obtained for the Crab pulsar so far. Slightly different values for
$T_s^\infty$ are computed for the various neutron star models available in the
literature, reflecting the difference in the equation of state.

We present results of ROSAT/PSPC and HRI observations of the AWM7 group of
galaxies, which is a poor galaxy cluster and forms part of the Perseus-Pisces
filament. The X-ray emission originates from intracluster gas at temperatures
of 1.7 to 4.5 keV. The cluster obviously is elliptical with a position angle
perpendicular to the position angle of the dominant elliptical galaxy NGC1129,
which is offset from the cluster X-ray centre by 30 kpc. The analysis of the
PSPC imaging and spectral data yield a gravitational mass of
2--5$\cdot10^{14}$\msun within a radius of 1.2 Mpc and a cooling flow with a
mass deposition rate of up to 60--66 \msun y$^{-1}$.

In this paper we review the hypothesis that a considerable part of the cosmic
ray flux observed above about $10^{19}\eV$ may be produced by decaying or
annihilating topological defects left over from phase transitions in the early
universe at grand unification energy scales ($\approx10^{16}\GeV$). Possible
signatures of cosmic ray producing defect models are discussed which could be
tested experimentally in the near future. We thereby focus on model independent
universal spectral properties of the predicted particle fluxes.

One- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino-driven
supernova explosions are discussed. The simulations cover the phase between the
stagnation of the prompt shock and about one second after core bounce.
Systematic variation of the neutrino fluxes from the neutrino sphere shows that
the explosion energy, explosion time scale, initial mass of the protoneutron
star, and explosive nucleosynthesis of iron-group elements depend sensitively
on the strength of the neutrino heating during the first few 100 ms after shock
formation. Convective overturn in the neutrino-heated region behind the shock
is a crucial help for the explosion only in a narrow window of neutrino
luminosities. Here powerful explosions can be obtained only in the
multi-dimensional case. For higher core-neutrino fluxes also spherically
symmetrical models yield energetic explosions, while for lower luminosities
even with convection no strong explosions occur.

Observations of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the Orion OB1
association show a cavity filled with hot ionized gas, surrounded by an
expanding shell of neutral hydrogen (the Orion-Eridanus Bubble). In this paper
we examine this cavity and the surrounding bubble with the aid of data from the
Leiden/Dwingeloo HI survey. We present neutral-hydrogen maps for the
Orion-Eridanus region which allow identification of the HI filaments and arcs
delineating the Bubble and derivation of its expansion velocity. The HI data
are compared to X-ray, CO and IRAS 100 micron data. Using models of wind blown
bubbles that take the density stratification of the Galactic HI layer into
account we show that the stellar winds and supernovae from stars in Orion OB1
can account for the size as well as the expansion velocity of the HI shell.
However, density inhomogeneities in the ambient interstellar medium cause
significant discrepancies between our model and the observed shell.

A double inflationary model with enhanced power at large scales --- Broken
Scale Invariant perturbations (BSI) --- leads to a promising scenario for the
formation of large-scale structure. We use high-resolution PM simulations with
a model for the thermodynamic evolution of baryons. Galactic halos are
identified as peaks in the distribution of mass points which had time to cool
providing a physical biasing mechanism. The clustering properties of galactic
halos are in agreement with both small-scale and large-scale characteristics of
the galaxy distribution, as variances of counts in cells, 'galaxy' correlation
functions, 'cluster' abundances and 'cluster-cluster' correlation functions,
and velocity dispersions at small scales.

I argue that there is a crisis in optical Astronomy due to a paucity of
telescopes and thus the need for a paradigm shift in telescope technology.
Large increases in collecting areas and observing time/astronomer are only
possible if we forgo the fully steerable multipurpose telescope with a glass
primary mirror that has dominated astronomical research. Only by adopting
entirely novel technologies that allow one to build large and inexpensive
telescopes can we achieve truly large improvements. This may come at the
expense of versatility and may entail changes in the observing strategies
astronomers are now accustomed to. I build my case around a new technology,
liquid mirrors, that although in its infancy has achieved credibility. I argue
that forthcoming technological improvements will make Liquid Mirror Telescopes
(LMTs) nearly as versatile as conventional telescopes. I address the issue of
the fields accessible to LMTs equipped with novel optical correctors. Optical
design work and exploratory laboratory work indicate that a single LMT should
be able to access, with excellent images, subregions anywhere inside fields as
large as 45 degrees.
  As a practical example of what an LMT can do with the present technology, I
examine the expected performance of a 5-m liquid mirror telescope, presently
under construction, dedicated to a cosmological survey. It is rather
impressive, due to the fact that the instrument works full-time on a four-year
survey: Spectrophotometry reaches B=24 with a signal to noise ratio of 10
within a 200\AA bandpass for all objects within 300 square degrees and
wide-band photometry reaches about B=27. I give three examples of cosmological
projects that can be done with the data.

We present results from a search for gravitational microlensing of stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud by low mass objects in the Galactic Halo. The search
uses the CCD light curves of about 82,000 stars with up to 46 measurements per
night over a period of 10 months. No light curve exhibits a form that is
consistent with a microlensing event of maximum amplification greater than 1.2.
This null result makes it unlikely that the Halo is dominated by objects in the
mass range $5 10^{-8}M_{\odot} < M <5 10^{-4}M_{\odot} $. keywords{Galaxy :

We use numerical simulations to test the feasibility of the suggestion by
Ibata et al. (1994) that the excess population of stars which they discovered
in the Sagittarius region may be the disrupted remains of a dwarf spheroidal
galaxy. We find that a Fornax-like model for the pre-disruption system can
indeed reproduce the data. However, the galaxy must be on a relatively short
period orbit with a pericentre of about $10$ kpc and an apocentre of about $52$
kpc, giving a current transverse velocity of $255$ km/s and a period of $\sim
760$ Myr. Furthermore, disruption must have occurred predominantly on the last
pericentric passage rather than on the present one. The data are consistent
with transverse motion either towards or away from the Galactic Plane. These
results depend primarily on the rotation curve of the Galaxy and are
insensitive to the mass distribution in its outer halo or to the mass of its
disk.

The recent observations of high-velocity maser emissions in NGC 4258 by
Myoshi et al provide strong evidence for a central object of mass 3.6 10**7
solar masses in the nucleus of this galaxy based on a kinematic argument.
However, they should allow an independent determination of the central object
mass via gravitational redshift. We briefly discuss the size of the effect, and
show that it should be detected in a more detailed analysis of the data.

We discuss the results of a campaign to monitor spectral variations in the
low-luminosity Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC~4593, at X-rays, ultraviolet, optical and
near IR frequencies. The observations and data analysis have been described in
a companion paper (Santos-Lle\'o et al. 1994; Paper~1). The active nucleus in
this galaxy is strongly and rapidly variable in all wavebands, implying that
the continuum source is unusually compact. Its energy distribution from
1.2~$\mu$m to 1200~\AA\/ obeys a power-law whose index is significantly steeper
than is usual in Seyfert's or QSO's; the ``big bump'' is either absent or
shifted to wavelengths shorter than 1200~\AA\/. The variations of the
soft-X~ray {\em excess\/} do not correlate with those of the UV or hard X-ray
continuum. The far UV and optical fluxes are well correlated, while the
correlation between the hard X-rays and 1447 \AA\ continuum is only marginally
significant. Moreover, the optical flux cannot lag behind the UV by more than 6
days. These results cannot be accommodated in the framework of the standard
geometrically thin accretion disk model. Rather, they suggest that the bulk of
the UV and optical flux originates from thermal reprocessing of X-rays
irradiating the disk. The soft X-ray excess is probably the only spectral
component which originates from viscous dissipation inside the disk and the
near infrared is probably emitted by hot dust heated by the UV radiation. Such
a model is consistent with NGC~4593 having a relatively small black-hole mass
of the order of $2\times10^{6}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ as inferred from the line
variability study. The high ionization/excitation emission lines are very broad
and strongly variable and their variations correlate with those of the
continuum. The low excitation lines are significantly narrower and remain
constant within the accuracy of our measurements. These results suggest a
stratified BLR, where the degree of ionization and the velocity dispersion of
the gas increase toward small radii. The \lya\ line responds to the variations
of the continuum with a delay $\leq 4$ days. To a first order approximation,
the BLR in NGC~4593 is well modelled with two different zones at distances of
$\sim$~15 and 3 lt-ds from the ionizing source respectively.

The gravitational evolution of scale free initial spectra $P(k)\propto k^n$
in an Einstein-de Sitter universe is widely believed to be self-similar for
$-3<n<4$. However, for $-3<n<-1$ the existence of self-similar scaling has not
been adequately demonstrated. Here we investigate the possible breaking of
self-similar scaling due to the nonlinear contributions of long wave modes. For
$n<-1$ the nonlinear terms in the Fourier space fluid equations contain terms
that diverge due to contributions from wavenumber $k\to 0$ (the long wave
limit). To assess the possible dynamical effects of this divergence the limit
of long wave contributions is investigated in detail using two different
analytical approaches.
  Perturbative contributions to the power spectrum are examined. It is shown
that for $n<-1$ there are divergent contributions at all orders. However, at
every order the leading order divergent terms cancel out exactly. This does not
rule out the existence of a weaker but nevertheless divergent net contribution.
The second approach consists of a non-perturbative approximation, developed to
study the nonlinear effects of long wave mode coupling. A solution for the
phase shift of the Fourier space density is obtained which is divergent for
$n<-1$. A kinematical interpretation of the divergence of the phase shift,
related to the translational motion induced by the large-scale bulk velocity,
is given. Our analysis indicates that the amplitude of the density is {\it not}
affected by the divergent terms. Thus both analytical approaches lead to the
conclusion that the self-similar scaling of physically relevant measures of the
growth of density perturbations is preserved.

We investigate the hydrodynamics of three-dimensional classical Bondi-Hoyle
accretion. A totally absorbing sphere of different sizes (1, 0.1 and 0.02
accretion radii) exerts gravity on and moves at different Mach numbers (0.6,
1.4, 3.0 and 10) relative to a homogeneous and slightly perturbed medium, which
is taken to be an ideal gas ($\gamma=4/3$). We examine the influence of Mach
number of the flow and size of the accretor upon the physical behaviour of the
flow and the accretion rates. The hydrodynamics is modeled by the ``Piecewise
Parabolic Method'' (PPM). The resolution in the vicinity of the accretor is
increased by multiply nesting several $32^3$-zone grids around the sphere, each
finer grid being a factor of two smaller in zone dimension than the next
coarser grid. This allows us to include a coarse model for the surface of the
accretor (vacuum sphere) on the finest grid while at the same time evolving the
gas on the coarser grids. For small Mach numbers (0.6 and~1.4) the flow
patterns tend towards a steady state, while in the case of supersonic flow
(Mach~3 and~10) and small enough accretors, (radius of~0.1 and~0.02 accretion
radii) an unstable Mach cone develops, destroying axisymmetry. Our 3D models do
not show the highly dynamic flip-flop flow so prominent in 2D calculations
performed by other authors. In the gamma=4/3 models, the shock front remains
closer to the accretor and the mass accretion rates are higher than in the
gamma=5/3 models, whereas the rms of the specific angular momentum accreted
does not change.

We investigate the dynamics and evolution of coalescing neutron stars. The
three-dimensional Newtonian equations of hydrodynamics are integrated by the
`Piecewise Parabolic Method' However, we do include the effects of the emission
of gravitational waves on the hydrodynamics. The properties of neutron star
matter are described by the equation of state of Lattimer & Swesty. In addition
to the fundamental hydrodynamic quantities, density, momentum, and energy, we
follow the time evolution of the electron density in the stellar gas. Energy
losses and changes of the electron abundance due to the emission of neutrinos
are taken into account by an elaborate ``neutrino leakage scheme'', which
employs a careful calculation of the lepton number and energy source terms of
all neutrino types. The grid is Cartesian and equidistant with a resolution of
64**3 or 128**3, which allows us to calculate the self-gravity via fast Fourier
transforms.

Spectrophotometric indices for $18$ Galactic globular clusters, obtained from
CCD observations and careful reductions, were used to determine reliable
calibrations on metallicity $[Fe/H]$. The indices were measured in the
bandpasses adopted by Burnstein et al. (\cite{BFGK84}). Adding other
observations of Burnstein et al. (\cite{BFGK84}) we obtained our results from
an homogeneous sample of indices for $26$ globular clusters. Relations with
indices defined by other Authors and with metallicity photometric indices or
parameters were also computed. In each case the relations are quite
satisfactory. Observational data were compared with synthetic indices derived
from Buzzoni's (\cite{B89}) models and detailed discussions were performed for
$Mg_2$, $Fe_{52}$, and $H_\beta$. The observational points seem to be
systematically shifted with respect to the fiducial lines traced by the models.
The scenario confirms that a certain degree of oxygen enhancement would be
necessary to obtain a better agreement between observed data and theoretical
predictions. This enhancement, however, removes some of the disagreement, but
not all of it. The dependence of the observed $Fe_{52}$ and $H_\beta$ indices
on the metal content for different HB morphologies was considered. Finally,
some results were also discussed from a statistical point of view. A principal
component analysis was applied to the index sample to study the number of
independent parameters necessary to reproduce the observations. The whole index
set is completely consistent with a one-parameter family.

We analyze the $2-10$~keV X-ray emission of complete samples of AGN and
galaxies selected at 12$\mu$m and recently compiled by Rush, Malkan \&
Spinoglio (1993). As a necessary complement we also study the IR emissivity of
the largest sample of hard X--ray selected AGN (Grossan 1992). Our purposes are
to probe the unified scheme of active nuclei and to evaluate the local X--ray
volume emissivity of low luminosity and `hidden' AGN. We confirm that X-ray
emission is basically restricted to AGN, Seyfert 1's being much more powerful
emitters than Seyfert 2's. We find no signal of X-ray emission for the
remaining galaxies selected at $12\mu$m, not even for those having a flat
far-infrared spectrum, which would be prime candidates to host hidden AGN. Our
result on the local volume emissivity of the Seyfert 1's is fully consistent
with those derived from studies of the hard X--ray luminosity function. However
the 95$\%$ upper limits to the local emissivity we derive for the Seyfert 2
class and for the most likely `hidden' AGN candidates, severely constrain (and
in some cases exclude) models of the X--ray background based on the unified
Seyfert scheme. We also find that less than $\sim20$\% of Seyfert 1-like AGN
and less than $\sim 50$\% of Seyfert 2-like AGN can be `hidden' in the
non-Seyfert galaxy samples assuming that the X-ray to 12$\mu$m flux ratios
measured in the 12$\mu$m selected samples can be considered typical for these
classes of objects. In this case, the number ratio of Seyfert 2 to Seyfert 1
galaxies ranges from 1 to 2.

Motivated by recent neutral hydrogen observations with the VLA, we have
undertaken an investigation into the interaction that produced the well known
merger remnant NGC 7252. Through fully self-consistent N-body simulations, we
are able to reproduce the kinematic character of the HI observations quite
well, including the velocity reversals observed along each tidal tail. In the
simulation these reversals arise from particles which have turned around in
their orbit and are moving to smaller radii. The bases of the tails fall back
quickly to small pericentric distances, while the more distant regions fall
back more slowly to ever increasing pericentric distances. The delayed return
of tidally ejected material may extend over many Gyr. The evolution of this
merger is followed numerically for 800 h^-1 Myr beyond the best fit time. We
find that nearly half of the present tail material, or of order 10^9 h^-2 of
neutral hydrogen and 2x10^9 h^-2 of starlight, will return to within 13 h^-1
kpc of the nucleus within this time span. While the collisionless stars of the
tails will continue orbiting between their inner and outer turning points, the
observations show the HI gas of the tails disappearing upon its return. We
discuss this result in light of the lack of central HI in the main body of this
merger remnant.

We present observations of OY Car, obtained with the Anglo-Australian
Telescope, during a normal outburst in August 1991. Two sinusoidal components
are resolved in the H$\beta$ trailed spectra and we determine the location of
the narrow component to be on the secondary star with a maximum contributed
flux of ~2.5 per cent to the total flux. Imaging of the line distribution
reveals that the other emission component is associated with the gas stream.
This follows a velocity close to the ballistic one from the red star to a
distance of ~0.5 R$_{L_{1}}$ from the white dwarf. This emission penetrates the
accretion disc (from 0.5--0.1 R$_{L_{1}}$), with a velocity now closer (but
lower) to the keplerian velocities along the path of the gas stream. We finally
discuss the implications of having observed simultaneously line emission from
the gas stream and the red star during outburst.

Visual, NIR, and H_alpha surface photometry of the oval disk galaxy M94 (NGC
4736) was performed to study the distribution of mass in old stars and the
distribution of the warm emission line gas. The radial profile of the inner
stellar disk is steeper than exponential and displays twisted and deformed
isophotes. Dust is not responsible for these deviations. The investigation of a
number of morphological models showed that M94 has a weak central stellar bar
of 0.7 kpc major axis length which comprises about 14 per cent of the total
light within 20 arcsec. By means of longslit spectroscopy the kinematics of gas
and stars in this region were investigated. The stellar kinematics reveal the
existence of a small spheroidal bulge with v/sigma of about 0.8. The stellar
velocity field in this region is approximately axisymmetric, showing that the
effects of the bar on the kinematics of the hot component are relatively small.
The warm gas in the bar region shows global and local deviations from the
stellar kinematics, but outside the central bar fits into the general HI
velocity field. Model calculations of closed orbits for gas in the potential of
the bar perturbation and axisymmetric disk and bulge predict large non-circular
motions for cold gas in equilibrium flow. These do not fit the central H_alpha
kinematics; rather it appears that the H_alpha gas must have large random
motions and is not in a steady state, and that hydrodynamical effects due to a
recent starburst play a role in the central region.

We compute the three-point temperature correlation function of the COBE
Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) two-year sky maps to search for
evidence of non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations. We detect three-point
correlations in our sky with a substantially higher signal-to-noise ratio than
from the first year data. However, the magnitude of the signal is consistent
with the level of cosmic variance expected from Gaussian fluctuations, even
when the low order multipole moments, up to l = 9, are filtered from the data.
These results do not strongly constrain most existing models of structure
formation, but the absence of intrinsic three-point correlations on large
angular scales is an important consistency test for such models.

We have detected circumstellar molecular gas around a small sample of T Tauri
stars through aperture synthesis imaging of CO(2-1) emission at ~2-3''
resolution. RY Tauri, DL Tauri, DO Tauri, and AS 209 show resolved and
elongated gaseous emission. For RY Tau, the deconvolved, half-maximum radius
along the direction of elongation, PA~48deg, is 110 AU. Corresponding radii and
orientations for the other sources are: DL Tau -- 250 AU at PA~84deg; DO Tau --
350 AU at PA~160deg; AS 209 -- 290 AU at PA~138deg. RY Tau, DL Tau, and AS 209
show velocity gradients parallel to the elongation, suggesting that the
circumstellar material is rotating. RY Tau and AS 209 also exhibit
double-peaked spectra characteristic of a rotating disk. Line emission from DO
Tau is dominated by high-velocity blue-shifted gas which complicates the
interpretation. Nevertheless, there is in each case sufficient evidence to
speculate that the circumstellar emission may arise from a protoplanetary disk
similar to that from which our solar system formed.

We present a quantitative analysis of the effect of microlensing caused by
random motion of individual stars in the galaxy which is lensing a background
quasar. We calculate a large number of magnification patterns for positions of
the stars slightly offset from one frame to the next, and in this way obtain
light curves for fixed quasar and galaxy positions, only due to the change in
the relative star positions. These light curves are analyzed to identify micro-
lensing events, which are classified according to height, duration, and slope.
We find that microlensing events produced by random motion of stars are
shorter, steeper, and more frequent than bulk motion events. This difference is
caused by the fact that in the case of random motion, caustics can move with
arbitrarily high velocity, producing very short events. An accompanying video
illustrates these results. For three different values of the surface mass
density kappa, it shows time sequences of 1000 magnification patterns for
slowly changing lens positions, together with the positions and velocity
vectors of the microlensing stars. Short sequences of the video are available
as MPEG movie by anonymous ftp at
ftp://astro.princeton.edu/jkw/microlensing/moving_stars .

We give an outline of possible extragalactic explanations of the highest
energy cosmic ray events. We give a classification of the possible particles
which could have caused the events and try to find suitable sources for each
class. In contrast to some previous investigations of other authors, we find a
possible candidate of a local FR-II radio galaxy close to the Fly's Eye event,
and less powerful active galaxies close to the AGASA event. We also note the
interesting coincidence that we have strong, distant quasars inside the arrival
direction error regimes of both the Fly's Eye and AGASA event. We briefly
discuss the consequences for the cosmic ray spectrum and composition at highest
energies, which could be investigated by future experiments.

Recently, the observed cellular nature of the large-scale structure of the
Universe with its quasi-regular pattern of superclusters and voids has been
pointed out by several authors. In this paper, we investigate properties of the
initial power spectrum which lead to prediction of structure consistent with
these observations.For this purpose, we analyze the evolution of structure
within four sets of 2- and 3-dimensional cosmological models, which differ in
their initial power spectrum. The models include HDM and CDM models as well as
double power-law models. We discuss in detail the impact of model parameters
such as the large scale and small scale power and the position and height of
the maxima of the power spectra on the predicted structure. The best agreement
with observations was observed in the model with the Harrison-Zeldovich
spectrum on large scales, a power index $n\approx -1.5$ on small scales, and a
maximum of the power spectrum at $\approx 130$~\Mpc. In this model the
distribution of masses of clusters and superclusters, the correlation function
of clusters, and the void distribution reproduce well the respective observed
distributions. We also investigated the dynamical evolution of the
supercluster-void structure. The results show that the basic supercluster-void
network is formed very early and is essentially given by initial conditions.

Although numerous studies of individual galaxy clusters have demonstrated the
presence of significant substructure, previous studies of the distribution of
masses of galaxy clusters determined from optical observations have failed to
explicitly correct for substructure in those systems. In this {\it Letter} I
present the distributions of velocity dispersion, mean separation, and
dynamical masses of clusters when substructure is eliminated from the cluster
datasets. I also discuss the changes in these distributions because of the
substructure correction. Comparing the masses of clusters with central galaxies
before and after correction for the presence of substructure reveals a
significant change. This change is driven by reductions in the mean separation
of galaxies, not by a decrease in the velocity dispersions as has generally
been assumed. Correction for substructure reduces most significantly the masses
of systems with cool X-ray temperatures, suggesting that the use of a constant
linear radius (1.5$h _{100} ^{-1}$ Mpc in this study) to determine cluster
membership is inappropriate for clusters spanning a range of temperatures
and/or morphologies.

We test the reliability of mass determination in clusters of galaxies by
X-ray observations. The true mass in cluster models is compared to the mass
derived by the X-ray emission and X-ray temperature of a model assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry. In general we find good
agreement between the X-ray mass and the true mass without any systematic over-
or under- estimation. The average deviation within the central 2Mpc has a
r.m.s. of 15%.

I describe a nested-grid particle-mesh (NGPM) code designed to study
gravitational instability in three-dimensions. The code is based upon a
standard PM code. Within the parent grid I am able to define smaller sub-grids
allowing us to substantially extend the dynamical range in mass and length. I
treat the fields on the parent grid as background fields and utilize a one-way
interactive meshing. Waves on the coarse parent grid are allowed to enter and
exit the subgrid, but waves from the subgrid are precluded from effecting the
dynamics of the parent grid. On the parent grid the potential is computed using
a standard multiple Fourier transform technique. On the subgrid I use a Fourier
transform technique to compute the subgrid potential at high resolution. I
impose quasi-isolated boundary conditions on the subgrid using the standard
method for generating isolated boundary conditions, but rather than using the
isolated Green function I use the Ewald method to compute a Green function on
the subgrid which possesses the full periodicity of the parent grid. I present
a detailed discussion of my methodology and a series of code tests.

Geometrical optics provides an excellent description for quasar images
crossing caustics which are formed by gravitational microlensing of objects
like Q2237+0305. Within this approximation the source size can be estimated
from the maximum magnification reached at caustic crossings. We evaluate the
limitations imposed by diffraction on caustics using the formalism developed by
Ulmer & Goodman (1995). Close to a caustic a new characteristic length, smaller
that the Fresnel length, enters the problem, limiting the angular resolution to
about 0.2 pico arcsecond, or equivalently about 3*10^9 cm at the source. To
achieve this resolution the brightness must be monitored at time intervals of a
few seconds. If a significant fraction of quasar luminosity comes from sources
smaller than those limits then interference effects would make the observed
intensity oscillate, in a close analogy with a two slit experiment. The
characteristic period of such oscillations is expected to be about one tenth of
a minute. If such oscillations are detected then photometry carried out at a
single site may permit the determination of the caustic transverse velocity,
and therefore may permit a direct conversion of the time units of brightness
variations to the linear units at the source. Subject headings: Gravitational
lensing - dark matter - quasars: structure -quasars: Q2237+0305

Supervoids are regions in the local Universe which do not contain rich
clusters of galaxies. We have studied the closest example, the Northern Local
Void, situated between the Local, Coma, and the Hercules superclusters. We find
that this supervoid is not empty, but it contains small galaxy systems and poor
clusters of galaxies. We study the cosmography of this void by analyzing the
distribution of poor clusters of galaxies, elliptical and other galaxies in two
projections. We present a catalogue of voids, defined by galaxies of different
morphological type and luminosity, and analyze mean diameters of voids in
different environments. The sizes of voids and the properties of void walls are
related. Voids defined by poor clusters of galaxies and by bright elliptical
galaxies have a mean diameter of up to 40 h-1 Mpc. Faint late-type galaxies
divide these voids into smaller voids. The faintest galaxies we can study are
outlining voids with mean diameters of about 8 h-1 Mpc. Voids located in a
high-density environment are smaller than voids in low-density regions. This
analysis shows that voids form a hierarchical system.

We review the wide range of astrophysical observations of gamma ray emission
lines and we discuss their implications. We consider line emission from solar
flares, the Orion molecular cloud complex, supernovae 1987A and 1991T, the
supernova remnants Cas A and Vela, the interstellar medium, the Galactic center
region and several Galactic black hole candidates. The observations have
important, and often unique, implications on particle acceleration, star
formation, processes of nucleosynthesis, Galactic evolution and compact object
physics.

The mass of the Galactic bulge, $M_B$, is estimated from the tensor virial
theorem. By including the effects of a barred stellar distribution and figure
rotation (81 \kms kpc $^{-1}$) and by assuming that the bar is oriented at
$\theta$ $=$ 20\deg \ to our line of sight, $M_B$ is found to be as high as
2.8$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. This estimate is in good agreement with the
total mass inferred from the observed optical depth to microlensing for stars
toward the inner Galaxy. For larger angles, $\theta$ $\sim$ 40\deg, or smaller
pattern speeds (20 \kms kpc $^{-1}$), $M_B$ is found to be $\sim$ 1.7 $-$
1.9$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, similar to previous estimates for a barred
bulge (2$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) and axisymmetric bulge
(1.8$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$).

We have imaged five 7\arcmin \x 7\arcmin\ fields in M31 spanning
galactocentric radii from 4 to 32 kpc along the SW-major axis. The fields were
observed through two broad-band (\V\ and \I) and two narrow-band (\CN\ and
\TiO) filters. The broad-band data were used to construct \IvsVI\
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and, in some of our fields, we found
significant numbers of stars in the Cepheid instability strip. A distance
modulus for the Cepheids in the middle field was found that agreed well with
other values in the literature values. The width of the giant branch (GB) in
the \IvsVI\ CMD of all 5 fields was investigated, and we show that in four of
the fields a likely explanation for the GB width is a combination of {\it both}
metallicity and mass variations. Using the broad-band data, the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) luminosity functions (LFs) were measured in the five fields,
and we show that differences exist between these LFs. We speculate on how the
different star forming histories in the fields may lead to the observed AGB LFs
and GB widths. Using the narrow-band data along with the broad-band data we
separated the AGB stars into carbon-rich (C) and oxygen-rich (M) types. The
carbon stars LFs were used to obtain an estimate for the distance modulus of
M31 which agrees with the value derived from Cepheids. The ratio of C- to
M-stars (C/M) is believed to be an indicator of gaseous chemical abundance at
the time of formation of these stars. We show that the C/M ratio increases
smoothly with galactocentric distance, suggesting an inverse correlation with
metallicity. This is the first demonstration of this effect within a single
extragalactic system. We find that differences in the width of the GB and the
AGB LFs do not significantly affect the C/M ratio. We consider the effect of
the increasing C/M ratio on the ISM in M31, and cite evidence in favor of a
model where the grain composition in M31 is a function of galactocentric
distance.

We report observations of PSR's 0740-28, 1737-30, 1822-09, 1915+13 and
1916+14 with ROSAT. In the 0.1-2.1 keV range upper limits to luminosity are
derived for power law and blackbody spectra, using a range of $N_{H}$
estimates. The upper limit to the blackbody luminosity from PSR1822-09 turns
out to be consistent with standard cooling curves. For the other pulsars the
upper limits are not restrictive as they are much larger than the luminosities
predicted by the models.

We present spectra of the brightest member of the population of compact blue
objects discovered in the peculiar galaxy NGC 1275 by Holtzman et al. using
Hubble Space Telescope images. These spectra show strong Balmer absorption
lines like those observed in A-type stars, as expected if the object is a young
globular cluster. The age estimated from the strength of the Balmer lines is
about 0.5 Gyr, although ages ranging from 0.1 Gyr to 0.9 Gyr can not be
confidently excluded given current models of stellar populations. If these
estimated ages are adopted for the young cluster population of NGC 1275 as a
whole, the fading predicted by stellar populations models gives a luminosity
function which is consistent with that of the Galactic globular cluster system
convolved with the observational selection function for the NGC 1275 system. We
also use the equivalent widths of the Mg $b$ and Fe 5270 features to constrain
the metallicity of the young cluster. Combining these absorption-line widths
with the age estimates from the Balmer lines and stellar population models, we
find a metallicity of roughly solar based on the Mg $b$ index and somewhat
higher for the Fe 5270 index. The radial velocity of the absorption lines of
the cluster spectrum is offset from the emission lines of the galaxy spectrum
at the same position by $-130$ \kms, providing further evidence for the
identification of the object as a globular cluster, and opening up the future
possibility of studying the kinematics of young cluster systems. The discovery
of objects with the characteristics of young globular clusters in NGC 1275,
which shows evidence of a recent interaction or merger, supports the hypothesis
that galaxy interactions and mergers are favorable sites for the formation of
globular clusters.

We present the rotation curves of 967 spiral galaxies, obtained by
deprojecting and folding the raw data published by Mathewson et al. (1992). Of
these, 80 meet objective excellence criteria and are suitable for individual
detailed mass modelling, while 820 are suitable for statistical studies. A
preliminary analysis of theire properties confirms that rotation curves are a
universal function of luminosity and that the dark matter fraction in spirals
increase with decreasing luminosity. Quantitative considerations on the virial
radius of dark halos allow us to make hypotheses about their structure and
nature. The deprojected folded curves, the smoothed curves, and various related
quantities are available via anonymous ftp at
ftp://galileo.sissa.it/users/ftp/pub/psrot

We consider the effects of stellar magnetic cycles on disc accretion in T
Tauri stars where the inner region of the disc is disrupted by the stellar
field. Using time-dependent disc models, we show that order unity variations in
field strength can strongly modulate the accretion flow for cycle time-scales
of years to decades. Photometric variability is expected to be greatest in the
ultraviolet, with smaller but still significant variations probable in the
near-infrared. We suggest that variable stellar magnetic fields may contribute
to the long-time-scale photometric variability of T Tauri stars. The long-term
variability of T Tauri stars may therefore provide a clue to the nature of
magnetic dynamo cycles in these stars.

We consider the tidal excitation of modes in a binary system of arbitrary
eccentricity. For a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forced
oscillation with a period equal to the orbital period ($T$). For an eccentric
orbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximately
as the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the mode
frequency and a `static' term that follows the time dependence of the tidal
forcing function. The oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing
$\b$ (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period),
whereas the `static' term is independent of $\b$. For small $\b$ modes ($\b
\approx 1$), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the mode
amplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. For large $\b$ modes ($\b \gta$ a
few), the oscillatory term is very small compared to the `static' term, in
which case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distance
cubed. For main sequence stars, $p$, $f$, and low order $g$-modes generally
have large $\b$ and hence small amplitudes of oscillation. High overtone
$g$-modes, however, have small overlap with the tidal forcing function. Thus,
we expect an intermediate overtone $g$-mode with $\b \sim 1$ to have the
largest oscillation amplitude. The dependence on mode damping and the stellar
rotation rate is considered, as well as the effects of orbital evolution. We
apply our work to the two binary pulsar system: PSR J0045-7319 and PSR
B1259-63.

With the advent of the COBE detection of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation, the study of inhomogeneous cosmology has entered a new
phase. It is now possible to accurately normalize fluctuations on the largest
observable scales, in the linear regime. In this paper we present a
model-independent method of normalizing theories to the full COBE data. This
technique allows an extremely wide range of theories to be accurately
normalized to COBE in a very simple and fast way. We give the best fitting
normalization and relative peak likelihoods for a range of spectral shapes, and
discuss the normalization for several popular theories. Additionally we present
both Bayesian and frequentist measures of the goodness of fit of a
representative range of theories to the COBE data.

Using the archival ROSAT observation of TT Ari, X-ray energy spectra in
different orbital phases and power spectra of the intensity time series are
presented. Spectral fits show that the source gets brighter during the
observation. The orbital modulation of the X-ray counting rate and
bremsstrahlung temperature suggests that soft X-ray emission peaks in the
orbital phase interval 0.75-0.90, when an outer disk hot spot is near the line
of sight. This correlates with the orbital modulation of C IV($\lambda$1549)
absorption. Timing analysis indicates that while the source gets brighter, the
frequency of the 1mHz oscillation is not correlated with X-ray intensity. This
implies that in the X-rays from TT Ari, the beat frequency model is not
appropriate for explaining the changes in the 1mHz oscillations.

Gerhard had recently analyzed the data on seven dwarf spheroidals, and
concluded that these disagree with the predictions of MOND. We contend that
this conclusion is anything but correct. With new data for three of the dwarfs
the observations of all dwarfs are in compelling agreement with the predictions
of MOND. Gerhard found MOND M/L values that fall around a few solar units, as
expected if MOND is a valid alternative to dark matter. His sole cause for
complaint was that some of his MOND M/L values were still outside the range of
``reasonable'' stellar values. This, we say, was easily attributable to
uncertainties in the data, such as in the velocity dispersions, luminosities,
core radii, etc., and in the assumptions that underlie the analysis, such as
isotropic velocity distribution, light-distribution fits, etc.. There are now
new, much improved determinations of the velocity dispersions for three of the
dwarfs, in particular for the two dwarfs for which Gerhard found high MOND M/L
values. In fact, within just the quoted errors on the velocity dispersions and
the luminosities, the MOND M/L values for all seven dwarfs are now perfectly
consistent with stellar values, with no need for dark matter.

We study the origin of iron and alpha-elements (O, Mg, Si) in clusters of
galaxies. In particular, we discuss the [O/Fe] ratio and the iron
mass-to-luminosity ratio in the intracluster medium (ICM) and their link to the
chemical and dynamical evolution of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. We
adopt a detailed model of galactic evolution incorporating the development of
supernovae- driven galactic winds which pollute the ICM with enriched ejecta.
We demonstrate \it quantitatively \rm the crucial dependence upon the assumed
stellar initial mass function in determining the evolution of the mass and
abundances ratios of heavy elements in typical model ICMs. We show that
completely opposite behaviours of [alpha/Fe] ratios (\ie positive versus
negative ratios) can be obtained by varying the initial mass function without
altering the classic assumptions regarding type Ia supernovae progenitors or
their nucleosynthesis. Our results indicate that models incorporating somewhat
flatter-than-Salpeter initial mass functions (ie x approx 1, as opposed to
x=1.35) are preferred, provided the intracluster medium iron mass-to-luminosity
ratio, preliminary [alpha/Fe]>0 ASCA results, and present-day type Ia
supernovae rates, are to be matched. A simple Virgo cluster simulation which
adheres to these constraints shows that approx 70% of the measured ICM iron
mass has its origin in type II supernovae, with the remainder being synthesized
in type Ia systems.

We recently reported strong evidence for solar-like oscillations in the G0 IV
star eta Boo (Kjeldsen et al. 1995, AJ 109, 1313). We measured small
temperature fluctuations produced by oscillations through their effect on the
equivalent widths of the Balmer lines. Here we address several issues that were
raised at this conference. In particular, we show a power spectrum made without
applying a high-pass filter to the observations. This spectrum shows increased
noise at low frequencies, as expected, and the oscillation signature is still
clearly visible.

We present radial velocities for approximately 40 stars in each of three
optically obscured, off-axis, fields toward the Galactic bulge. Combined with
the data presented by Blum et al. (1994), we now have mean radial velocities
and radial velocity dispersions in four fields towards the Galactic bulge.
These four fields lie nearly along an axis whose position angle from the major
axis of the Galaxy is 55\deg. The observed kinematics generally match both
Kent's (1992) axisymmetric and Zhao's (1994) barred dynamical model
predictions, but are marginally better described by the latter. The velocity
dispersion in our innermost field is high, 153 $\pm$ 17 \kms. Our data,
combined with that from previous studies at larger radii, suggest that the
stellar velocity dispersion is flat or still rising at projected radius R \aple
150 pc.

During the final evolution of most stars, they shed their outer skin and
expose their core of the hot ashes of nuclear burning. As these hot and very
dense cores cool into white dwarf stars, they go through episodes of
multiperiodic, nonradial g-mode pulsation. The tools of stellar seismology
allow us to use the pulsation spectra as powerful probes into the deep
interiors of these stars. Progress in white dwarf seismology has required
significant international cooperation, since another consequence of the complex
pulsations of these stars is decoding the true pulsation frequencies requires a
coordinated global effort involving high-speed photometric observations.
Through one such effort, the Whole Earth Telescope project, we have located
subsurface composition changes, detected differential rotation and magnetic
fields, and measured fundamental quantities such as stellar mass, luminosity,
and distance to extraordinary accuracy.

A stellar population synthesis model, suitable for comparison with Giant
Extragalactic HII Regions (GEHRs), is constructed incorporating the recent
developments in modelling stellar evolution by Maeder and co-workers and
stellar atmospheres by Kurucz. A number of quantities suitable for comparison
with broad band data of GEHRs in visible and near infrared parts of the
spectrum are synthesized in addition to the hydrogen and helium ionizing photon
production rates at solar metallicities, for three scenarios of star formation
--- (i) Instantaneous burst (IB) (ii) Continuous star formation (CSF) and (iii)
Two bursts of star formation, with the older burst rich in red supergiants. For
IB case, evolution of colors shows three distinct phases --- an initial steady
blue phase, followed by a red bump (5--15~Myr) and another steady phase with
colors intermediate to the earlier two phases. CSF colors asymptotically reach
peak values at $\sim 10$~Myr, never reaching the reddest IB colors. Ionizing
photon production rate falls off by an order of magnitude in 6~Myr for IB,
where as it almost remains constant for CSF model. Two-burst models with burst
separations $\sim 10$~Myr have properties of both IB and CSF, simultaneously
producing the red IB colors and high ionizing photon rate, making such regions
easily distinguishable using optical observations. Flat IMFs result in bluest
colors when the massive stars are on the main sequence and reddest colors
during the red supergiant phase of the evolving massive stars. Errors on the
computed quantities due to the statistical uncertainties inherent in the
process of star formation become negligible for cluster masses in excess of
$10^5$\,\msun.

In this paper, by considering a simple fluid model, we investigate the role
of phase transitions in the ISM on the galaxy scale gas dynamics. Cooling and
heating timescales in the ISM are typically shorter than typical galactic
rotation timescales, so the individual phases in the ISM can be assumed to be
in temperature equilibrium with the radiation field. Using this approximation
we can construct an equation of state which depends upon the average density
and mass fractions in the individual phases. Previous studies suggest that
there is an equilibrium phase fraction as a function of pressure. We
incorporate evolution towards this equilibrium state as a relaxation term with
a time to obtain equilibrium $\tau$. We derive a condition in terms of a
critical Mach number when one dimensional shocks should be continuous. For
small values of the relaxation time $\tau$ we show that the relaxation term
acts like a viscosity. We show with one dimensional simulations that increasing
$\tau$ causes shocks to become smoother. This work suggests that phase changes
can strongly effect the gas dynamics of the ISM across spiral arms and bars.

We present HST imaging of eight spectroscopically-confirmed giant arcs, pairs
and arclets. These objects have all been extensively studied from the ground
and we demonstrate the unique advantages of HST imaging in the study of such
features by a critical comparison of our data with the previous observations.
In particular we present new estimates of the core radii of two clusters
(Cl0024+16, A370) determined from lensed features which are identifiable in our
HST images. Although our HST observations include both pre- and
post-refurbishment images, the depth of the exposures guarantees that the
majority of the arcs are detected with diffraction-limited resolution. A number
of the objects in our sample are multiply-imaged and we illustrate the ease of
identification of such features when working at high resolution. We discuss the
morphological and scale information on these distant field galaxies in the
light of HST studies of lower redshift samples. We conclude that the dominant
population of star-forming galaxies at z=1 is a factor of 1.5-2 times smaller
than the similar group in the local field. This implies either a considerable
evolution in the sizes of star-forming galaxies within the last $\sim$10 Gyrs
or a shift in the relative space densities of massive and dwarf star-forming
systems over the same timescale.

We present the first results of a serendipitous search for clusters of
galaxies in deep ROSAT-PSPC pointed observations at high galactic latitude. The
survey is being carried out using a Wavelet based Detection Algorithm which is
not biased against extended, low surface brightness sources. A new
flux--diameter limited sample of 10 cluster candidates has been created from
$\rm\sim 3 \, deg^2$ surveyed area. Preliminary CCD observations have revealed
that a large fraction of these candidates correspond to a visible enhancement
in the galaxy surface density, and several others have been identified from
other surveys. We believe these sources to be either low--moderate redshift
groups or intermediate to high redshift clusters. We show X-ray and optical
images of some of the clusters identified to date. We present, for the first
time, the derived number density of the galaxy clusters to a flux limit of $\rm
1\cdot 10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ (0.5--2.0 keV). This extends the $\log
N$--$\log S$ of previous cluster surveys by more than one decade in flux.
Results are compared to theoretical predictions for cluster number counts.

Three new photometric CCD-based datasets are presented for NGC~6791. They
consist of deep UBV photometry (to $V_{lim} =24$, $B_{lim}=24$, $U_{lim} = 23$)
of the central parts of the cluster and of selected fields around it, and of
relatively shallower UBVI photometry for the whole cluster ($23' \times 23'$).
The data have been used to discuss the reddening, metallicity and age
ofNGC~6791, a cluster which is particularly important because of (1)~its
most-advanced age among open clusters, (2)~metallicity higher than solar and
(3)~particularly large number of member stars. We discovered two new very blue
stars increasing the total of sdB objects in the cluster to ten. They are
located in a very narrow range magnitudes $V=17.7 \pm 0.5$; their blue colors
strongly constrain our determination of the reddening of the cluster to
$E(B-V)=0.17 \pm 0.01$. We detected no other blue stars except a population of
faint objects with $V \approx 22$ in the center of the cluster. We have used
the new theoretical isochrones in a differential determination of metallicity
and age of NGC~6791 using M67 and NGC~188 as two clusters with well-known
abundaces and age. We find $[Fe/H] \simeq +0.5$ and age by 1~Gyr older than
that of NGC~188. The luminosity function of the cluster is surpisingly flat
while the ``secondary'' main-sequence of equal-mass binaries is weaker than in
less-populous old open clusters. We explain both features by the large total
mass of the cluster which has lead to weak evaporation of low-mass and single
stars from the cluster.

We present visible and near-infrared images of the amorphous dwarf galaxy NGC
1705 in the $B$, $V$, $R$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands. Optical and near infrared
colors in the galaxy are consistent with a composite population with colors
similar to those of the bluest Sc nuclei. The contribution of young stars to
the disk population of the galaxy decreases outwards from the center. In the
near infrared images we detect three unresolved point sources, two of which
have colors and luminosities comparable to intermediate age LMC clusters.

We present $B,V,R,J,H,K$ broad--band images of the barred galaxy NGC 1097.
The optical and infrared colors maps trace the location of the major dust
features. The dust lanes are relatively free of star formation and have low
opacity. The depth of the dust lanes decreases as a function of wavelength so
that they are deepest at $B$ and shallower at $H$ and $K$ where they are
difficult to detect. We find that the dust lane on the north-west side of the
galaxy has colors consistent with those of a dust screen with opacity derived
from the galactic extinction law. Thus, it must be located on the near side of
the galaxy. The colors in the dust lane on the south-east side of the galaxy,
on the other hand, suggest that there are stars both in front of and behind the
dust, consistent with this dust lane being located on the far side of the
galaxy. Near the inner spiral ring (at $\sim 17'' = 1.4$kpc from the nucleus),
the dust lane becomes double peaked with peak to valley extinction ratio
similar to that observed in radio continuum by Ondrechen and van der Hulst
(1983). This suggests that if the cold diffuse component of the interstellar
medium (traced by the dust) moves with the cosmic ray electron component then
the magnetic field pressure is not a significant force in the shocks.
Alternatively if the two phases do not move together a more detailed comparison
may show differences in the shock shapes. From the $K$ images, we estimate that
the total stellar mass of the star forming spiral ring at a radius of $\sim$
1kpc from the nucleus is of the same order as the molecular gas mass in the
ring. The infrared images show a short bar inside the inner spiral ring. In the
principal plane of the galaxy, the short bar is not perpendicular to the
prominent outer bar. This suggests that there are torques between the inner bar
and the spiral

Highly collimated supersonic jets are observed to emerge from a wide variety
of astrophysical objects, ranging from Active Nuclei of Galaxies (AGN's) to
Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) within our own Galaxy. Despite their different
physical scales (in size, velocity, and amount of energy transported), they
have strong morphological similarities. Thanks to the proximity and relatively
small timescales, which permit direct observations of evolutionary changes, YSO
jets are, perhaps, the best laboratories for cosmic jet investigation. In this
lecture, the formation, structure, and evolution of the YSO jets are reviewed
with the help of observational information, MHD and purely hydrodynamical
modeling, and numerical simulations. Possible applications of the models to AGN
jets are also addressed.

We discuss several constraints on the properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) at
cosmological distances. First we use the requirement that burst sources must be
optically thin to pair production by photon-photon collisions in order to
produce the observed nonthermal spectra. We derive probability distributions
for the minimum Lorentz expansion factor, the radiation energy, the maximum
baryonic mass, and the maximum surrounding gas density in the events, based on
254 events from the second BATSE catalog. Secondly, the time variabilities of
the bursts in the BATSE catalog are used to place an upper bound on the
curvature radius of the emitting surface in the events. This is based on the
requirement that the emitting region seen by the observer must be sufficiently
small to produce the observed variability without violating causality. Finally,
we discuss the association of cosmological GRB with galaxies. We consider eight
bright and well-localized bursts detected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, whose
positional error boxes contain no bright galaxies. Using the local luminosity
function of galaxies, we calculate the probability for not seeing the GRB host
galaxy. This probability tends to increase as the width of the GRB luminosity
function increases. However, the allowed width of the GRB luminosity function
is restricted by the number-count statistics of the bursts.

Johnson {\it BV} CCD observations have been made of the young Large
Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC~2214 and a nearby field using the Anglo-Australian
Telescope. It has been suggested in the literature that this elliptical cluster
is actually two clusters in the process of merging. No evidence is found from
profile fitting or the colour--magnitude diagrams to support this contention.
Completeness factors are estimated for the CCD frames. These values are used in
conjunction with luminosity functions to estimate the initial mass function
(IMF) for NGC~2214. A power law is assumed for the IMF, with a good fit being
found for the exponent (1 + $x$) = 2.01~$\pm$ 0.09. There is some indication
that the low-mass end (less than or equal to 3 Solar Masses) has a lower
gradient than the high-mass end of the derived IMF. This value is in reasonable
agreement with literature values for other Magellanic IMFs, and not
substantially different from those of the poorly determined Galactic IMFs,
suggesting the possibility of a `universal' IMF over the Magellanic Clouds and
our Galaxy in the mass range $\sim 1$ to $\sim 10$ Solar Masses.

Relying on samples of disk galaxies for which a detailed photometric
bulge/disk decomposition has been provided in the literature, we examine the
dependence of the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio (B/D) on the blue absolute
luminosity and on the environmental density. In our statistical analysis of
various B/D data sets we pay particular attention to disentangling the role
played by the galaxy morphology--galaxy density relation. Besides, we focus our
attention on nearby ($z<0.01$) galaxies, for which we can provide a
three-dimensional characterization of the local galaxy density. We find that
the observed tendency of galaxies to have greater B/D with increasing galaxy
density simply reflects the average decline of B/D towards later morphological
types together with the morphology--density relation. This relation tends to
give rise also to a greater proportion of bright bulges in denser regions,
because the decrease of B/D towards later types is mostly due to a dimming of
the bulge rather than to a brightening of the disk. But when we remove the
effect induced by the morphology--density relation, we detect no clear evidence
of a dependence of B/D on galaxy density. Furthermore, B/D turns out to be
substantially unrelated to the blue absolute magnitude of the galaxy. We
briefly discuss to what extent our results (partially) disagree with previous
claims.

We report a significant detection of weak, tangential distortion of the
images of cosmologically distant, faint galaxies due to gravitational lensing
by foreground galaxies. A mean image polarisation of $<p>=0.011\pm 0.006$ is
measured for 3202 pairs of source galaxies with magnitudes $23< r \le 24$ and
lens galaxies with magnitudes $20\le r\le 23$. The signal remains strong for
lens-source separations $\lo 90''$, consistent with quasi-isothermal galaxy
halos extending to large radii ($\go 100h^{-1}$ kpc). Our observations thus
provide the first evidence from weak gravitational lensing of large scale dark
halos associated with individual galaxies. The observed polarisation is also
consistent with the signal expected on the basis of simulations incorporating
measured properties of local galaxies and modest extrapolations of the observed
redshift distribution of faint galaxies. From the simulations we derive a
best-fit halo circular velocity of $V\sim 220$ km/s and characteristic radial
extent of $s \go 100h^{-1}$ kpc. Our best-fit halo parameters imply typical
masses for the lens galaxies within a radius of $100h^{-1}$ kpc on the order of
$1.0^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\times 10^{12}h^{-1} M_\odot$, in good agreement with recent
dynamical estimates of the masses of local spiral galaxies. This is
particularly encouraging as the lensing and dynamical mass estimators rely on
different sets of assumptions. Contamination of the gravitational lensing
signal by a population of tidally distorted satellite galaxies can be ruled out
with reasonable confidence. The prospects for corroborating and improving this
measurement seem good, especially using deep HST archival data.

A review of the principles of observational testing of cosmological theories
is given with a special emphasis on the distinction between observational facts
and theoretical hypotheses. A classification of modern cosmological theories
and possible observational tests for these theories is presented. The main
rival cosmological models are analyzed from the point of view of observational
testing of their initial hypothesis. A comparison of modern observational data
with theoretical predictions is presented. In particular we discuss in detail
the validity of the two basic assumptions of modern cosmology that are the
Cosmological Principle and the Expanding Space Paradigm. It is found that
classical paradigms need to be reanalyzed and that it is necessary to develop
crucial cosmological tests to discriminate alternative theories.

Whether the H II regions of dwarf emission-line galaxies are self-polluted by
the nucleosynthetic products of massive stars remains an open question, despite
recent claims to the contrary. We show that the finding by Kunth and
collaborators that the neutral interstellar medium of I Zw 18 has a metallicity
one order of magnitude lower than that of the ionized gas is highly uncertain.
The range of possible values of (O/H) admitted by the saturated O I absorption
line used in their analysis is very large, spanning a factor of the order of
1000. We suggest that future observations of the intrinsically weaker S II 1256
multiplet offer the best prospects for measuring the true degree of metal
enrichment of this dwarf galaxy.

Near infrared light at 2 micrometers is relatively insensitive to the
presence of hot young stars and dust in galaxies, and there has been recent
interest in using it as a mass tracer in spiral galaxies. I present evidence
that young, cool supergiant stars, whose presence is indicated by strong CO
absorption in a 2.36 micrometer bandpass, dominate the 2 micrometer light from
active star forming regions in the galaxy NGC 1309. The galaxy's quiescent
regions, in contrast, do not show evidence of young supergiants. It follows
that the 2 micrometer light comes from different stellar populations in
different places, and large changes in the 2 micrometer surface brightness need
not imply correspondingly large features in the galaxy's mass distribution.

We study the evolution of the power spectrum of gravitational potential
during the nonlinear clustering in an $\Omega=1$ matter dominated phase. N-body
simulations suggest that the potential does not evolve in time even in the
quasilinear phase for an $n=-1$ power spectrum. For $n=-2$, the potential
evolves in the quasilinear phase but not in the extreme nonlinear phase.
Becauase of these facts, the evolution of the gravitational potential in
spectra like CDM is less than what would have been expected naively. We discuss
a class of CDM like models in which such an interesting conspiracy between the
amplitude and local index occurs.

We consider the current flow in an accreting rotating neutron star (X-ray
pulsator) and propose that the active magnetosphere is limited by the Alfv\`en
surface. Formulae for the luminosity and torque due to currents circulating in
the neutron star are given, and astrophysical consequences for systems like Her
X-1 and LMXRB are shortly discussed.

We discuss a possible delay experienced by protogalaxies with low column
density of gas in forming stars over large scales. After the hydrogen has
recombined, as the external ionizing UV flux decreases and the metal abundance
$Z$ increases, the HI, initially in the warm phase ($T\simgt 5000$ K), makes a
transition to the cool phase ($T\simlt 100$ K). The minimum abundance $Z_{min}$
for which this phase transition takes place in a small fraction of the Hubble
time decreases rapidly with increasing gas column density. Therefore in the
``anemic'' disk galaxies, where $N_{HI}$ is up to ten times smaller than for
normal large spirals, the onset of the cool HI phase is delayed. The onset of
gravitational instability is also delayed, since these objects are more likely
to be gravitationally stable in the warm phase than progenitors of today's
large spiral galaxies. The first substantial burst of star formation may occur
only as late as at redshifts $z \sim 0.5$ and give a temporary high peak
luminosity, which may be related to the ``faint blue objects". Galaxy disks of
lower column density tend to have lower escape velocities and a
starburst/galactic fountain instability which decreases the gas content of the
inner disk drastically.

We present a linear analysis of acoustic and thermo-reactive instabilities in
a diffuse gas, photoionized and heated by a radiation field, cooled by
collisional excitation of hydrogen and metal lines. The hydrogen recombination
reaction has a stabilizing effect on the thermal mode found by Field (1965)
since the condensation instability occurs in a narrower region of the parameter
space and grows on longer time scales due to its oscillatory character. This
effect is stronger when the mean photon energy is not much larger than the
hydrogen ionization energy. Moreover, for fixed values of thermal pressure and
photoionization rate, there are thermo- reactive unstable equilibria for which
no transition to a stable phase is possible. By extending our analysis of the
thermo-reactive modes to the nonlinear regime we show that when no phase
transition is possible the medium evolves through a series of nonequilibrium
states characterized by large amplitude, nonlinear periodic oscillations of
temperature, density and hydrogen ionization fraction. We find also unstable
acoustic waves which, for solar metal abundances, are the fastest growing modes
in two temperature intervals: around $T\sim 100$~K and $T\sim 8000$~K (i.e.
cold and warm phase, respectively), independent of the mean photon energy.
Possible implications for the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium are
briefly outlined.

Lithium abundances in a sample of halo dwarfs have been redetermined by using
the new T$_{eff}$ derived by Fuhrmann et al (1994) from modelling of the Balmer
lines. These T$_{eff}$ are reddening independent, homogeneous and of higher
quality than those based on broad band photometry. Abundances have been derived
by generating new atmospheric models by using the ATLAS-9 code by Kurucz (1993)
with enhanced $\alpha$-elements and without the overshooting option. The
revised abundances show a remarkably flat {\it plateau} in the Li-T$_{eff}$
plane for T$_{eff}$$>$ 5700 K with no evidence of trend with T$_{eff}$ or
falloff at the hottest edge. Li abundances are not correlated with metallicity
for [Fe/H]$<$ -1.4 in contrast with Thorburn (1994). All the determinations are
consistent with the same pristine lithium abundance and the errors estimated
for individual stars fully account for the observed dispersion. The weighted
average Li value for the 24 stars of the plateau with T$_{eff}$$> $ 5700 K and
[Fe/H]$\le$ -1.4, is [Li] = 2.210 $\pm$ 0.013, or 2.224 when non-LTE
corrections by Carlsson et al (1994) are considered.

We report on multifrequency radio observations made with the Effelsberg 100-m
telescope, the IRAM 30-m telescope and the Green Bank Interferometer between
1992 and 1994 of the $\gamma$-ray quasar 0528+134. We present a new VLBI based
map of 0518+134 at 22 GHz with sub-mas angular resolution observed in November
1992, which shows a one-sided core jet structure of $\sim$ 5 mas length. One
component, seen also previously at 8.4 GHz & 22 GHz, shows apparent
superluminal motion with $\beta_{app}$=4.4$\pm$1.7. In summer 1993 we observed
a major outburst at all frequencies higher than a few GHz, which peaked a few
months after a strong outburst in high energy $\gamma$-rays and showed the
canonical time evolution of a cooling and/or expanding electron distribution.
Our data indicate that the outburst in the EGRET range originated very close to
the central object of the AGN and that a remnant of this outburst moved further
outward in the jet until it became optically thin at radio frequencies after a
few months. During the flare in July 1993 we observed with the Effelsberg 100-m
telescope an unusually strong decrease of the flux density by about 50% at 4.75
GHz and 10.55 GHz and slightly less at 2.695 GHz. This behaviour is also seen
in the monitoring data at 2.25 GHz and 8.3 GHz taken with the Green Bank
Interferometer (NRL-GBI). An extreme scattering event by a small dense plasma
cloud in the line of sight is able to match the observed time lag in the
lightcurves if we take into account the mas-structure of the source and
different spectra of the components on the basis of their brightness in the
VLBI maps.

Since the WFPC-2 undersamples the PSF, aperture photometry can produce
results which are competetive with profile fitting in many situations. This
article reports and investigation of aperture corrections using both real data
and PSF models.

An objective prism H alpha survey has shown that there is a population of
early type spiral galaxies in nearby clusters with strong central bursts of
star formation which could be due to galaxy--galaxy tidal interactions. Such
galaxies are rarely found in the field.

Unidentified extreme UV sources, detected in the {\it EUVE} and {\it ROSAT}
WFC all-sky surveys, could be isolated old neutron stars, accreting material
from the ISM. The closest neutron stars, that are located in the local ISM
bubble of unusually low density, are faint and cool ($L \sim 10^{27} {\rm \ erg
\ s^{-1}}$, $T \sles 6 $eV). The extreme UV spectrum of these sources is very
sensitive to the H I column density, since large fraction of the emission is
emitted just below the hydrogen Lyman edge. The {\it EUVE} sources with large
count rate in the long-wave bandpass (600\AA) seem to be the most promising
candidates. These sources should have low H I column density ($N_{HI} \sles
10^{18} {\rm \ cm^{-2}}$), constraining their distance to a few tens of parsec.
Otherwise, their spectra would be significantly modified by ISM absorption,
inevitably become stronger in the short wavelength (100\AA, 200\AA) {\it EUVE}
bandpasses. If these unidentified objects are familiar EUV sources rather than
neutron stars, either white dwarfs, late type stars or cataclysmic variables,
they are expected to be identifiable, generally brighter than $\sim 14$.

We study the resonant divergences that occur in quantum scattering
cross-sections in the presence of a strong external magnetic field. We
demonstrate that all such divergences may be eliminated by introducing
radiative corrections to the leading-order scattering amplitudes. These
corrections impose a choice of basis states that must be used in scattering
calculations: electron states must diagonalize the mass operator, while photon
states must diagonalize the polarization operator. The radiative corrections
introduce natural line-widths into the energy denominators of all propagators,
as well as into the time-development exponentials of all scattering states
corresponding to external lines. Since initial and final scattering states may
now decay, it is logically necessary to compute scattering amplitudes for a
finite time-lapse between the preparation of the initial state and the
measurement of the final state. Strict energy conservation, which appeared in
previous formulations of the theory, must thus be abandoned. We exhibit the
generic formulae for the scattering cross-sections in two useful limits,
corresponding to the cases where either the initial states or the final states
are stable, and discuss the application of the general formula when neither of
these limits applies.

N-body simulations that follow only a collisionless dark matter component
have failed to produce galaxy halos or substructure within dense environments.
We investigate the `over-merging' problem analytically and with numerical
simulations, by calculating dissolution timescales of halos due to physical and
artificial dynamical effects. The numerical resolution that has recently been
attained is such that mass-loss from two-body relaxation is negligible. We
demonstrate that substructure is destroyed in present simulations as a result
of large force softening combined with the heating sources of tides and
encounters with dissolving substructure. In the limit of infinite numerical
resolution, whether or not individual halos or substructure can survive depends
sensitively on their inner density profiles. Singular isothermal halos will
always survive at some level, however, if halos form with large core radii then
the over-merging problem will always exist within dissipationless N-body
simulations. In this latter case a dissipational component can increase the
halos central density enabling galaxies to survive.

We have obtained high signal:to:noise optical spectroscopy at 5\AA\
resolution of 27 quasars from the APM z$>$4 quasar survey. The spectra have
been analyzed to create new samples of high redshift Lyman-limit and damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. These data have been combined with published data
sets in a study of the redshift evolution and the column density distribution
function for absorbers with $\log$N(HI)$\ge17.5$, over the redshift range 0.01
$<$ z $<$ 5. The main results are: \begin{itemize} \item Lyman limit systems:
The data are well fit by a power law $N(z) = N_0(1 + z)^{\gamma}$ for the
number density per unit redshift. For the first time intrinsic evolution is
detected in the product of the absorption cross-section and comoving spatial
number density for an $\Omega = 1$ Universe. We find $\gamma = 1.55$ ($\gamma =
0.5$ for no evolution) and $N_0 = 0.27$ with $>$99.7\% confidence limits for
$\gamma$ of 0.82 \& 2.37. \item Damped \lya systems: The APM QSOs provide a
substantial increase in the redshift path available for damped surveys for
$z>3$. Eleven candidate and three confirmed damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption
systems, have been identified in the APM QSO spectra covering the redshift
range $2.8\le z \le 4.4$ (11 with $z>3.5$). Combining the APM survey confirmed
and candidate damped \lya absorbers with previous surveys, we find evidence for
a turnover at z$\sim$3 or a flattening at z$\sim$2 in the cosmological mass
density of neutral gas, $\Omega_g$. \end{itemize} The Lyman limit survey
results are published in Storrie-Lombardi, et~al., 1994, ApJ, 427, L13. Here we
describe the results for the DLA population of absorbers.

In the past few years, the Magellanic Clouds have been the targets for
several major variable star surveys. The results of these surveys are now
becoming available and it is clear that a Renaissance in LMC and SMC variable
star research will result. In this review, I will describe the results of such
surveys and review the questions that are likely to be answered by further
work.
  With respect to results, I will concentrate on LMC MACHO Project data,
including beat Cepheids, discovery statistics, mode identification, Fourier
decomposition of lightcurves, and the differences between the LMC and galactic
sample.

In 1989, an air-borne experiments (VEGA experiment) aiming at the detection
of a few 10 GeV $\gamma$-ray were carried out. In these experiments, nine
point-source candidates along the Galactic plane were reported. In these
candidates, the five of five highest significance candidates positionally
coincide with the EGRET galactic plane sources.

The formation of low surface brightness galaxies is an unavoidable prediction
of any hierarchical clustering scenario. In these models, low surface
brightness galaxies form at late times from small initial overdensities, and
make up most of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. Because there
are tremendous observational biases against finding low surface brightness
galaxies, the observed faint end of the galaxy luminosity function may easily
fall short of predictions, if hierarchical structure formation is correct. We
calculate the number density and mass density in collapsed objects as a
function of baryonic surface density and redshift, and show that the mass in
recently formed low surface brightness galaxies can be comparable to the mass
bound into ``normal'' high surface brightness galaxies. Because of their low
gas surface densities, these galaxies are easily ionized by the UV background
and are not expected to appear in HI surveys. Low surface brightness galaxies
(LSBs) are not a special case of galaxy formation and are perhaps better viewed
as a continuance of the Hubble sequence.

We consider the production of $^3$He and $^2$H by $^4$He photodisintegration
initiated by non-thermal energy releases during early cosmic epochs. We find
that this process cannot be the predominant source of primordial $^2$H since it
would result in anomalously high $^3$He/D ratios in conflict with standard
chemical evolution assumptions. We apply this fact to constrain topological
defect models of highest energy cosmic ray (HECR) production. Such models have
been proposed as possible sources of ultrahigh energy particles and gamma-rays
with energies above $10^{20}$eV. The constraints on these models derived from
$^4$He-photodisintegration are compared to corresponding limits from spectral
distortions of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and from the
observed diffuse gamma-ray background. It is shown that for reasonable primary
particle injection spectra superconducting cosmic strings, unlike ordinary
strings or annihilating monopoles, cannot produce the HECR flux at the present
epoch without violating at least the $^4$He-photodisintegration bound. The
constraint from the diffuse gamma-ray background rules out the dominant
production of HECR by the decay of Grand Unification particles in models with
cosmological evolution assuming standard fragmentation functions. Constraints
on massive black hole induced photodisintegration are also discussed.

An extensive set of N-body simulations has been carried out on the
gravitational interaction of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the Galaxy
and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The SMC is assumed to have been a barred
galaxy with a disc-to-halo mass ratio of unity before interaction and modelled
by a large number of self-gravitating particles, whereas the Galaxy and LMC
have been represented by rigid spherical potentials. The best model we have
found succeeded in reproducing the Magellanic Stream (MS), as well as a leading
counterpart to the Magellanic Stream (the leading arm), on the opposite side of
the Magellanic Clouds to the Stream, which mimicks the overall distribution of
several neutral hydrogen clumps observed in the corresponding region of the
sky. The elongation of the SMC bar along the line-of-sight direction suggested
by Cepheid observations has been partially reproduced, alongside its projected
appearance on the sky. The model successfully explains some major trends in the
kinematics of young populations in the SMC bar and older populations in the
`halo' of the SMC, as well as the overall velocity pattern for the gas, young
stars, and carbon stars in the inter-Cloud region.

Gravitational light deflection can distort the images of distant sources by
its tidal effects. The population of faint blue galaxies is at sufficiently
high redshift so that their images are distorted near foreground clusters, with
giant luminous arcs being the most spectacular evidence for this effect. Much
weaker distortions, however, can observationally be detected by a statistical
analysis of the numerous faint galaxy images, as first demonstrated by Tyson,
Valdes \& Wenk. This distortion effect can be used as a {\it quantitativetool}
for the reconstruction of the surface mass density of galaxy clusters with
appropriate redshifts, as was demonstrated by Kaiser \&Squires. They have
derived an explicit equation for this surface mass density in terms of its
tidal field. The reconstruction formula by Kaiser \& Squires must be modified
because of two effects: in its original form it applies only to weak lenses,
and hence must be generalized to account for stronger lensing effects. Second,
due to the nature of the inversion formula, it produces boundary artefacts (or
biases) if applied to real data which are confined to a finite field on the
sky. We discuss several possibilities to obtain inversion formulae which are
exact for ideal data on a finite data field (CCD). We demonstrate that there
exists an infinite number of such finite-field inversion formulae, which differ
in their sensitivity to observational effects (such as noise, intrinsic
ellipticities of the sources, etc.). We show that, using two simple conditions,
one can uniquely specify a finite-field formula which in a well-defined sense
minimizes the sensitivity to observational effects. We then use synthetic data
to compare the quality of our new reconstruction method with that of previous

Deep CCD photometry down to V=24.5 is presented for the old Magellanic
Globular cluster NGC 2257. The main result cna be summarized as follows: i) the
RGB Bump has been detected at V=18.7+-0.1, and is compatible with determination
of this feature in GGCs; ii) NGC 2257 seems to be 2-3 Gyrs younger than a
typical GGC; iii) the helium abundance has been estimated to be Y=0.21+-0.03,
using the R- method as calibrated by Buzzoni et al., 1983.

We present Fourier analysis at 490\,nm for 87 Cepheid light curves in the bar
of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The photometry has be obtained through the EROS
project whose main purpose is the search for baryonic dark matter in the
Galactic halo. The very high quality of the photometry and the good phase
coverage enable us to obtain accurate Fourier decomposition of the ligh curves.
As a consequence we confirm that the so-called s-Cepheids are overtone
pulsators and represent about 30 $\%$ of our sample, whereas the Classical
Cepheids are fundamental pulsators. We have identified a number of features in
plots of amplitude ratios and phase differences versus period. These features
are usually related to resonances between different pulsation modes. If we
accept that Fourier decomposition techniques applied to light curves yield
positions for the centres of resonances, then it seems that resonances occur in
LMC Cepheids at the same period as in Galactic Cepheids for fundamental
pulsators, whereas they appear to be at shorter periods for overtone pulsators.

Seismological observations with the Whole Earth Telescope (WET) allow the
determination of the subsurface compositional structure of white dwarf stars.
The hot DO PG 1159 has a helium surface layer with a mass of 0.001 Msun, while
the cooler DB white dwarf GD 358 has a much thinner surface helium layer of
10^-6 Msun. These results imply that either there is no evolutionary relation
between these two stars, or that there is an unknown mass loss mechanism. To
investigate possible evolutionary links between these objects, we computed
evolutionary sequences of white dwarf models including time-dependent
diffusion. Our initial model is based on the PG~1159 pulsational data, and has
a surface composition of 30% helium, 35% carbon, and 35% oxygen. Below this is
a thin transition zone where the helium fraction falls to zero. As expected,
diffusion caused a separation of the elements; a thickening surface layer of
nearly pure helium overlays a deepening transition zone where the composition
returns to the original surface composition. When the model reached the
temperature range of GD~358 and the pulsating DB white dwarfs, this pure helium
surface layer was 3x10^-6 stellar masses deep. The resulting evolved model is
very similar to the model used by Bradley and Winget (1994) to match the
pulsation observations of GD 358. The pulsation periods of this model also show
a good fit to the WET observations. These results demonstrate the plausibility
of a direct evolutionary path from PG 1159 stars to the much cooler DB white
dwarfs by inclusion of time-dependent diffusion. A problem still remains in
that our models have no hydrogen, and thus must retain their DB nature while
their surface tempeture drops from 45,000K to 30,000K. Since there are no known
DB stars in this range, we plan to address this problem in future calculations.

The excess numbers of blue galaxies at faint magnitudes are a long-standing
cosmological puzzle. We present new number-magnitude counts as a function of
galactic morphology from the first deep fields of the Cycle 4 Hubble Space
Telescope {\it Medium Deep Survey} project. From a sample of 301 galaxies we
define counts for elliptical, spiral and irregular/peculiar galaxies to $I=22$.
We find two principal results. Firstly the elliptical and spiral galaxy counts
both follow the predictions of high-normalisation no-evolution models at all
magnitudes, indicating that regular Hubble types evolve only slowly to $z\sim
0.5$. Secondly we find that irregular/peculiar galaxies, including
multiple-peaked, possibly merging, objects, have a very steep number-magnitude
relation and greatly exceed predictions based on proportions in local surveys.
These systems make up half the total counts by $I=22$ and imply the
rapidly-evolving component of the faint galaxy population has been identified.

We determine the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies in the core of the Coma
cluster for M_R<=-11.4 (assuming H_0=75 km/s/Mpc), a magnitude regime
previously explored only in the Local Group. Objects are counted in a deep CCD
image of Coma having RMS noise of 27.7 R mag~arcsec$^{-2}$. A correction for
objects in the foreground or background of the Coma cluster---and the
uncertainty in this correction---are determined from images of five other
high-latitude fields, carefully matched to the Coma image in both resolution
and noise level. Accurate counts of Coma cluster members are obtained as faint
as R=25.5, or M_R=-9.4. The LF for galaxies is well fit by a power law
dN/dL\propto L^\alpha, with \alpha=-1.42\pm0.05, over the range
-19.4<M_R<-11.4; faintward of this range, the galaxies are unresolved and
indistinguishable from globular clusters, but the data are consistent with an
extrapolation of the power law. Surface brightness biases are minimized since
galaxies are not subjected to morphological selection, and the limiting
detection isophote is 27.6 R mag~arcsec$^{-2}$. We find the typical
$M_R\approx-12$ Coma cluster galaxy to have an exponential scale length
$\approx200$~pc, similar to Local Group galaxies of comparable magnitude. These
extreme dwarf galaxies show a surface density increasing towards the giant
elliptical NGC~4874 as $r^{-1.3}$, similar to the diffuse light and globular
cluster distributions. The luminosity in the detected dwarf galaxies is at most
a few percent of the total diffuse light of the giant galaxies in the cluster,
and the contribution of the dwarfs to the mass of the cluster is likely
negligible as well.

We have developed a numerical code to study the deformation ($\varepsilon =
(I_{zz}-I_{xx})/I_{zz}$, where $I_{ii}$ are the moments of inertia) of neutron
stars in rapidly rotation in a fully general relativistic calculation. We have
found that the deformation is larger, depending on the angular velocity, than
is generally assumed for gravitational wave estimations. Calculations were
performed by employing the Bethe-Johnson I EOS (equation of state) and a new
set of models by the Frankfurt group including $\Lambda$ hyperons for several
choices of their coupling constants to ordinary nucleons. Possible implications
for gravitational wave searches are briefly discussed.

We describe a technique for solving the combined collisionless Boltzmann and
Poisson equations in a discretised, or lattice, phase space. The time and the
positions and velocities of `particles' take on integer values, and the forces
are rounded to the nearest integer. The equations of motion are symplectic. In
the limit of high resolution, the lattice equations become the usual
integro-differential equations of stellar dynamics. The technique complements
other tools for solving those equations approximately, such as $N$-body
simulation, or techniques based on phase-space grids. Equilibria are found in a
variety of shapes and sizes. They are true equilibria in the sense that they do
not evolve with time, even slowly, unlike existing $N$-body approximations to
stellar systems, which are subject to two-body relaxation. They can also be
`tailor-made' in the sense that the mass distribution is constrained to be
close to some pre-specified function. Their principal limitation is the amount
of memory required to store the lattice, which in practice restricts the
technique to modeling systems with a high degree of symmetry. We also develop a
method for analysing the linear stability of collisionless systems, based on
lattice equilibria as an unperturbed model.

We study a cosmological scenario for gamma ray bursts (GRBs) where
relativistic flows interact with dense radiation fields. It is shown that this
scenario is plausible in very dense stellar regions which are known to exist in
collapsed cores of globular clusters or dense nuclei of galaxies. It yields a
correct quantitative description of the temporal behavior of GRBs. Several
other properties of GRBs are easily explained.

Following the report of solar-like oscillations in the G0 V star eta Boo
(Kjeldsen et al. 1995, AJ 109, 1313), a first attempt to model the observed
frequencies was made by Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (1995, ApJ Letters, in
press). This attempt succeeded in reproducing the observed frequency
separations, although there remained a difference of about 10 microHz between
observed and computed frequencies. In those models, the near-surface region of
the star was treated rather crudely. Here we consider more sophisticated models
that include non-local mixing-length theory, turbulent pressure and
nonadiabatic oscillations.

We present the analysis of pointed ROSAT PSPC observations of five of the
most luminous, intermediate redshift ($0.1 < z < 0.15$) clusters of galaxies
detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The PSPC data are combined with optical
CCD images and spectra to examine the relationship between clusters and their
central cluster galaxies (CCGs). Abell 1068, Abell 1361 and Abell 1664 contain
three of the most optically line-luminous CCGs known. The PSPC X-ray data show
that these galaxies lie at the centres of massive (200 -- 400 solar masses per
year) cooling flows. The alignment between CCGs and their host clusters has
been investigated. For those clusters with cooling flows, the position angles
of the X-ray emission from the clusters and the optical emission from the CCGs
agrees within 5 degrees. For the one probable non-cooling flow cluster in the
sample, Abell 2208, the alignment is significantly poorer. We examine the
evidence for intrinsic X-ray absorption in the clusters. The X-ray spectra for
Abell 1068 and Abell 1664 show that the cooling flows in these clusters are
intrinsically absorbed by equivalent hydrogen column densities $\geq 10^{21}
atom cm$^{-2}$. The optical spectra of the CCGs in these clusters exhibit
substantial intrinsic reddening, at levels consistent with the X-ray absorption
results if standard dust to gas ratios are assumed.

It is shown that the average magnitude - redshift diagram for a
magnitude-limited sample of galaxies can be effectively used for mapping galaxy
velocity field. This new approach is quantitatively introduced and applied to
the CfA, ESO/LV and ZCAT samples of galaxies. Strong arguments are presented
for infall velocities in the Virgo and Fornax superclusters and in the Great
Wall structure.

Luminosity Functions have been obtained for very faint dwarf galaxies in the
cores of four rich clusters of galaxies (Abell 2052, 2107, 2199 and 2666). It
is found that the luminosity function of dwarf galaxies rises very steeply in
these clusters, with a power-law slope of \alpha -2.2 (down to absolute
limiting magnitudes M_I = -13 and M_B = -11 for H_0 = 75 km/s/Mpc). A
steepening of the luminosity function at faint magnitudes may in fact be a
common feature of both cluster and field populations. Such a result may explain
the observed excess counts of faint, intermediate redshift galaxies in the
Universe, without resorting to more exotic phenomena. An alternate explanation
is that star formation in dwarf galaxies is less affected by gas loss in the
richest clusters, because of the dense, hot intracluster medium found in such
environments.

I summarize the successes and failures of the most popular current
cosmological models in accounting for the available observations. This
evaluation, presented as the summary of the 11th Potsdam Workshop on
Large-Scale Structure, was discussed by all the participants. I present the
ratings given to each model based on a confrontation with the data, and the
final vote taken.

Rich clusters of galaxies, the largest virialized systems known, provide a
powerful tool for the study of cosmology. Some of the fundamental questions
that can be addressed with clusters of galaxies include: how did galaxies and
large-scale structure form and evolve? What is the amount, composition and
distribution of matter in the universe? I review some of the studies utilizing
clusters of galaxies to investigare, among others:
  - The dark matter on clusters scale and the mean mass-density of the
universe;
  - The large-scale structure of the universe;
  - The peculiar velocity field on large scales;
  - The mass-function of groups and clusters of galaxies;
  - The constraints placed on specific cosmological models using the cluster
data.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will provide a complete imaging and
spectroscopic survey of the high-latitude northern sky. The 2D survey will
image the sky in five colors and will contain nearly 5 x 107 galaxies to g ~
23m. The spectroscopic survey will obtain spectra of the brightest 106
galaxies, 105 quasars, and 103.5 rich clusters of galaxies (to g~18.3-19.3m,
respectively). I summarize some of the science opportunities that will be made
possible by this survey for studying the clustering and large-scale structure
of the universe.
  The survey will identify a complete sample of several thousand rich clusters
of galaxies, both in 2D and 3D - the largest automated sample yet available.
The extensive cluster sample can be used to determine critical clustering
properties such as the luminosity-function, velocity-function, and
mass-function of clusters of galaxies (a critical test for cosmological
models), detailed cluster dynamics and W(dyn), the cluster correlation function
and its dependence on richness, cluster evolution, superclustering and voids to
the largest scales yet observed, the motions of clusters and their large-scale
peculiar velocity field, as well as detailed correlations between x-ray and
optical properties of clusters, the density-morphology relation, and
cluster-quasar associations. The large redshift survey, reaching to a depth of
600h-1 Mpc, will accurately map the largest scales yet observed, determine the
power-spectrum and correlation function on these large scales for different
type galaxies, and study the clustering of quasars to high redshifts (z 4). The
implications of the survey for cosmological models, the dark matter, and W are
also discussed.

There is now dynamical evidence for massive dark objects at the center of
several galaxies, but suggestions that these are supermassive black holes are
based only on indirect astrophysical arguments. The recent unprecedented
measurement of the rotation curve of maser emission sources at the center of
NGC 4258, and the remarkable discovery that it is Keplerian to high precision,
provides us a unique opportunity for testing alternatives to a BH (e.g., a
massive cluster of stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, or halo dark
matter).
  We use a conservative upper limit on the systematic deviation from a
Keplerian rotation curve to constrain the mass distribution at the galaxy
center. Based on evaporation and physical collision time-scale arguments, we
show that a central cluster is ruled out, *unless* the cluster consists of
*extremely* dense objects with mass less than about 0.05 solar masses (e.g.,
low mass BHs or elementary particles). Since both of these dynamically-allowed
systems are very improbable for other astrophysical reasons, we conclude that a
central dense cluster at the center of NGC 4258 is *very* improbable, thus
leaving the alternative possibility of a massive BH. We also show that the mass
of the BH must be at least 98% of the mass enclosed within the inner edge of
the masering disk (3.6*10^7 solar masses). A substantial contribution to that
mass from a density cusp in the background mass distribution is excluded.

We present some new results from an ongoing investigation of the anisotropy
of the two--point correlation function for optically selected galaxies. We have
estimated xi(r_p,pi) from the Perseus-Pisces redshift survey, which is now
virtually 100\% complete for all morphological types to m_B = 15.5. We detect
strong distortions of the iso-correlation contours in xi(r_p,pi). These
correspond to a global (`cluster' plus `field') pairwise velocity dispersion at
1 h^{-1} Mpc, sigma(1), which is about a factor of two higher than the
canonical value \sim 350 km s^{-1} obtained from the CfA1 survey and recently
from the 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift survey. However, the variance of this value is
still rather strong even within the relatively large volumes surveyed
(typically 90$^\circ$ $\times$ 45$^\circ$ $\times$ 100 h^{-1} Mpc). From the
largest volume explorable (126 h^{-1} Mpc depth), the best bet for the `cosmic'
value of sigma(1) seems to be between 600 and 700 km s^{-1}. However, for a
hopefully robust determination of its value we will have to wait for the
analyses of the next generation of larger {\tenbf optical} redshift surveys
(such as, e.g., the now completed ESP or the forthcoming Sloan Digital Sky
Survey).

We compute the contribution to the three--point temperature correlation
function of the Cosmic Microwave Background coming from the non--linear
evolution of Gaussian initial perturbations, as described by the Rees--Sciama
(or integrated Sachs--Wolfe) effect. By expressing the collapsed three--point
function in terms of multipole amplitudes, we are able to calculate its
expectation value for any power spectrum and for any experimental setting on
large angular scales. We also give an analytical expression for the {\it rms}
collapsed three--point function arising from the cosmic variance of a Gaussian
fluctuation field. In the case of {\it COBE} DMR, we find that the predicted
signal is about three orders of magnitude below that expected from the cosmic
variance.

Using the multislit LDSS-2 spectrograph on the {\it William Herschel
Telescope} we have completed a redshift survey in the magnitude range $22.5<B<
24$ which has produced 73 redshifts representing a 73\% complete sample
uniformly-selected from four deep fields at high Galactic latitude. The survey
extends out to $z>1$ and includes the highest redshift galaxy ($z=1.108$) yet
discovered in a field sample. The median redshift, $\zmed=0.46$, and form of
the redshift distribution constitute compelling evidence against simple
luminosity evolution as an explanation of the large excess of faint galaxies
($\simeq\times$2--4 no-evolution) seen in this magnitude range. Rather we
identify the excess population as blue objects with $z\sim 0.4$ and $B$\,
luminosities similar to local $L^*$ galaxies indicating a dramatic decrease in
the density of such objects over the last Hubble time, confirming the trends
found in brighter redshift surveys. We also find a marked absence of {\it very}
low redshift galaxies ($z<$0.1) at faint limits, severely constraining any
significant steepening of the local field galaxy luminosity function at low
luminosities.

We present molecular line, H2O maser, radio continuum and near infrared maps
of the bipolar outflow source AFGL5142. The high resolution of our molecular CO
observations enables us to define the morphology of the large-scale bipolar
outflow into a two lobe structure extending for 2' on each side of the center.
In the perpendicular direction, we find consistent evidence for a second, more
compact (<0.5') outflow in the form of a spatial velocity offset in the CO map
and of an H2 jet-like structure derived from a near infrared narrow band image.
On a smaller scale size, the radio and infrared continuum observations reveal
the engines of the molecular outflows. The maser emission occurs near the
position of the most embedded source of the cluster, IRS1. This is located at
the center of the compact outflow and jets of shocked H2 and coincides with an
ultra compact radio continuum source (most probably an ionized stellar wind).
The H2O cluster is composed of five spatial components: two are within 0.3''
from the YSO (a few hundred AU) and three are at larger distance (1.5--2'', a
few thousand AU). A marginal detection of proper motion of the two more distant
masers may suggest a high expansion velocity at a distance 4000 AU from the
YSO, similar to what is found in Orion KL and W49N. The brightest NIR source of
the cluster (IRS2) is associated with an IRAS point source and lies along the
axis of the large-scale bipolar outflow. We propose that the masers and the
compact molecular outflow are powered concurrently by the wind from the YSO
associated with IRS1, while the large-scale outflow could be the remnant from
the formation of IRS2.

The issue of the observability of Old Isolated Neutron Stars (ONSs) accreting
from the interstellar gas, is reconsidered using the spectra presented in
Zampieri {\it et al.\/} (1995). In particular, we focus our attention on the
overall soft X--ray emission of ONSs, which may provide a substantial
contribution to the X--ray background in the 0.5--2 keV band. It is found that
if accretion is channeled into polar caps by a magnetic field of $\sim 10^9$ G,
up to $\sim$ $12-25 \%$ of the unresolved soft excess observed at high
latitudes in the X--ray background can be explained in terms of emission from
accreting isolated ONSs. However, this would imply the detection with ROSAT of
$\sim 10$ sources deg$^{-2}$ above a threshold of $\sim 10^{-14} \, {\rm erg\,
cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. A brief reconsideration of the observability of isolated ONSs
as individual X--ray sources is also presented.

In this letter we present calibrated mass and light profiles of the rich
cluster of galaxies Abell 1689 out to 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the center. The high
surface density of faint blue galaxies at high redshift, selected by their low
surface brightness, are unique tools for mapping the projected mass
distribution of foreground mass concentrations. The systematic gravitational
lens distortions of $10^4$ of these background galaxies in 15\arcmin\ fields
reveal detailed mass profiles for intervening clusters of galaxies, and are a
direct measure of the growth of mass inhomogeneity. The mass is measured
directly, avoiding uncertainties encountered in velocity or X-ray derived mass
estimates.
  Mass in the rich cluster Abell 1689 follows smoothed light, outside 100
h$^{-1}$ kpc, with a rest-frame V band mass-to-light ratio of $400 \pm 60$
$h^{-1} (M/L_V)_\odot$. Near the cluster center, mass appears to be more
smoothly distributed than light. Out to a radius of 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc the total
mass follows a steeper than isothermal profile. Comparing with preliminary high
resolution N-body clustering simulations for various cosmogonies on these
scales, these data are incompatible with hot dark matter, a poor fit to most
mixed dark matter models, and favor open or $\Lambda > 0$ cold dark matter.
Substructure is seen in both the mass and the light, but detailed
correspondence is erased on scales less than 100 $h^{-1}$ kpc.

Using recently calculated yields for Type II supernovae, along with models
for chemical evolution and the distribution of mass in the interstellar medium,
the current abundances and spatial distributions of two key gamma-ray
radioactivities, $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe, are determined. The estimated steady
state production rates are 2.0 $\pm$ 1.0 M\sun \ Myr$^{-1}$ for $^{26}$Al and
0.75 $\pm$ 0.4 M\sun \ Myr$^{-1}$ for $^{60}$Fe. This corresponds to 2.2 $\pm$
1.1 M\sun \ of $^{26}$Al and 1.7 $\pm$ 0.9 M\sun \ of $^{60}$Fe in the present
interstellar medium. Sources of uncertainty are discussed, one of the more
important being the current rate of core collapse supernovae in the Galaxy. Our
simple model gives three per century, but reasonable changes in the star
formation rate could easily accommodate a core collapse rate one-half as large,
and thus one-half the yields. When these stellar and chemical evolution results
are mapped into a three dimensional model of the Galaxy, the calculated 1809
keV gamma-ray flux map is consistent with the {\it Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory} observations of a steep decline in the flux outside a longitude of
$\pm$ 50$^\circ$ from the Galactic center, and the slight flux enhancements
observed in the vicinity of spiral arms. Other potential stellar sources of
$^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe are mentioned, especially the possibility of $^{60}$Fe
synthesis in Type Ia supernovae. Predictions for the $^{60}$Fe mass
distribution, total mass, and flux map are given.

In an expanding universe, velocity field and gravitational force field are
proportional to each other in the linear regime. Neither of these quantities
evolve in time and these can be scaled suitably so that the constant of
proportionality is unity and velocity and force field are equal. The Zeldovich
approximation extends this feature beyond the linear regime, until formation of
pancakes. Nonlinear clustering which takes place {\it after} the breakdown of
Zeldovich approximation, breaks this relation and the mismatch between these
two vectors increases as the evolution proceeds. We suggest that the difference
of these two vectors could form the basis for a powerful, new, statistical
indicator of nonlinear clustering. We define an indicator called velocity
contrast, study its behaviour using N-Body simulations and show that it can be
used effectively to delineate the regions where nonlinear clustering has taken
place. We discuss several features of this statistical indicator and provide
simple analytic models to understand its behaviour. Particles with velocity
contrast higher than a threshold have a correlation function which is biased
with respect to the original sample. This bias factor is scale dependent and
tends to unity at large scales.

The evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in disk galaxies is investigated
numerically. The gasdynamical simulations in a disk perturbed by spiral or bar
potential are incorporated into the kinematic calculations of induction
equations to elucidate the effects of non-axisymmetric disk structure on
magnetic fields. The effects of interstellar turbulence are given as the
turbulent diffusion of magnetic fields. The usually adopted dynamo mechanism of
alpha-effect is not considered in our computations, because it is not obvious
about the actual existence of the effect in a galaxy. Our principal concern is
to clear how observationally and theoretically well-established gas flow
affects the magnetic-field structure and evolution, without putting a lot of
artificial parameters in the model. We have found that the density-wave
streaming motion of gas has a significant influence on the distribution of
magnetic fields: the lines of force are well aligned with spiral arms due to
the compressional and additional shearing flow of gas in these regions.

I report the detection of two X-ray sources of luminosities $\sim 10^{36}
{\rm~ergs~s^{-1}}$ in the central region of 30 Doradus. These two sources
appear point-like in images taken with the {\sl ROSAT} HRI. One of the sources
is most likely associated with a close spectroscopic binary R140a2 (WN6) with
an orbital period of 2.76 days. The mass of the unknown binary component is
likely in the range of $2.4 - 15{\rm~M}_\odot$. This suggests that the X-ray
source could represent a long-sought class of binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet
star and a black hole. The other source, which coincides spatially with Mk34
(WN4.5), may have a similar nature. Available X-ray spectral data support this
Wolf-Rayet + black-hole binary explanation of the two sources. I have used a
{\sl ROSAT} PSPC observation to show that the sources have ultrasoft spectra
with possible intrinsic absorption. Modeled with multicolor blackbody disks,
the spectra provide estimates of the disks' characteristic inner radii, which
are in agreement with those obtained for the known black-hole candidates. An
{\sl ASCA} observation has further revealed a hard X-ray spectral component
from the central 30 Doradus region. This component, represented by a power law
with a photon index of $\sim 2.4$, may belong to the two sources. The
characteristics of both the power-law and ultrasoft components strongly
indicates that the two sources are black-hole candidates in high-mass X-ray
binaries.

When using a formulation of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) which
conserves momentum exactly the motion of the particles is observed to be
unstable to negative stress. It is also found that under normal circumstances a
lattice of SPH particles is potentially unstable to transverse waves. This
document is a summary of a detailed report (Morris 1994) investigating the
nature of these and other instabilities in depth. Approaches which may be used
to eliminate these instabilities are suggested. It is found that the stability
properties of SPH in general improve as higher order spline interpolants,
approximating a Gaussian, are used as kernels.

The standard light curve of a microlensing event provides only two
constraints on the six unknown parameters of the lens. We show that narrow-band
photometry during a microlensing event of a giant star can in addition
determine the angular radius of the Einstein ring and the proper motion of the
lens. This possibility results from the fact that the extended atmospheres of
giants emit the cores of resonant lines primarily from a narrow ring (limb
brightening). The radius of the emission ring can be determined to a precision
of 20% by detailed spectroscopic observations of the source after the lensing
event has ended. A considerable fraction of the clump giant stars in the bulge
have a ring radius >10^{12} cm, within the range of Einstein radii for
sub-solar mass lenses. The extended thin ring also provides a sensitive probe
of possible planetary companions as it sweeps across the lens plane. The ring
signature can be detected photometrically, using a narrow-band filter centered
on the CaII K line at 3933 A.

A simple spherically-symmetric, steady-state, cooling-flow description with
gas loss (following Sarazin \& Ashe 1989), within galaxy models constrained by
radially extended stellar dynamical data, is shown to provide generally
reasonable fits to the existing data on X-ray emission profiles and
temperatures for a set of bright elliptical galaxies in Virgo and Fornax. Three
free parameters are needed to specify the model: the external mass flux, the
external pressure, and a dimensionless factor, which regulates the mass
deposition rate along the flow. Three different assumptions on the supernova
rate have been considered. A moderate value for the supernova rate in
elliptical galaxies is found to be preferred. Confining pressures of
$p_{ext}\sim4\div15\times10^3\kelvin$ cm$^{-3}$ and significant accretion rates
of external material, up to $4\msolar/\yr$, are suggested by our models. A
possible correlation between $L_X/L_B$ and the iron abundance in the gas inside
ellipticals is pointed out.

The properties of axisymmetric accretion flows of cold adiabatic gas with
zero total energy in the vicinity of a Newtonian point mass are characterized
by a single dimensionless parameter, the thickness of incoming flow. In the
limit of thin accretion flows with vanishing thickness, we show that the
governing equations become self-similar, involving no free parameters. We study
numerically thin accretion flows with finite thickness as well as those with
vanishing thickness. Mass elements of the incoming flow enter the computational
regime as thin rings. In the case with finite thickness, after a transient
period of initial adjustment, an almost steady-state accretion shock with a
small oscillation amplitude forms, confirming the previous work by Molteni,
Lanzafame, \& Chakrabarti (1994). The gas in the region of vorticity between
the funnel wall and the accretion shock follows closed streamlines, forming a
torus. This torus, in turn, behaves as an effective barrier to the incoming
flow and supports the accretion shock which reflects the incoming gas away from
the equatorial plane. The postshock flow, which is further accelerated by the
pressure gradient behind the shock, goes through a second shock which then
reflects the flow away from the symmetry axis to form a conical outgoing wind.
As the thickness of the inflowing layer decreases (or if the ratio of the half
thickness to the distance to the funnel wall along the equatorial plan is
smaller than $\sim0.1$), the flow becomes unstable. In the case with vanishing
thickness, the accretion shock formed to stop the incoming flow behind the
funnel wall oscillates quasi-periodically with an amplitude comparable to the
thickness. The structure between the funnel wall and the accretion shock is
destroyed as the shock moves inwards toward the central mass and re-generated

We present the data from an extensive, moderately deep (b_J = 19.5)
spectroscopic survey of $\sim 600$ galaxies within four regions of sky located
near the South Galactic Pole. About 75% of the measured galaxies are in a 3deg
x 1.5deg region dominated by the rich cluster Klemola 44 (Abell 4038). The
other three smaller areas cover about 1 square degree each. Here we discuss in
detail the observing and data reduction strategies, the completeness and errors
on the measured redshifts. The data collected are being used for: (1) a study
of the large--scale redshift distribution of the galaxies in each field, and
(2) a thorough dynamical investigation of Klemola 44. Results from these
analyses will be presented in forthcoming papers.

We have re--examined the chemical composition of \lya clouds using the
composite--cloud technique, in which each \lya line in a spectrum is shifted to
its rest frame wavelength and all rest frame spectra are co--added to form an
`averaged' \lya cloud spectrum. We illustrate how various estimates of the
spectrum and redshift evolution of the background ionizing UV flux lead to very
different predictions for the relative strengths of heavy element lines in the
forest clouds. We also show how the potential abundance limits depend on the
various observational quantities and how different procedures may be required
for OVI and CIV. Preliminary results are presented from an analysis of two high
redshift QSO echelle spectra.

Wide-field optical and near--IR ($JHK$) imaging is presented for two rich
galaxy clusters: Abell~370 at $z=0.374$ and Abell~851 (Cl0939+47) at $z=0.407$.
Galaxy catalogs selected from the near--IR images are 90\% complete to
approximately 1.5 mag below $K^\ast$ resulting in samples with $\sim$100
probable member galaxies per cluster in the central $\sim$2 Mpc. Comparison
with $HST$ WFPC images yields subsamples of $\sim$70 galaxies in each cluster
with morphological types. Analysis of the complete samples and the $HST$
subsamples shows that the $z\sim 0.4$ E/S0s are bluer than those in the Bower
et al.\ (1992) Coma sample in the optical$-K$ color by $0.13$~mag for Abell~370
and by $0.18$~mag for Abell~851. If real, the bluing of the E/S0 populations at
moderate redshift is consistent with that calculated from the Bruzual and
Charlot (1993) models of passive elliptical galaxy evolution. In both clusters
the intrinsic scatter of the known E/S0s about their optical$-K$ color--mag
relation is small ($\sim 0.06$ mag) and not significantly different from that
of Coma E/S0s as given by Bower et al.\ (1992), indicating that the galaxies
within each cluster formed at the same time at an early epoch.

Observations of gravitational lensing indicate that the mass distribution in
clusters of galaxies (where most of the mass is dark matter) is highly peaked
towards the center, while X-ray observations imply that the gas is more
extended. The additional fact that the gas is cooling in the center has often
led one to expect that the gas temperature should be lower near the center, and
therefore the gas should be more concentrated than the dark matter. We show
that such expectation is not correct, and that the gas temperature must remain
approximately constant within the cooling region in order to have consistency
with the observed X-ray profiles and lenses. A multiphase cooling flow
naturally produces an approximately constant temperature profile, and a more
extended distribution for the gas compared to the mass. Cool phases are
deposited at relatively large radius, while hot phases are adiabatically heated
as they flow inwards and can keep the average temperature constant. Thus,
cooling flows result in an {\it increase} of the central temperature, relative
to a case where there is no cooling and the gas follows the mass distribution.
  The increased central temperatures caused by cooling flows give a
characteristic core radius to the gas profiles, which is of order the cooling
radius. This provides a natural explanation for the typical cores observed in
X-ray clusters. It also brings into better agreement with observations the rate
of cluster evolution expected in self-similar hierarchical models. We propose
that clusters having core radii much larger than their cooling radii are in the
process of merging and are not in dynamical equilibrium.

We investigate the aspherization of an active mirror for correcting third and
fifth-order aberrations. We use a stainless steel AISI 420 mirror with a
controlled pressure load, two series of 12-punctual radial positions of force
application distributed symmetrically in two concentric rings around the
mirror. We obtain the wavefronts for Cv1, Sph3, Coma3, Astm3, Comatri, Astm5
aswell as those of the added wavefronts. Although this active prototype mirror
has general uses, our goal is to compensate the aberrations of a liquid mirror
observing at large angles from the zenith.

The demonstration of repeated gamma-ray bursts from an individual source
would severely constrain burst source models. Recent reports (Quashnock and
Lamb 1993; Wang and Lingenfelter 1993) of evidence for repetition in the first
BATSE burst catalog have generated renewed interest in this issue. Here, we
analyze the angular distribution of 585 bursts of the second BATSE catalog
(Meegan et al. 1994). We search for evidence of burst recurrence using the
nearest and farthest neighbor statistic and the two-point angular correlation
function. We find the data to be consistent with the hypothesis that burst
sources do not repeat; however, a repeater fraction of up to about 20% of the
observed bursts cannot be excluded.

The presence of dust in elliptical galaxies has recently been shown to be
quite common. Deep optical multi-colour CCD imaging has revealed the presence
of dust lanes and patches, and the technique of co-adding IRAS survey scans has
led to many detections of elliptical galaxies. The optical and far-infrared
surveys reported similar detection rates of dust, which may indicate that dust
in elliptical galaxies is generally distributed in the optically detected lanes
or patches. However, we show here that the amount of dust as derived from the
optical extinction values is typically an order of magnitude smaller than that
derived from the IRAS flux densities, in strong contrast with the situation in
spiral galaxies.
  To unriddle this dilemma, we postulate that the majority of the dust in
elliptical galaxies exists as a diffusely distributed component which is
undetectable using optical methods. Employing a multiple scattering model for
the dust, we show that the presence of this newly postulated dust component
implies significant radial colour gradients which were essentially thought to
arise from stellar population gradients only.
  The energetics of the diffusely distributed dust component is shown to be
consistent with the IRAS data. A comparison of the detectable amount of dust in
elliptical galaxies embedded in hot, X-ray-emitting gas with the amount
expected in case the production and destruction rates of dust are equal
indicates that most of the dust in elliptical galaxies has been accreted from
other galaxies.

Two main features of the observable distribution of visible matter are the
space correlations of galaxy positions and the mass function of galaxies. As
discussed in Pietronero and Sylos Labini on this issue ([1], see also [2],[3]),
the concept of multifractal (MF) distribution (including the masses) naturally
unifies these two properties. Hence with the knowledge of the whole MF spectrum
one obtains information on the correlations in space as well as on the mass
function.
  From a theoretical point of view one would like to identify the dynamical
process that leads to such a MF distribution. In order to gain some insight
into this complex problem we have developed a simple stochastic model that
includes some of the basic properties of aggregation process and allows us to
pose a variety of interesting question concerning the possible dynamical origin
of the MF distribution. The dynamics is characterised by some parameters, that
have a direct physical meaning in term of cosmological processes. In this way
we can relate the input parameters of the dynamics to the properties of the
final configuration and produce a sort of phase diagram.

The basic hypothesis of a post-Copernican Cosmological theory is that {\em
all the points} of the Universe have to be essentially equivalent: this
hypothesis is required in order to avoid any privileged {\em observer}. This
assumption has been implemented by Einstein in the so-called Cosmological
Principles (CP): {\em all the positions} in the Universe have to be essentially
equivalent, so that the Universe is homogeneous. This situation implies also
the condition of spherical symmetry about every point, so that the Universe in
also Isotropic. There is a hidden assumption in the formulation of the CP in
regard to the hypothesis that all the points are equivalent In fact, the
condition that all the occupied points are statistically equivalent with
respect to their environment correspond to the property of of Local Isotropy.
It is generally believed that the Universe cannot be isotropic about every
point without being also homogeneous [1]. Actually Local Isotropy does not
necessarily implies homogeneity; in fact a topology theorem states that
homogeneity is implied by the condition of local isotropy together with {\em
the assumption of the analyticity or regularity} for the distribution of
matter. Up to the seventies analyticity was an obvious implicit assumption in
any physical problem. Recently however we have learned about intrinsically
irregular structures for which analyticity should be considered as a property
to be tested with appropriate analysis of experiment.

It is greatly expected that the relic neutrino background from past
supernovae is detected by Superkamiokande (SK) which is now under construction.
We calculate the spectrum and the event rate at SK systematically by using the
results of simulations of a supernova explosion and reasonable supernova rates.
We also investigate the effect of a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, on the
spectrum, since some recent cosmological observations strongly suggest the
existence of $\Lambda$. We find following results. 1) The spectrum has a peak
at about 3 MeV, which is much lower than that of previous estimate ($6 \sim$ 10
MeV). 2) The event rate at SK in the range from 10 MeV to 50 MeV, where the
relic neutrinos from past supernovae is dominant, is about $25 \, {h_{50}}^2 \,
\left( \frac{R_{SN}}{0.1 {\rm yr^{-1}}} \right) \left(\frac{n_G \,
h_{50}^{-3}}{0.02{\rm Mpc}^{-3}}\right)$ events per year, where $R_{SN}$ is the
supernova rate in a galaxy, $n_G$ is the number density of galaxies, and
$h_{50} = H_0 /$ (50km/s/Mpc), where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. 3) The event
rate is almost insensitive to $\Lambda$. The flux increases in the low energy
side ($< 10$ MeV) with increasing $\Lambda$, but decreases in the high energy
side (10 MeV $<$) in models in which the integrated number of supernovae in one
galaxy is fixed.

Starting from the observed redshift distribution of a volume limited
Abell/ACO cluster sample we use a 2-step procedure to recover their distances
and peculiar velocities (assuming linear theory and linear biasing). The
resulting 3D dipole is found to be 23\% less than the corresponding z-space one
which leads to a value of $\beta \approx 0.21$ consistent with an
$\Omega_{\circ}=1$ Universe. The cluster velocity field is dominated by a
large-scale streaming motion towards the Shapley concentration and the
resulting bulk velocity agrees extremely well with that deduced by POTENT, on
smaller scales. Our results are in strong disagreement with those of Lauer \&
Postman.

We present the results of our study on three close pairs of QSOs. Our results
are consistent with the existence of a proximity effect due to the foreground
QSO, but due to its weakness we can only reject the absence of such effect at
approx. 1 sigma level. By modelling this proximity effect in terms of a simple
photoionisation model, we find the best value for the UV ionizing background to
be approx. 10**(-20.5) erg cm**(-2) s**(-1) Hz**(-1) srad**(-1) at the Lyman
limit, and an absolute lower limit (95\% confidence) of 10**(-21.8) in the same
units. This lower limit rejects a number of models for the UV background where
it is mostly contributed by QSOs and absorption by Lyman limit systems is taken
into account.

The passage of stars through the beam of a lensed quasar can induce violent
fluctuations in its apparent brightness. The fluctuations observed in the
Huchra lens, (2237+0305), are taken to be the first evidence of this
``microlensing'' occurring in lensing systems. Subsequent microlensing events
observed in this system and in other gravitational lenses illustrate that
microlensing should be a common phenomenon in lensed quasars. The statistical
properties of the component light curves will be defined to a large extent by
the mass distribution of the microlensing objects and the internal light
distribution of the lensed quasar. We present statistics of a large sample of
hypothetical microlensing light curves, for a number of lensing situations,
generated using an efficient numerical technique. These artificial light curves
show that the amplification probability distributions are independent of the
mass function of the compact lensing objects. The amplification probability
distributions for the Huchra lens system are presented.

In a recent paper, Li and Melrose have claimed that the splitting - due to
relativistic effects - of the Alfven surface in an axisymmetric pulsar wind
does not occur. Here we refute this claim by showing that, unless the solution
that describes the flow along each open magnetic field line passes through the
pure Alfvenic point (which is one of the manifestations of the splitting of the
Alfvenic point), it would not be physically viable both at the surface of the
star and at infinity.

We use high resolution simulations to study the formation and distribution of
galaxies within a cluster which forms hierarchically. We follow both dark
matter and baryonic gas which is subject to thermal pressure, shocks and
radiative cooling. Galaxy formation is identified with the dissipative collapse
of the gas into cold, compact knots. We examine two extreme representations of
galaxies during subsequent cluster evolution --- one purely gaseous and the
other purely stellar. The results are quite sensitive to this choice.
Gas-galaxies merge efficiently with a dominant central object while
star-galaxies merge less frequently. Thus, simulations in which galaxies remain
gaseous appear to suffer an ``overmerging'' problem, but this problem is much
less severe if the gas is allowed to turn into stars. We compare the kinematics
of the galaxy population in these two representations to that of dark halos and
of the underlying dark matter distribution. Galaxies in the stellar
representation are positively biased (\ie over-represented in the cluster) both
by number and by mass fraction. Both representations predict the galaxies to be
more centrally concentrated than the dark matter, whereas the dark halo
population is more extended. A modest velocity bias also exists in both
representations, with the largest effect, $\sigma_{gal}/\sigma_{DM} \simeq
0.7$, found for the more massive star-galaxies. Phase diagrams show that the
galaxy population has a substantial net inflow in the gas representation, while
in the stellar case it is roughly in hydrostatic equilibrium. Virial mass
estimators can underestimate the true cluster mass by up to a factor of 5. The
discrepancy is largest if only the most massive galaxies are used, reflecting
significant mass segregation.

We present the first moderate resolution (approx. 40--120 km/s) spectroscopic
observations of the bright (V<16.7) high-redshift QSOs Q1107+487 (z_{em} =
2.965) and Q1442+295 (z_{em} = 2.669) (Sanduleak & Pesch 1989). The relatively
high signal to noise reached in the spectra along with an extensive wavelength
coverage of the Lyman alpha and the Lyman beta forest allowed us to obtain,
through profile fitting, column densities and Doppler parameters of the Lyman
clouds towards these QSOs. The spectral coverage of regions longward of the
Lyman alpha emission line of the QSOs at the expected wavelengths of CIV
1548,1550 at the redshifts of the Lyman alpha forest allowed us to identify
some heavy element absorption systems (hereafter HEASs) towards these QSOs. We
have found no Lyman absorption system or HEAS towards these QSOs for which our
data allow a deuterium measurement or to provide an interesting upper limit for
the D/H ratio. The reason for this is that the Lyman lines with high column
density detected towards these QSOs belong to absorption systems showing
velocity structure.

In a previous paper we presented a typical set of galactic rotation curves
associated with the linear gravitational potential of the conformal invariant
fourth order theory of gravity which has recently been advanced by Mannheim and
Kazanas as a candidate alternative to the standard second order Newton-Einstein
theory. Reasonable agreement with data was obtained for four representative
galaxies without the need for any non-luminous or dark matter. In this paper we
present the associated formalism and compare and contrast the linear potential
explanation of the general systematics of galactic rotation curves and the
associated Tully-Fisher relation with that of the standard dark matter theory.
Additionally, we show that the conformal gravity picture appears to have
survived the recent round of microlensing observations unscathed. Finally, we
make a first application of the conformal theory to the larger distance scale
associated with a cluster of galaxies, with the theory being found to give a
reasonable value for the mean velocity of the virialized core of the typical
Coma cluster, again without the need to invoke dark matter.

The results of calculations of gas emission spectra with both central and
extended sources of ionization have been compared to the ratio of line
intensities observed in the extended narrow line region of NGC1068. The origin
of an extended structure of anomalous strength in the $[OIII] \lambda 5007$ and
$[NeV] \lambda 3425$ lines found by Evans & Dopita (1986) and Bergeron et al.
(1989) could be due to an additional stellar source of gas ionization located
at a distance 1-2 kpc from the nucleus.

We present a fully sampled map of the inner 3.2 kpc of the nearby spiral
galaxy NGC 2403 in the CO J=1-0 line. These data emphasize the relatively small
contribution of molecular hydrogen to the cold gas content of this galaxy, and
confirm that the gas surface densities in the inner 2.8 kpc of NGC 2403 lie
below the critical surface density for star formation under the theory proposed
by Kennicutt (1989). Since star formation is occurring throughout the inner
disk, the simple dynamical model used by Kennicutt cannot be the only important
process regulating star formation in galaxies. We suggest that stochastic star
formation processes are responsible for the star formation seen in these
regions, and thus that supercritical gas densities may not be a necessary
condition for star formation in the inner regions of galactic disks.

We present a simple and efficient, yet reasonably accurate, equation of
state, which at the moderately low temperatures and high densities found in the
interiors of stars less massive than the Sun is substantially more accurate
than its predecessor by Eggleton, Faulkner & Flannery. Along with the most
recently available values in tabular form of opacities, neutrino loss rates,
and nuclear reaction rates for a selection of the most important reactions,
this provides a convenient package of input physics for stellar modelling. We
briefly discuss a few results obtained with the updated stellar evolution code.

The \HOmega\ diagram is resurrected to dramatically illustrate the nature of
the key problems in physical cosmology today and the role that nuclear physics
plays in many of them. In particular it is noted that the constraints on
\OmegaB\ from big bang nucleosynthesis do not overlap with the constraints on
\OmegaVis\ nor have significant overlap with the lower bound on $\Omega$ from
cluster studies. The former implies that the bulk of the baryons are dark and
the later is the principle argument for non-baryonic dark matter. A comparison
with hot x-ray emitting gas in clusters is also made. The lower bound on the
age of the universe from globular cluster ages (hydrogen burning in low mass
stars) and from nucleocosmochronology also illustrates the Hubble constant
requirement $H_0 \le 66 \Hunits$ for $\Omega_0 = 1$\@. It is also noted that
high values of $H_0$ ($\sim 80\Hunits$) even more strongly require the presence
of non-baryonic dark matter. The lower limit on $H_0$ ($\ge 38\Hunits$) from
carbon detonation driven type~Ia supernova constrains long ages and only
marginally allows \OmegaB\ to overlap with \OmegaClus. Diagrams of \HOmega\ for
$\Lambda_0=0$ and $\Lambda_0\neq 0$ are presented to show that the need for
non-baryonic dark matter is independent of $\Lambda$.

A general model of magnetically controlled accretion onto T Tauri stars is
presented. In this model the magnetic field is oriented arbitrarily in relation
to the star's rotation axis. The resultant interplay between the magnetic field
and accretion disc causes a variable accretion rate. The dominant timescale of
this variability is the beat frequency between the stellar rotation frequency
and the orbital frequency at the magnetosphere boundary. This model is
analogous to that developed to explain quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass
X-ray binaries.

Recently, there has been growing interest on primordial ``blue" ($n>1$)
perturbation spectra, motivated both by a composite set of observational data
on large scales and from the point of view of theoretical model building. After
reviewing the theoretical (inflationary) motivations for these blue spectra, we
consider various observational constraints, within both Cold Dark Matter and
Mixed Dark Matter scenarios. In particular, using linear theory, we discuss
large--scale bulk flows and the X--ray cluster abundance. We also perform
various N--body simulations of these models to study the clustering properties
of the matter distribution and the peculiar velocity field.

We generalize the maximum likelihood method to non-Gaussian distribution
functions by means of the multivariate Edgeworth expansion. We stress the
potential interest of this technique in all those cosmological problems in
which the determination of a non-Gaussian signature is relevant, e.g. in the
analysis of large scale structure and cosmic microwave background. A first
important result is that the asymptotic confidence limits on the parameters are
systematically widened when the higher order correlation functions are
positive, with respect to the Gaussian case.

We present the results of a search for diffuse x-ray sources in a 65 ksec
ROSAT PSPC exposure of 47 Tuc. There is faint, soft emission on the NE side of
the cluster at a distance of 6 arcmin from the core. The location of this
emission along the direction of proper motion of the cluster suggests that it
might be due to a bow shock. We show that a simple shock model fits the
observed luminosity and temperature. However, a bow shock can only form if the
rotation of the halo gas at the height of 47 Tuc (z = 3.3 kpc) is small
compared to the rotation of the galactic plane. Therefore this observation
provides not only the first x-ray detection of hot gas in a globular cluster,
but also constrains the dynamics of the halo gas. We also find two sources of
diffuse x-ray emission to the NE of the cluster which are brighter and harder.
We consider a variety of models for this emission, including thermal emission
from a high velocity wind from a hot white dwarf, and propose that it is due to
inverse Compton emission from acceleration in the bow shock of low energy
cosmic ray electrons from the population of millisecond pulsars in the cluster.

Abundance histories for QSO absorption line systems as a function of redshift
are presented for all metals lighter than gallium. Coupling various
conventional cosmological models with a simple, first--order model for the
chemical evolution of the QSO absorption line systems allows transformation of
the observed abundance trends in the Galaxy to abundance histories for the gas
in QSO absorption line systems. Comparison of the transformed abundance
patterns with the zinc to hydrogen [Zn/H] and silicon to hydrogen [Si/H] ratios
observed in damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems finds agreement over more than two
orders of magnitude in abundance with a $\Lambda$=0, \ $\Omega$=0.2 -- 1.0, \
and $\tau_{\rm {delay}}$=3 Gyr cosmology, where $\tau_{\rm {delay}}$ is the
time between the start of the Big Bang and the beginning of galaxy formation.
Alternative meanings for the required time delay are explored, along with
extensions to the simple first--order model. Predictions are made for the
abundance histories of elements not yet observed in QSO absorption line
systems.

We present models of the extragalactic background light (EBL) based on
several scenarios of galaxy formation and evolution. We have treated galaxy
formation with the Press-Schecter approximation for both cold dark matter (CDM)
and cold+hot dark matter (CHDM) models, representing a moderate ($z_f \sim 3$)
and a late ($z_f \sim 1$) era of galaxy formation respectively. Galaxy
evolution has been treated by considering a variety of stellar types, different
initial mass functions and star formation histories, and with an accounting of
dust absorption and emission. We find that the dominant factor influencing the
EBL is the epoch of galaxy formation. A recently proposed method for observing
the EBL utilizing the absorption of $\sim 0.1$ to 10 TeV gamma-rays from active
galactic nuclei (AGN) is shown to be capable of discriminating between
different galaxy formation epochs. The one AGN viewed in TeV light, Mrk 421,
does show some evidence for a cutoff above 3 TeV; based on the EBL models
presented here, we suggest that this is due to extinction in the source. The
large absorption predicted at energies $>200$ GeV for sources at $z>0.5$
indicates that observations of TeV gamma-ray bursts (GRB) would constrain or
eliminate models in which the GRB sources lie at cosmological distances.

In this paper, we derive a physical argument for the existence of
Period-luminosity and period-luminosity-colour relations at maximum light. We
examine in detail a sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and
compare the variance of some PL and PLC type distance indicators based on mean
and maximum light. We show that a PLC relation based on maximum light leads to
a distance estimator with a dispersion about $10 \%$ smaller than its
counterpart using mean light. We also show that a PLC type relation constructed
using observations at both maximum and mean light has a significantly $( > 50
\%)$ smaller dispersion than a PLC relation using either maximum or mean light
alone. A comparable $( > 30 \%)$ reduction in the dispersion of the
corresponding distance estimator, however, in this case requires the relation
be applied to a large $( n > 30)$ group of equidistant Cepheids in, e.g., a
distant galaxy. Recent HST observations of IC4182, M81 and M100 already provide
suitable candidate data sets for this relation.

CCD photometry in the V band is presented for 7 field RR Lyrae stars selected
from a sample of eight variables which, according to data collected in the
literature, are expected to be {\it ab}-type pulsators, to have short periods
and hence high metallicity, and to be located at high {\it z} from the galactic
plane. New periods and epochs are derived for them. The new periods are only
slightly shorter than the values published on the last edition of the General
Catalog of Variable Stars (GCVS4). Instead, in six cases our amplitude of the
light variation is significantly smaller than that published on the GCVS4, and
in at least three cases the actual pulsation appears to be in the first
harmonic rather than in the fundamental mode. All the suggested {\it c}-type
pulsators show variations in the amplitude and/or quite scattered light curves.
Possible explanations are given. From a spectro-photometric analysis of the
sample, only DL Com is confirmed to pulsate in the fundamental mode, to have
short period, and to be located at relatively high {\it z}. A single object
cannot be taken as evidence for a significant metal rich population at large
distance from the galactic plane.

The new, simple method is proposed for testing the Hubble law using redshifts
and magnitude from magnitude-limited sample of galaxies. The power law relation
between redshift and distance have been assumed (cz=r^p). The obtained results:
p=1.21 \pm 0.04 (for CfA) and p=0.95 \pm 0.04 (for ESO/LV) confirm linear,
Hubble expansion. The proposed test does not take into account inhomogeneites
in space distribution of galaxies.

The origin of the highly eccentric, inclined, and resonance-locked orbit of
Pluto has long been a puzzle. A possible explanation has been proposed recently
[Malhotra, R., {\it Nature} 365:819-21 (1993)] which suggests that these
extraordinary orbital properties may be a natural consequence of the formation
and early dynamical evolution of the outer Solar system. A resonance capture
mechanism is possible during the clearing of the residual planetesimal debris
and the formation of the Oort Cloud of comets by planetesimal mass loss from
the vicinity of the giant planets. If this mechanism were in operation during
the early history of the planetary system, the entire region between the orbit
of Neptune and approximately 50 AU would have been swept by first order mean
motion resonances. Thus, resonance capture could occur not only for Pluto, but
quite generally for other trans-Neptunian small bodies. Some consequences of
this evolution for the present-day dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian
region are: (i) most of the objects in the region beyond Neptune and up to
$\sim\!50$ AU exist in very narrow zones located at orbital resonances with
Neptune (particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1 resonances), and (ii) these resonant
objects would have significantly large eccentricities. The distribution of
objects in the Kuiper Belt as predicted by this theory is presented here.

A wavelet space-scale decomposition (SSD) analysis of large scale structures
in the universe has been developed. The SSD method of identifying and measuring
structures in the spatial distribution of objects has been demonstrated. The
position and strength (richness) of the identified clusters can be described by
the corresponding coefficient of the wavelet transform. Using this technique,
we systematically detected the clustering and its evolution of QSO's Ly$\alpha$
forest lines in real data and simulated samples. We showed that the clusters of
Ly$\alpha$ absorbers do exist on scales as large as at least 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc at
significance levels of 2-4 $\sigma$. Independent data sets show about the same
strength distribution of the decomposed clusters. The number densities of the
clusters on scales of 10 - 20 h$^{-1}$ Mpc are found to evolve in an opposite
sense as that of the lines themselves, i.e. they decrease with redshift. We
also showed that the number density and the strength distribution of clusters
can play an important role in testing or discriminating models, i.e. it can
distinguish real data and simulated samples, which cannot be discriminated by
traditional ways. We used Daubechies 4 and Mallat wavelets as the bases of the
SSD. All above-mentioned conclusions do not depend on either wavelet basis.

A mass model of the rich cluster A2218 is presented based on optical and new
near-infrared images of arc(let)s and the ROSAT/HRI X-ray map. A lensing model
is proposed with two dark matter clumps, centered on the two bright galaxies
around which the various arcs are observed. Two of them, close to the most
massive clump around the brightest galaxy, are required to be fold images,
given their position angle with respect to the major axis. A third image for
each of the two arcs is then predicted to be on the opposite side of the major
axis. Both images are indeed found at the expected positions, with consistent
magnitudes, colors and shapes. One of the arcs has a known redshift of $0.7$,
and the model predicts that the other arc should be at higher redshift, $z
\approx 3$. Photometric data in UBrzJK' indicates that a redshift close to 3 is
indeed probable for this arc. The dark matter halo is found to be sharply
peaked on the giant central galaxy. The ROSAT/HRI X-ray map shows a strongly
clumped image, poorly correlated with the cD light and the mass model on scales
below $\sim$ 200$h_{50}^{-1}$kpc, but similar to the distribution of galaxies
and the mass model when smoothed on this scale. The large degree of central
substructure implied helps to account for the discrepancy previously found (in
the two massive clusters A2218 \& A1689) between the mass derived from the
gravitational lenses and that derived from the X-ray profile and temperature
distributions, in a model of hydrostatic equilibrium. Most of the discrepancy
can probably be explained by bulk motions and acceleration of the gas, and
projection effects enhancing the lensing power of the cluster.

The stellar content of the Im galaxy NGC 2366 is discussed on the basis of
CCD BVR photometry. The three brightest blue and red stars have been used to
estimate its distance, obtaining a balue of 2.9 Mpc. The spatial distribution
of the young stellar population is discussed in the light of the integrated
color indices and the color-magnitude diagrams of different zones of the
galaxy. A generalized star formation burst seems to have taken place about 50
Myr ago. The youngest stars are preferentially formed in the South-West part of
the bar, where the giant HII complex NGC 2363 is located, being younger and
bluer. The bar seems to play a role favouring star formation in one of its
extremes. Self-propagation however, does not seem to be triggering star
formation at large scale. A small region, populated by very young stars has
also been found at the East of the galaxy.

We have developed a code which links scalar-mode fluctuations in the early
universe with those observable at the present time by integrating the coupled,
linearized, Einstein, Boltzmann, and fluid equations in a perturbed flat
Robertson-Walker spacetime. The results are useful both for calculations of the
cosmic microwave background anisotropy and the linear power spectrum of matter
fluctuations. This paper introduces the serial and parallel codes, presents
timing results, and gives sample output in graphical and animated form.

Recent observations indicate that dark matter haloes have flat central
density profiles. Cosmological simulations with non-baryonic dark matter
predict however self similar haloes with central density cusps. This
contradiction has lead to the conclusion that dark matter must be baryonic.
Here it is shown that the dark matter haloes of dwarf spiral galaxies represent
a one parameter family with self similar density profiles. The observed global
halo parameters are coupled with each other through simple scaling relations
which can be explained by the standard cold dark matter model if one assumes
that all the haloes formed from density fluctuations with the same primordial
amplitude. We find that the finite central halo densities correlate with the
other global parameters. This result rules out scenarios where the flat halo
cores formed subsequently through violent dynamical processes in the baryonic
component. These cores instead provide important information on the origin and
nature of dark matter in dwarf galaxies.

We propose an analytic method for predicting the large angle CMBR temperature
fluctuations induced by model textures. The model makes use of only a small
number of phenomenological parameters which ought to be measured from simple
simulations. We derive semi-analytically the $C^l$-spectrum for $2\leq l\leq
30$ together with its associated non-Gaussian cosmic variance error bars. A
slightly tilted spectrum with an extra suppression at low $l$ is found, and we
investigate the dependence of the tilt on the parameters of the model. We also
produce a prediction for the two point correlation function. We find a high
level of cosmic confusion between texture scenarios and standard inflationary
theories in any of these quantities. However, we discover that a distinctive
non-Gaussian signal ought to be expected at low $l$, reflecting the prominent
effect of the last texture in these multipoles.

We investigate the stability to nonaxisymmetric perturbations of an accretion
disc in which a poloidal magnetic field provides part of the radial support
against gravity. Interchange instability due to radial gradients in the
magnetic field are strongly stabilized by the shear flow in the disc. For
smooth field distributions this instability is restricted to discs in which the
magnetic energy is comparable to the gravitational energy. An incompressible
model for the instability akin to the Boussinesq approximation for convection
is given which predicts the behaviour of the instability accurately. Global
axisymmetric disturbances are also considered and found to be stable for a
certain class of models. The results indicate that accretion discs may be able
to support poloidal fields which are strong enough to suppress other forms of
magnetic instability. These strong and stable field distributions are likely to
be well suited for the magnetic acceleration of jets and winds.

From spectrophotometric and chemical evolutionary modelling of interacting
and merging galaxies we predict abundances of burst stars and of globular
clusters (GCs) that may be formed in strong bursts. Observations of young GCs
in merger remnants confirm the predicted metallicities. We investigate their
formation as a result of a strong star burst with a high star formation
efficiency over a large volume of the merger remnant. The evolution of GCs of
various metallicities in terms of broad band colours and stellar metal indices
are modeled. Comparing our results to the V-I, Mgb and Fe5270 observations of
GCs in NGC 7252 largely removes the age metallicity degeneracy and allows for
accurate age dating as well as for estimating the effects of self enrichment.

Evolution of the coalescence rate of double neutron stars (NS) and neutron
star -- black hole (BH) binaries are computed for model galaxies with different
star formation rates. Assuming gamma-ray bursts (GRB) to originate from NS+NS
or NS+BH merging in distant galaxies, theoretical logN--logS distributions and
<V/V_max> tests of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are calculated for the first time
taking the computed merging rates into account. We use a flat cosmological
model (Omega=1) with different values of the cosmological constant Lambda and
under various assumptions about the star formation history in galaxies. The
calculated source evolution predicts a 5-10 times increase of the source
statistics at count rates 3-10 times lower than the exising BATSE sensitivity
limit. The most important parameter in fitting the 2nd BATSE catalogue is the
initial redshift of star formation, which is found to be z_*=2-5 depending on a
poorly determined average spectral index of GRB.

We quantify the morphologies and dynamical states of 59 galaxy clusters using
the power-ratio technique of Buote & Tsai applied to ROSAT PSPC X-ray images.
The clusters exhibit a particularly strong $P_2/P_0 - P_4/P_0$ correlation in
the $1h^{-1}_{80}$ Mpc aperture which may be interpreted as an evolutionary
track; the location of a cluster on the correlation line indicates the
dynamical state of the cluster and the distribution of clusters along this
track measures the rate of formation and evolution of clusters in our sample.
The power ratios anti-correlate with the cooling-flow rate indicating a
reasonable dependence of the flow rate on cluster morphology. The relationship
of the power ratios to the optical Bautz-Morgan (BM) Type is more complex. This
is because the power ratios are sensitive to unrelaxed regions of clusters
within a specified scale, whereas BM types are sensitive to unrelaxed regions
over many scales. We discuss further astrophysical applications exploiting the
relationship between the power ratios and the evolutionary states of clusters.

The stability of a galaxy model is most easily assessed through N-body
simulation. Particle-mesh codes have been widely used for this purpose, since
they enable the largest numbers of particles to be employed. We show that the
functional expansion technique, originally proposed by Clutton-Brock for other
simulation problems, is in fact superior for stability work. For simulations of
linear evolution it is not much slower than grid methods using the same number
of particles, and reproduces analytical results with much greater accuracy.
This success rests on its ability to represent global modes with a modest
number of basis functions; grid methods may be more effective for other
applications, however. Our conclusions are based on implementations of
functional expansion and grid algorithms for disk galaxies.

Observations of interstellar lithium provide a valuable complement to studies
of lithium in Pop I and Pop II stars. Large corrections for unseen LiII and for
non-gas phase lithium have provided obstacles to using interstellar data for
abundance determinations. An approach to surmounting these difficulties is
proposed and is applied to the Galaxy and the LMC. The key is that since
potassium and lithium behave similarly regarding ionization and depletion,
their observed ratio (LiI/KI) can be used to probe the abundance and evolution
of lithium. For ten lines-of-sight in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy
(ISM) the Li/K ratio observed $(\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM} = - 1.88 \pm 0.09)$ is
entirely consistent with the solar system value $(\log (N_{Li}/N_{K})_{\odot} =
- 1.82 \pm 0.05)$. The absence of LiI in front of SN87A in the LMC, coupled
with the observed KI, corresponds to an upper bound (at $\rsim 95 \% \ CL$) of
$\log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{LMC} < - 0.3 + \log (N_{Li}/N_K)_{ISM}.$ This low upper
bound to LMC lithium suggests that cosmic lithium is on its way up from a
primordial abundance lower, by at least a factor of two, than the present Pop I
value of $[Li]_{PopI} \equiv 12 + \log (Li/H)_{PopI} = 3.2 \pm 0.1$.

We analyzed ROSAT PSPC images of the bright, nearby $(z<0.1)$ galaxy clusters
A401, A1656 (Coma), A2029, A2199, and A2256 to constrain their intrinsic shapes
and baryon fractions. Following Buote & Tsai we probed the aggregate structure
of the clusters on scales $\sim 1.5h^{-1}_{80}$ Mpc to reduce effects of
possible substructure on smaller scales ($\lesssim$ a few hundred kpc). The
ellipticities of the X-ray isophotes are typically $\epsilon\approx 0.15 -
0.25$ and display negative radial gradients significant (except Coma). By
assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and a variety of mass models we obtain
ellipticities $\epsilon_{mass} \approx 0.40-0.55$ for isothermal models of the
total gravitating matter of the clusters; the $\epsilon_{mass}$ constraints
change by $<10%$ upon consideration of the small temperature gradients shown by
ASCA to be typical for rich clusters; the observed X-ray ellipticity gradients
require that mass models with constant ellipticity have steep density profiles,
$\rho\propto r^{-4}$. Estimates of the gas masses are highly insensitive to the
ellipticities of the X-ray isophotes. The clusters in our sample have
increasing fractions of gas mass to total mass with radius and have
$M_{gas}/M_{tot} = (4% - 11%)h^{-3/2}_{80}$ within a radius $1.5h^{-1}_{80}$
Mpc, in excellent agreement with the results of White & Fabian and the Baryon
Catastrophe proposed by White et al. (1993). Finally, the ellipticities of the
dark matter distributions are essentially identical to $\epsilon_{mass}$ and
are consistent with the shapes of dark halos predicted by N-body simulations
and the shapes of the galaxy isopleths in the clusters in contrast to our
previous conclusions using {\it Einstein} data.

A combined N--body/SPH code is presented which benefits from the high speed
of the special purpose hardware GRAPE (GRAvity PipE). Besides gravitational
forces, GRAPE also returns the list of neighbours and can, therefore, be used
to speed up the hydrodynamical part, too. After the interaction list has been
passed, density, pressure forces, propagation and interpolation of particles
etc. are calculated on the front end, a 50 MHz SUN SPARC 10. In order to
combine SPH and GRAPE, possible limitations due to the hardware design of GRAPE
are carefully analyzed and modifications compared to current SPH codes are
discussed. The resulting code, GRAPESPH, is similarly flexible as TREESPH. It
seems especially well suited to investigate the formation of individual objects
in a large scale structure environment, like eg. galaxies or clusters. The
total performance is at least half as good as treesph on a CRAY and for most
applications it seems to be even better. The CPU time per time step is only
slightly dependent on the clustering state. GRAPESPH, therefore, provides a
very attractive alternative to the use of supercomputers in cosmology.

We examine the dynamics of a rotating viscous fluid following an abrupt
change in the angular velocity of the solid bounding surface. We include the
effects of a density stratification and compressibility which are important in
astrophysical objects such as neutron stars. We confirm and extend the
conclusions of previous studies that stratification restricts the Ekman pumping
process to a relatively thin layer near the boundary, leaving much of the
interior fluid unaffected. We find that finite compressibility further inhibits
Ekman pumping by decreasing the extent of the pumped layer and by increasing
the time for spin-up. The results of this paper are important for interpreting
the spin period discontinuities (``glitches'') observed in rotating neutron
stars.

We present the results of a 7 year long photometric monitoring of two
components (A and B) of UM 425, thought to be images, separated by 6.5", of the
same z = 1.47 quasar. These components have been imaged through an R filter in
order to obtain their light curves. The photometry was obtained by
simultaneously fitting a stellar two-dimensional profile on each component. The
brightest image (component A, m(R) = 15.7) shows a slow and smooth increase in
brightness of 0.2 magnitude in seven years, while the faintest one (component
B, m(R) = 20.1) displays an outburst of 0.4 magnitude which lasts approximately
two years. The variation of component B may be interpreted in two ways,
assuming UM 425 is gravitationally lensed. If it is due to an intrinsic
variation of the quasar, we derive a lower limit of 3 years on the time delay
from the fact that it is not observed in component A. On the other hand, if it
is a microlensing ``High Amplification Event'', we estimate the size of the
source to be ~ 10^{-3} pc, in agreement with standard models of AGNs. These
observations are consistent with the gravitational lens interpretation of the
object.
  Furthermore, all the CCD frames obtained under the best seeing conditions
have been co-added, in an attempt to detect the deflector. The final R image
reveals a rich field of faint galaxies in the magnitude range m(R) 22-24. No
obvious deflector, nor any system of arcs or arclets is detected, down to a
limiting magnitude of m(R) 24.

Inflation produces nearly Harrison-Zel'dovich scalar and tensor perturbation
spectra which lead to anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The
amplitudes and shapes of these spectra can be parametrized by $Q_S^2$, $r\equiv
Q_T^2/Q_S^2$, $n_S$ and $n_T$ where $Q_S^2$ and $Q_T^2$ are the scalar and
tensor contributions to the square of the CMB quadrupole and $n_S$ and $n_T$
are the power-lawspectral indices. Even if we restrict ourselves to information
from angles greater than one third of a degree, three of these observables can
be measured with some precision. The combination $130^{1-n_S}Q_S^2$ can be
known to better than $\pm 0.3\%$. The scalar index $n_S$ can be determined to
better than $\pm 0.02$. The ratio $r$ can be known to about $\pm 0.1$ for $n_S
\simeq 1$ and slightly better for smaller $n_S$. The precision with which $n_T$
can be measured depends weakly on $n_S$ and strongly on $r$. For $n_S \simeq 1$
$n_T$ can be determined with a precision of about $\pm 0.056(1.5+r)/r$. A
full-sky experiment with a $20'$beam using technology available today, similar
to those being planned by several groups, can achieve the above precision. Good
angular resolution is more important than high signal-to-noise ratio; for a
given detector sensitivity and observing time a smaller beam provides
significantly more information than a larger beam. The uncertainties in $n_S$
and $r$ are roughly proportional to the beam size. We briefly discuss the
effects of uncertainty in the Hubble constant, baryon density, cosmological
constant and ionization history.

We reassess the importance of photon splitting to spectral formation in
cosmic X-ray and $\gamma$-ray sources with magnetic fields of several $10^{12}$
gauss. Our analysis is based on the recent numerically accurate evaluation of
the full relativistic expression for photon splitting at neutron star magnetic
field strengths (Mentzel et al. 1994). Using these results we demonstrate that
Adler's (1971) widely used approximation formula for photon splitting
underestimates the correct splitting rate by {\em several} orders of magnitude,
at these magnetic field strengths. Even down at X-ray energies of a few tens of
keV magnetic photon splitting is found to be an efficient photon conversion
process, producing mean free paths as short as several tens of centimeters for
fields on the order of $5 \times 10^{12}$ gauss. We conclude that previous
analyses of the contributions of magnetic photon splitting to spectral
formation based on Adler's approximation formula are physically unreliable,
and, in particular, that photon splitting must be included in realistic
modelings of spectra of both strongly magnetized cosmic X-ray and $\gamma$-ray
sources.

We derive Galactic continuum spectra from 5-96/cm from COBE/FIRAS
observations. The spectra are dominated by warm dust emission, which may be fit
with a single temperature in the range 16-21 K (for nu^2 emissivity) along each
line of sight. Dust heated by the attenuated radiation field in molecular
clouds gives rise to intermediate temperature (10-14 K) emission in the inner
Galaxy only. A widespread, very cold component (4-7 K) with optical depth that
is spatially correlated with the warm component is also detected. The cold
component is unlikely to be due to very cold dust shielded from starlight,
because it is present at high latitude. We consider hypotheses that the cold
component is due to enhanced submillimeter emissivity of the dust that gives
rise to the warm component, or that it may be due to very small, large, or
fractal particles. Lack of substantial power above the emission from warm dust
places strong constraints on the amount of cold gas in the Galaxy. The
microwave sky brightness due to interstellar dust is dominated by the cold
component, and its angular variation could limit our ability to discern
primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Cosmic microwave background anisotropies provide a vast amount of information
on both structure formation in the universe and the background dynamics and
geometry. The full physical content and detailed structure of anisotropies can
be understood in a simple and intuitive fashion through a systematic
investigation of the individual mechanisms for anisotropy formation, based on
elementary gravitational and fluid dynamics.

The polarization data of the radio galaxy NGC4869, belonging to the Coma
cluster and located in its central region, allow us to obtain information on
the structure of magnetic field associated with the cluster itself. A magnetic
field of $\sim$ 8.5 $\mu$G, tangled on scales of the order of less than 1 kpc,
is required to explain the observed fluctuations of the rotation measure. This
magnetic field is more than one order of magnitude stronger than the
equipartition value obtained for Coma C. This implies that the halo source Coma
C may not be at the equipartition. Moreover, the need of efficient
reacceleration mechanisms for the electrons radiating in Coma C is stronger.
The energy supply to the Coma C radiating electrons is probably provided by the
cluster merger process.

We present spectra and high-resolution images taken with HST, the NTT, the
VLA, and the MPIA/ESO 2.2m of the emission-line star He 3-1475 which we suggest
is a post-AGB star. The star is at the origin of a 15-arcsec-long structure
containing symmetrically opposing bright knots. The knots have radial
velocities of about 500 km/s from the center of He 3-1475 to the ends of the
jets. HST snapshots show that the core of He 3-1475 is unipolar with a star at
the SE end and the nebula fanning out toward the NW. VLA observations show the
presence of OH masers, which are positioned parallel to the optical jets. A
model is proposed that accounts for all of the observational data. This unusual
object may link the OH/IR stars having extreme outflow velocities with highly
bipolar planetary nebulae.

Our goal in this paper is to test some popular dark matter models by Ly-alpha
forest in QSO spectra. Recent observations of the size and velocity of Ly-alpha
forest clouds have indicated that the Ly-alpha absorption is probably not given
by collapsed objects, but pre-collapsed regions in the baryonic density field.
Therefore, a linear approximation description would be able to provide valuable
information. We developed a technique to simulate Ly-alpha forest as the
absorption of such pre-collapsed regions under linear approximation regime. The
simulated Ly-alpha forests in models of the standard cold dark matter (SCDM),
the cold plus hot dark matter (CHDM), and the low-density flat cold dark matter
(LCDM) have been confronted with observational features, including 1) the
number density of Ly-alpha lines and its dependencies on redshift and
equivalent width; 2) the distribution of equivalent widths and its redshift
dependence; 3) clustering; and 4) the Gunn-Peterson effect. The "standard" CHDM
model, i.e. 60% cold and 30% hot dark matters and 10\% baryons, is found to be
difficult to pass the Ly-alpha forest test, probably because it produces
structures too late and favors to form structures on large scales instead of
small scale objects like Ly-alpha clouds. Within a reasonable range of J_nu,
the UV background radiation at high redshift, and delta_th, the threshold of
the onset of gravitational collapse of the baryonic matter, the LCDM model is
consistent with observational data in all above-mentioned four aspects. The
model of SCDM can also fit with observation, but it requires a smaller J_nu and
a higher delta_th. This suggests that whether a significant part of the
Ly-alpha forest lines is located in the halos of collapsed objects would be
crucial to the success of SCDM.

We use a free-energy minimization approach to describe the secular and
dynamical instabilities as well as the bifurcations along equilibrium sequences
of rotating, self-gravitating fluid systems. Our approach is fully nonlinear
and stems from the Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions. In this paper,
we examine fourth-harmonic axisymmetric disturbances in Maclaurin spheroids and
fourth-harmonic nonaxisymmetric disturbances in Jacobi ellipsoids. These two
cases are very similar in the framework of phase transitions. Irrespective of
whether a nonlinear first-order phase transition occurs between the critical
point and the higher turning point or an apparent second-order phase transition
occurs beyond the higher turning point, the result is fission (i.e.
``spontaneous breaking'' of the topology) of the original object on a secular
time scale: the Maclaurin spheroid becomes a uniformly rotating axisymmetric
torus and the Jacobi ellipsoid becomes a binary. The presence of viscosity is
crucial since angular momentum needs to be redistributed for uniform rotation
to be maintained. The phase transitions of the dynamical systems are briefly
discussed in relation to previous numerical simulations of the formation and
evolution of protostellar systems.

The isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts as observed with the Burst and
Transient Experiment (BATSE) strongly suggests that the bursts are at
cosmological distances. At such distances, the expansion of the universe should
redshift the spectra and stretch the temporal structure. We relate the observed
peak intensities, spectral shapes, and time dilation to distance. We include
the uncertainties in our knowledge of the intrinsic spectrum and correct for
the coupling between the spectral shape and the temporal structure. The
reported time dilation between the dimmest BATSE bursts and the bright BATSE
bursts (a factor of 2) requires a redshift of about 6 for the BATSE dimmest
bursts rather than a redshift of 1 or 2 as previously reported. The large
luminosity and distance determined from the time dilation is inconsistent with
the observed Log N-Log P distribution. unless there is very strong evolution.
The implied distance for the dimmest bursts is beyond where galaxies are
thought to form. If true, the gamma-ray bursts would be orphans: no known
objects would have the same distance scale. We conclude that either a large
fraction (65%) of the observed time dilation between the BATSE bright and
dimmest bursts is intrinsic to the bursts or that there are strong evolutionary
effects in the Log N-Log P distribution and that it is only a coincidence that
Log N-Log P shows a -3/2 power law at high intensities.

We calculate the time- and energy-dependent opacity of high-energy gamma-rays
attenuated by pair production interaction with accretion-flare photons that are
scattered by gas and dust surrounding thenuclei of active galaxies. We show
that the temporal behavior of the high-energy opacity cutoff can be used in
conjunction with the time history of the accretion flare to determine the
location of the gamma-ray emission site, as well as the column density and
scale height of the material surrounding the central engine. Reverberation
mapping using this technique is possible for nearby BL Lac objects and will be
particularly valuable when the 10 -- 100 GeV gamma-ray window is opened,
because there the attenuation of distant blazar radiation by the IIBR is
negligible.

The distribution of neutron stars (NS's) is determined by stationary solution
of the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work using the observed period changes
for four systems: Vela X-1, GX 301-2, Her X-1 and Cen X-3 we determined D, the
'diffusion coefficient',-parameter from the Fokker-Planck equation. Using
strong dependence of D on the velocity for Vela X-1 and GX 301-2, systems
accreting from a stellar wind, we determined the stellar wind velocity. For
different assumptions for a turbulent velocity we obtained $V=(660-1440) km s
^{-1}$. It is in good agreement with the stellar wind velocity determined by
other methods. We also determined the specific characteristic time scales for
the 'diffusion processes' in X-ray pulsars. It is of order of 200 sec for
wind-fed pulsars and 1000-10000 sec for the disk accreting systems.

X-ray binary population at the Galactic center is proposed here to form as a
result of a starburst, which is synthesized by using the ``Scenario Machine''
code of binary star evolution. For the currently assumed starburst age of 4-7
millions years, our results are consistent with the recent {\it GRANAT} X-ray
observations of the Galactic center and predict a substantial number of X-ray
binaries with black holes.

Based on a cross-correlation analysis of X-ray selected QSOs with faint
(B<20.5) galaxies, we find a 5sigma galaxy excess around low-redshift (z<0.3)
QSOs with an amplitude identical to that of the galaxy angular correlation
function. The similarity between QSO-galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
clustering suggests that QSOs are unbiased with respect to galaxies and make
useful tracers of large-scale structure in the Universe.

We present the results of an intermediate-resolution (1.5\AA) spectroscopic
study of 17 X-ray luminous narrow emission-line galaxies previously identified
in the Cambridge-Cambridge {\it ROSAT} Serendipity Survey and the {\it
Einstein} Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey. Emission-line ratios reveal that
the sample is composed of ten Seyfert and seven starburst galaxies. Measured
linewidths for the narrow H$\alpha$ emission lines lie in the range
$170-460\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$. Five of the objects show clear evidence for
asymmetry in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission-line profile. Broad H$\alpha$
emission is detected in six of the Seyfert galaxies, which range in type from
Seyfert 1.5 to 2. Broad H$\beta$ emission is only detected in one Seyfert
galaxy. The mean full width at half maximum for the broad lines in the Seyfert
galaxies is ${\rm FWHM = 3900\pm 1750\,km\,s^{-1}}$. Broad (${\rm FWHM =
2200\pm 600\,km\,s^{-1}}$) $H\alpha$ emission is also detected in three of the
starburst galaxies, which could originate from stellar winds or supernovae
remnants. The mean Balmer decrement for the sample is H$\alpha$/H$\beta=3$,
consistent with little or no reddening for the bulk of the sample. There is no
evidence for any trend with X-ray luminosity in the ratio of starburst galaxies
to Seyfert galaxies. Based on our previous observations, it is therefore likely
that both classes of object comprise $\sim 10\,$per cent of the $2\,$keV X-ray
background.

We present the first results of a campaign to secure deep UBVRI CCD
photometric calibration in all UK Schmidt equatorial fields with galactic
latitudes |b| > 50deg. In this paper we provide information on deep BVRI
sequences (B<22) in 14 UK Schmidt survey fields centred at declination=0deg.
Deep U sequences have been obtained for 11 of these fields.

(compressed version) We combine the CfA Redshift Survey (CfA2) and the
Southern Sky Redshift Survey (SSRS2) to estimate the pairwise velocity
dispersion of galaxies $\sig12$ on a scale of $\sim 1 \hmpc$. Both surveys are
complete to an apparent magnitude limit $B(0)=15.5$. Our sample includes 12,812
galaxies distributed in a volume $1.8 \times 10^6 \hmpc3$. We conclude: 1) The
pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the combined CfA2+SSRS2 redshift
survey is $\sig12=540 \kms \pm 180 \kms$. Both the estimate and the variance of
$\sig12$ significantly exceed the canonical values $\sig12=340 \pm40$ measured
by Davis \& Peebles (1983) using CfA1. 2) We derive the uncertainty in $\sig12$
from the variation among subsamples with volumes on the order of $7 \times
10^5$ \hmpc3. This variation is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the
formal error, 36 $\kms$, derived using least-squares fits to the CfA2+SSRS2
correlation function. This variation among samples is consistent with the
conclusions of Mo \etal (1993) for a number of smaller surveys and with the
analysis of CfA1 by Zurek \etal (1994). 3) When we remove Abell clusters with
$R\ge1$ from our sample, the pairwise velocity dispersion of the remaining
galaxies drops to $295 \pm 99 \kms$. Thus the dominant source of variance in
$\sig12$ is the shot noise contributed by dense virialized systems. 4) The
distribution of pairwise velocities is consistent with an isotropic exponential
with velocity dispersion independent of scale.

Density perturbations at the decoupling epoch produce angular fluctuations in
the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation that may
appear as hot and cold spots. Observational data of the CMB includes
instrumental noise in addition to the cosmological signal. One would like to
determine which of the observed spots are produced by the noise and which
correspond to signal. In this work we first present a statistical analysis of
the first plus second year COBE/DMR map at 53 GHz that reveals the presence of
cosmological signal in the data. The analysis is based on Harrison-Zeldovich
Monte Carlo realizations and utilizes a generalized $\chi^2$ statistic. The
method is applied to the number of spots and the fraction of the total area
that appear above/below a certain value of the dispersion of the noise,
including and excluding the quadrupole, giving $Q_{rms-PS}=15^{+3}_{-6}$,
$18^{+5}_{-7} \mu K$ and $Q_{rms-PS}=18^{+3}_{-4}$, $21\pm6 \mu K$, at the
$95\%$ confidence level, respectively. The data taken by the COBE/DMR
experiment during the first two years at three different frequencies (31, 53
and 90 GHz) are used to determine which of the spots observed at 53 GHz appear
simultaneously in the other two channels. The significance of those spots is
determined by comparison of their area and signal-to-noise with noise Monte
Carlo simulations. We point out two cold spots and one hot spot at positions
$(l,b)\approx (-99^{\circ},57^{\circ}),(-21^{\circ},-45^{\circ}),
(-81^{\circ},-33^{\circ})$ respectively, at the $95 \%$ confidence level.

The Press-Schechter(PS) formalism for the mass function of the collapsed
objects are reanalyzed. The factor of two in the Press-Schechter formalism is
argued to be correct in the sharp $k$-space filter even when we use the another
approach proposed by Jedamzik(1994) in the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is
different from the previous approach by Peacock & Heavens(1990) and Bond et
al.(1991). The spatial correlation of the density fluctuations, however, had
been neglected in the cloud-in-cloud problem. The effects of this spatial
correlation is analyzed by using the Jedamzik formalism and it is found that
this effect alter the PS mass function especially on larger mass scales.
Furthermore the exact formula of deriving mass function is shown. We also find
that the probability of the overlap of the collapsed objects can be neglected
on very small mass scales while it might not be neglected on other mass scales.

The global nonlinear time dependent evolution of accretion disk-corona
systems in X-ray binary sources has been investigated to provide an
understanding of the low frequency ($\sim 0.04$~Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) observed recently in the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335 and in some black
hole candidates sources (Cyg X--1 and GRO~J0422+32). We consider
$\alpha$-viscosity models in which the viscous stress is proportional to the
total pressure. In contrast to previous time dependent studies it is assumed
that all mass accretion and angular momentum transport take place in an
optically thick disk, but that a fraction of the gravitational energy that is
released is dissipated in a corona. It is found that the coronal energy
dissipation can effectively reduce the amplitudes of the mass flow variations
generated from the thermal and viscous instabilities (in comparison to models
without a corona) to a state in which the disk exhibits mild oscillatory
nonsteady behavior. These oscillations are globally coherent in the unstable
regions of the disk. A model for the high and low states of black hole
candidate systems is also proposed. It is suggested that the low state, which
is characterized by a hard X-ray spectrum, corresponds to a disk configuration
in which the inner disk is in an advection dominated hot optically thin state
whereas the high state corresponds to a configuration in which the inner disk
is in an optically thick state surrounded by a corona. In this model, the mass
accretion rate in the system is higher in the low state than in the high state.
The hard X-ray spectrum of QPOs observed in the low state can be naturally
explained by such a model.

Gamma-ray burst time histories often consist of many peaks. These peaks tend
to be narrower at higher energy. If gamma-ray bursts are cosmological, the
energy dependence of gamma-ray burst time scales must be understood in order to
correct the time scale dependence due to the expansion of the universe. By
using the average autocorrelation function and the average pulse width, we show
that the narrowing with energy follows, quite well, a power law. The power law
index is about -0.4. This is the first quantitative relationship between
temporal and spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts. It is unclear what physics
causes this relationship. The average autocorrelation has a universal shape
such that one energy range scales linearly with time into all other energy
ranges. This shape is approximately the sum of two exponential.

HST images (WFC2) of \pks show that this luminous nearby quasar is
interacting with diffuse (presumably galactic) material. Two thin wisps that
have a total extent of about 20 kpc (for $H_0 = 100$ \kms ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and
$\Omega_0 = 1.0$) are observed to approximately surround the quasar. One of the
wisps appears to pass through a companion galaxy that is located at a projected
distance of three~kpc from the center of the quasar light. The companion
galaxy, if located at the distance of \pks, has an intrinsic size and
luminosity similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud. A faint extended nebulosity,
which is detected over a region of 35 kpc by 50 kpc and is centered about 5 kpc
from the quasar nucleus, overlaps the wisps. The immediate environment of \pks
is different from the enivronments of the other eight luminous quasars that we
have studied previously with HST. If the multiple light components of the HST
images are fit to a single de~Vaucouleurs profile, as was done in previous
analyses of ground--based data, then the result obtained for the total
luminosity of the model galaxy is in agreement with the earlier ground-based
studies.

Most cosmological models for gamma-ray bursts invoke the production of a
``fireball'' in a compact region, as indicated by the short time variability of
the observed GRBs. The high density of $e^+e^-$ pairs in such fireballs
inevitably makes them opaque to gamma-rays and requires the gamma-ray emission
to take place only after the fireball has expanded and became optically thin to
gamma's. Many of the ``traditional'' scenarios explain the temporal variability
of GRBs as being formed by growing instabilities in the expanding fireball.
Here we explore this possiblity and examine its validity.

The mass function of 51 Massive Compact Objects (MACHOs) detected toward the
Galactic bulge is statistically estimated from Einstein ring crossing times
$t_{\rm e}$. For a Gaussian mass function, the best fitting parameters are
$\langle \log (m/M_{\odot}) \rangle = -1.12$ and $\sigma_{\log (m/M_{\odot})} =
0.57$. If the mass function follows a power-law distribution, the best fitting
mass cut-off and power are $m_{\rm cut} = 0.04\ M_{\odot}$ and $p = -2.1$. Both
mass spectra indicate that a significant fraction of events are caused by
MACHOs in substellar mass range. Both best determined mass functions are
compared with that obtained from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. The
power law is marginally favored ($2.3\sigma$) over the Gaussian mass function,
and significantly over HST mass function ($5.5\sigma$), indicating that MACHOs
have a different mass function from stars in the solar neighborhood. In
addition, the fact that all the models have very poor fits to the longest four
events with $t_{e} \geq 70\ {\rm days}$ remains a puzzle.

We present the second part of the OGLE Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars in
the Galactic bulge. 800 variable stars found in four Baade's Window fields BW1,
BW2, BW3 and BW4 are presented. Among them 71 are classified as pulsating, 465
as eclipsing and 264 as miscellaneous type. The Catalog and individual
observations are available in digital form from the OGLE Internet archive.

Recent observations of microlensing events in the Large Magellanic Cloud
suggest that a sizeable fraction of the galactic halo is in form of MACHOs with
mass less than abou 0.1 M_{\odot}. Here we argue that molecular clouds (mainly
H_2) located in the galactic halo can contribute substantially to its total
mass. We outline a scenario in which dark clusters of MACHOs and molecular
clouds naturally form in the halo at large galactocentric distances. Possible
ways of detecting MACHOs via infrared emission and molecular clouds via the
induced gamma-ray flux are discussed. Molecular clouds located in the M31 dark
halo could be discovered through cosmic background radiation (CBR) anisotropies
or emission lines in the microwave band.

The recently observed Deuterium abundance in a low- metallicity high-redshift
hydrogen cloud, which is about ten times larger than that observed in the near
interstellar medium, is that expected from the Standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis theory and the observed abundances of $^4$He and $^7$Li
extrapolated to their primordial values. The inferred cosmic baryon to photon
ratio, $\eta=(1.60\pm 0.1)\times 10^{-10},$ yields a mean cosmic baryon
density, in critical mass units, of $\Omega_b\approx (0.6\pm 0.1)\times
10^{-2}h^{-2},$ with $h$ being the Hubble constant in units of $100 km~s^{-1}
Mpc^{-1}$. This baryon density is consistent with the mean cosmic density of
matter visible optically and in X-rays. It implies that most of the baryons in
the Universe are visible and are not dark. Combined with the observed ratio of
baryons to light in X-ray emitting clusters, it yields the value $\Omega
\approx 0.15$ for the mean mass density of the Universe, which is consistent
with that obtained from the mass to light ratio in clusters. This mass density
is about ten times larger than the mean baryon mass density. It indicates that
most of the matter in the Universe consists of nonbaryonic dark matter.

Blazar emission of gamma rays and cosmic ray production of gamma rays in
gas-rich clusters have been proposed recently as alternative sources of the
high energy extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background radiation. We show that
these sources also produce a very different high energy extragalactic diffuse
neutrino background radiation. This neutrino background may be detected by the
new generation of large neutrino telescopes under construction and may be used
to trace the origin of the extragalactic gamma radiation.

A crucial issue in cosmology is the determination of the fluctuation power
spectrum.The standard picture of the matter clustering, the Cold Dark Matter
model (and its variant), assumes that,on scales smaller than a certain
``flattening scale'' $\lambda_f$, the power spectrum increases with the scale,
while on much larger scales it decreases so to match the tiny fluctuations
observed in the microwave background. The standard picture also assumes that,
once a statistically homogeneous sample is reached, the power spectrum
amplitude is fixed, and any major variation should be attributed to luminosity
segregation. However, the determination of $\lambda_f$ and of the absolute
amplitude, if any, is still matter of debate. In particular, there is no
consensus on whether the turnaround has been detected or not, and on the actual
importance of the luminosity segregation effect. We show that, due to the
finiteness of the sample the standard analysis of self-similar (fractal)
distributions yields a turnaround for scales close to the survey scale, and a
systematic amplitude shift with the survey scale. We point out that both
features, bending and scaling, are in agreement with recent determination of
the power spectrum, in particular with the CfA2 spectrum. We remark that the
standard power spectrum is not a well defined statistical tool to characterize
the galaxy distribution when a homogeneity scale has not been reached. In order
to perform an analysis that does not imply any a priori assumption one should
study the PS of the density, rather than the PS of the density contrast.

We propose a new technique, which we call the lens parallax method, to
determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies
and the mass distributions of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is
based on gravitational lensing and makes use of the following: (1) the
amplitude of lensing-induced distortions of background galaxies increases with
redshift; (2) the surface brightnesses of galaxies decrease steeply with
redshift. The distortions of galaxy images due to lensing are thus expected to
be inversely correlated with surface brightness, allowing us to obtain relative
distances to galaxies as a function of surface brightness. If the redshifts of
the brightest galaxies are measured, then the relative distance scale can be
converted to mean galaxy redshifts as a function of surface brightness.
Further, by comparing the angular sizes of lensed galaxies with those of
similar galaxies in empty control fields, it is possible to break the so-called
mass sheet degeneracy inherent to cluster mass reconstruction techniques which
are based purely on image ellipticities. This allows an unambiguous
determination of the surface density of a lensing cluster. We describe an
iterative algorithm based on these ideas and present numerical simulations
which show that the proposed techniques are feasible with a sample of ~ 10 rich
clusters at moderate redshifts ~ 0.3-0.4 and an equal number of control fields.
The numerical tests show that the method can be used to determine the redshifts
of galaxies with an accuracy of dz ~ 0.1-0.2 at z ~ 1-1.7, and to measure the
masses of lensing clusters to about 5% accuracy.

We have found that the white dwarf PG 1101+364 is a double-lined white
dwarf/white dwarf binary with an orbital period of 3.47 hours. PG 1101+364 is
the shortest period detached double-degenerate yet found and gravitational
radiation will cause it to merge in 2.5 X 10**9 years. PG 1101+364 has a mass
ratio of 0.87 +/- 0.03. From the relative strengths of the narrow core of
Halpha, the lighter and therefore larger star appears to contribute more of the
light by an amount that indicates almost equal temperatures for the two stars.
We chose to observe PG 1101+364 on the basis of its low spectroscopic mass
(0.31 Msun), and the discovery of its binary nature confirms the belief that
binary evolution is required to produce such low mass white dwarfs. The radial
velocity semi-amplitudes (69.7 +/- 1.7 km/s and 80.3 +/- 1.6 km/s) and the
spectroscopic mass show that we see the orbit of PG 1101+364 at a low
inclination of ~ 25 deg.

A first- and second-order relation between cosmic density and
peculiar-velocity fields is presented. The calculation is purely Lagrangian and
it is derived using the second-order solutions of the Lagrange-Newton system
obtained by Buchert & Ehlers. The procedure is applied to two particular
solutions given generic initial conditions. In this approach, the continuity
equation yields a relation between the over-density and peculiar-velocity
fields that automatically satisfies Euler's equation because the orbits are
derived from the Lagrange-Newton system. This scheme generalizes some results
obtained by Nusser et al. (1991) in the context of the Zel'dovich
approximation. As opposed to several other reconstruction schemes, in this
approach it is not necessary to truncate the expansion of the Jacobian given by
the continuity equation in order to calculate a first- or second-order
expression for the density field. In these previous schemes, the density
contrast given by (a) the continuity equation and (b) Euler's equation are
mutually incompatible. This inconsistency arises as a consequence of an
improper handling of Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates in the analysis. Here,
we take into account the fact that an exact calculation of the density is
feasible in the Lagrangian picture and therefore an accurate and consistent
description is obtained.

Accurate characterization of thick disc properties from recent kinematic and
photometric surveys provides converging evidences that this intermediate
population is a sequel of the violent heating of early disc populations by a
merging satellite galaxy.
  The thick disc population is revisited under the light of new data in a
number of galactic sample fields. Various thick disc hypotheses are fitted to
observational data through a maximum likelihood technique. The resulting
characteristics of the thick disc are the following : a scale height of 760
$\pm$ 50 pc, with a local density of 5.6 $\pm$ 1 \% of the thin disc. The scale
length is constrained to be 2.8 $\pm$ 0.8 kpc, well in agreement with the disc
scale length (2.5 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc). The mean metallicity of the thick disc is
found to be -0.7 $\pm$ 0.2 dex, with no {significant} metallicity gradients.
  These photometric constraints in combination with kinematic data give new
constraints on the thick disc formation. We show that thick disc
characteristics are {hardly compatible with a top-down formation scenario} but
fully compatible with a violent merging event arising at the early thin disc
life time as described by Quinn, Hernquist \& Fullagar (1993).

By monitoring $10^6$ quasars one could search for lensing by stars and
Massive Compact Halo Objects (Machos) out to redshifts $z\sim 4$. If Machos
have a present cosmological density $\Omega_{L,0}=1\%$, then the expected event
rate is $\Gamma\sim 200\,\yr^{-1}$. The expected event rate for known stars in
galaxies is $\Gamma\sim 20\,\yr^{-1}$ assuming that their present cosmological
density is $\Omega_{L,0}=0.3\%$. Typical event times are $t_e\sim 3\,\yr$ for
Machos and $t_e\sim 10\,\yr$ for stars. By comparing the optical depths to
quasars at different redshifts, one could measure the star-formation and
Macho-formation history of the universe. By comparing the time scales of events
found parallel and perpendicular to the Sun's motion relative to the microwave
background, one could measure or constrain the characteristic scale of large
scale motions. The lensing events themselves would help probe the structure of
quasars on scales of 50--1500 AU. The monitoring program could be carried out
with a single dedicated 1 m telescope with a 4 deg${}^2$ camera. Quasar lensing
events can be unambiguously distinguished from quasar variability because in
the former case the broad lines are unaffected while in the latter they respond
to the variation in the continuum on times scales $\sim 1\,\yr$.

Along the life of the IUE project, a large archive with spectral data has
been generated, requiring automated classification methods to be analyzed in an
objective form. Previous automated classification methods used with IUE spectra
were based on multivariate statistics. In this paper, we compare two
classification methods that can be directly applied to spectra in the archive:
metric distance and artificial neural networks. These methods are used to
classify IUE low-dispersion spectra of normal stars with spectral types ranging
from O3 to G5. The classification based on artificial neural networks performs
better than the metric distance, allowing the determination of the spectral
classes with an accuracy of 1.1 spectral subclasses.

We report on AGN with extremely soft X-ray spectra observed with ROSAT. From
their optical emission lines these objects are classified as narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1), almost all with extremely large Fe II/H-beta ratios
and relatively narrow optical lines of hydrogen. Our results are based on a
systematic study of 46 NLS1. We find that NLS1 have generally steeper soft
X-ray continuum slopes than normal Seyfert 1s, and there may exist an
anticorrelation between 0.1-2.4 keV continuum slope and the FWHM of the H-beta
line. Objects with steep 0.1-2.4 keV continuum slopes and H-beta FWHM > 3000 km
s^{-1} are clearly discriminated against by nature. When simple power-law
models are fit to the data, photon indices reach values up to about 5, much
higher than is usually seen in Seyfert 1s. We discuss steep ROSAT spectra in
light of soft X-ray excess and hard X-ray tail models. We consider models for
NLS1 where they are Seyfert 1s with extremal values of pole-on orientation,
black hole mass and/or accretion rate, warm absorption and BLR thickness and
confront these models with the known properties of NLS1. All simple models
appear to have drawbacks, but models with smaller mass black holes and thicker
BLRs show some promise. We suggest specific further tests of the models.

Using numerical simulation, we study the response of a disk galaxy to a
merger involving a low-mass satellite companion. During a prograde satellite
accretion, the disk galaxy forms a strong bar in response to the perturbation
of the companion. After the accretion event is over, the bar buckles vertically
due to a bending instability, sending disk material well out of the disk plane.
The material forms into an X-shaped feature when seen edge-on, morphologically
similar to X-structures observed in several S0/Sa galaxies. The mechanism
described here unites previously suggested accretion and bar instability
hypotheses for forming X-structures into a self-consistent scenario for
merger-induced formation and evolution of S0 galaxies. To complement these
models, we also present observations of the peculiar S0 galaxy Hickson 87a. The
thick disk, isophotal warping, and strong X-structure described in the merger
model are all evident in Hickson 87a, suggesting this galaxy may be an
excellent example of such merger-induced galaxy evolution.

We present {\it ASCA} observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxies Mrk~1040 and
MS~0225.5+3121. Mrk~1040 was found to have decreased in flux by almost a factor
of 4 since an {\it EXOSAT} observation 10\,years ago. The energy spectrum of
Mrk~1040 displays complexity both at soft energies (below 0.8\thinspace keV)
and at hard energies (6--7\thinspace keV). The latter is readily interpreted as
fluorescent K$\alpha$ emission from cold iron expected when the primary X-ray
source illuminates cold optically-thick material. This line is both broad (with
FWHM 16\,000--70\,000 km\,s$^{-1}$) and strong (equivalent width $\sim 550\pm
250$\, eV) suggesting that it originates from material close to the compact
object with non-solar abundances. Abundance effects on the equivalent width of
such a line are investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. We find that strong
lines can be produced with physically plausible abundances. The effect of
abundances on the associated reflection continuum is also discussed. The soft
spectral complexity implies either a strong soft excess together with intrinsic
absorption, or a complex absorber. Various models for the nature of such a
complex absorber are discussed. MS~0225.5+3121 shows no evidence for any
variability and has a spectrum that is well described by a power law with
Galactic absorption.

Estimates of Omega_baryon from primordial nucleosynthesis together with
standard assumptions about the ionization state of low column density Lyman
alpha forest clouds can be used to determine an upper limit for the cloud
thickness along the line of sight. This upper limit provides significant
constraints on the axis ratio of the absorbers and on the overall fraction of
the baryonic matter contained in these objects if the recently measured large
values for their transversal size are representative. The absorbers have to be
considerably flattened structures and may possibly contain a substantial
fraction of the baryonic matter at high redshift.

It is already understood that the increasing observational evidence for an
open Universe may be reconciled with inflation if our horizon is contained
inside one single huge bubble nucleated during the inflationary phase
transition. In the scenario we present here, the Universe consists of
infinitely many superhorizon bubbles, like our own, the distribution of which
can be made to peak at $\Omega_0\approx 0.2$. Therefore, unlike the existing
literature, we do not have to rely upon the anthropic principle nor upon
special initial conditions.

Recent theoretical works on alternative metric theories of gravity give
greater significance to solar-system tests of General Relativity. In
particular, it is suggested that the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ ought to
be determined with great precision in order to discover possible preferred
frame effects or effects related to a tensor-scalar theory of gravitation. In
this work we focus on a future experiment, based on Doppler tracking of an
interplanetary spacecraft near superior conjunction.

Microlensing of distant stars in the Milky Way by the nearby high proper
motion stars offers a direct way to precisely measure the masses of single
lower main sequence stars and brown dwarfs.

Variations in polarization efficiency (p/A) of interstellar grains as a
function of environment place vital constraints on models for the mechanism of
their alignment. We use polarimetry of background field stars to investigate
alignment in the Taurus dark cloud as a function of optical depth for
extinctions of A_K < 2.5 (A_V < 25). Results show a strong systematic trend in
polarization efficiency with extinction. We discuss the possibility of a
relationship between p/A and icy grain mantle growth, since mantles are
detected in Taurus only for extinctions where p/A is lowest. A simple density
model of alignment by paramagnetic alignment (Davis & Greenstein 1951) predicts
that the magnetic field strength (B) scales with density to the power k=0.28.

In this paper we investigate the statistical properties of gravitational
lenses for models in which a cosmological term decreases with time as $\Lambda
\propto a^{-m}$, where $a$ is the scale factor and $m$ is a parameter ($0 \leq
m < 3$). We show that for given low values of the present matter density
parameter $\Omega_{m0}$, there is a wide range of values for $m$ for which the
lensing rate is significantly smaller than that in cosmological constant
($\Lambda$) models. We also show that models with low $\Omega_{m0}$ and
$m\stackrel{>}{\sim}2$ have high likelihood to reproduce the observed lens
statistics in the HST snapshot survey.

We investigate the formation of clusters of galaxies in an expanding universe
using a new code that regrids at a region of high density. In particular we
investigate two models for the initial conditions, both with the standard CDM
power spectrum - one has $\Omega = 1$ and the other $\Omega = 0.2$. Both
universes have $H_0 = 100 \kms\mpc^{-1}$ and $\Lambda = 0$. The level of
substructure in the final cluster can be used as a discriminant of the cosmic
density. We discuss various statistics which can be measured observationally
from clusters of galaxies, that can be used to discriminate between the two
models. We find that most of the statistics that use the clusters' member
galaxies may not be the best measures of substructure. Statistics that rely
more on X-ray maps and other observables depending more directly on the mass
distribution could be better discriminants of $\Omega$.

I present a new method of deriving the shape of the dark matter (DM) halos of
spiral galaxies. The method relies on the comparison of model predictions with
high spectral and spatial resolution HI observations of the gas layer.
  The potential arising from the {\em total} mass distribution of the galaxy is
used in the calculation of the vertical distribution of the gas. I developed a
new algorithm to calculate the force field of an arbitrary, azimuthally
symmetric, density distribution. This algorithm is used to calculate the forces
due to the radially truncated stellar disk as well as of the flaring gas layer.
  I use a simple two-parameter family of disk-halo models which have
essentially the same observed equatorial rotation curve but different vertical
forces. This mass model is composed of a stellar disk with constant M/L, and a
DM-halo with a given axial ratio. I approximate the radial force due to the
gaseous disk, and iteratively determine the vertical force due to the global
distribution of the gas.
  The thickness of the gaseous disk is sensitive to both the flattening of the
DM-halo and the self-gravity of the gas, but not to the particular choice of
disk-halo decomposition.
  I show that the determination of the thickness of the gas layer is not
restricted to edge-on galaxies, but can be measured for moderately inclined
systems as well.

It is shown that mechanical alignment of grains can be efficient for grains
rotating suprathermally, i.e. with kinetic energy substantially exceeding $k$
(the Boltzmann constant) over any temperature in the system. The paper studies
suprathermal rotation caused by H$_{2}$ formation and the alignment that takes
place due to crossover events. Gaseous bombardment in the course of a crossover
as well as both gaseous friction and poisoning of active sites are shown to
produce alignment. The first type of alignment happens due to the angular
momentum deposited by a corpuscular flux with a grain, the second is caused by
the change of the mean time back to crossover due to the interaction with a
gaseous flux. We show that the two processes act as to decrease the grain cross
section in respect to the flux and we find the Rayleigh reduction factor for
the joint action of the two processes as well as the range of applicability of
each of the processes. Our study indicates that mechanical alignment can be
more widely spread than it is generally accepted.

Recent X-ray observations have established that collisions between
subclusters of galaxies are rather common phenomena. Prompted by such
observations, we have performed N-body simulations of two equal-mass
subclusters of galaxies, which are going to merge. We first have confirmed that
only a part of kinetic energy associated with the relative motion of two
subclusters is converted to internal energy of each subcluster at the first
encounter. We performed simulations for a variety of dark-matter (DM)
distributions, and find that the time scale for washing out the double peak
structures after the first encounter strongly depends on the distribution of
the density and velocity distributions of the DM. It takes longer when the DM
is spatially extended. According to our calculation it takes more than $4 imes
10^9$yr after the first encounter until the density contour shows only a single
peak.
  To explain the high fraction of the clusters with substructures among nearby
clusters, Richstone,Loeb Turner(1992; hereafter RLT) required recent($$ $10^9
h^{-1}$yr) cluster formation. However, our results show that the timescale for
subcluster merging is still uncertain and possibly much longer than the time
scale assumed by RLT. Caution should be exercised when concluding that the
density of the universe is high by using RLT's method.

We discuss various analytical approximation methods for following the
evolution of cosmological density perturbations into the strong (i.e.
nonlinear) clustering regime. These methods can be classified into five types:
(i) simple extrapolations from linear theory, such as the high--peak model and
the lognormal model; (ii) {\em dynamical} approximations, including the
Zel'dovich approximation and its extensions; (iii) non--linear models based on
purely geometric considerations, of which the main example is the Voronoi
model; (iv) statistical solutions involving scaling arguments, such as the
hierarchical closure {\em ansatz} for BBGKY, fractal models and the
thermodynamic model of Saslaw; (v) numerical techniques based on particles
and/or hydrodynamics. We compare the results of full dynamical evolution using
particle codes and the various other approximation schemes. To put the models
we discuss into perspective, we give a brief review of the observed properties
of galaxy clustering and the statistical methods used to quantify it, such as
correlation functions, power spectra, topology and spanning trees.

Maps of the peculiar velocity field derived from distance relations are
affected by Malmquist type bias and selection effects. Because of the large
number of interdependent effects, they are in most cases difficult to treat
analytically. Monte Carlo simulations are used to understand and evaluate these
effects. In these simulations the ``true'' spatial distribution and relevant
properties of galaxies as well as selection effects and observational
uncertainties are realistically modeled. The results of the simulation can
directly be applied to correct observed peculiar velocity maps. The simulation
is used to investigate biases in samples of measured peculiar velocities by
Lynden-Bell et al. (1988), Willick (1990) and the new sample of spiral galaxies
by Haynes et al. (1993). Based on the results obtained from the application of
our method to toy models we find that the method is a useful tool to estimate
the bias induced both by inhomogeneities and selection effects. This is a
crucial step for the analysis of the Haynes \etal sample which was selected
with a redshift dependent criterion.

We have found a statistically significant (99.1 \%) excess of red ($O-E>2$)
galaxies with photographic magnitudes $E<19.5$, $O< 21$ taken from the APM Sky
Catalogue around $z \sim 1$ radiosources from the 1Jy catalogue. The amplitude,
scale and dependence on galaxy colours of the observed overdensity are
consistent with its being a result of the magnification bias caused by the weak
gravitational lensing of large scale structures at redshift $z \approx 0.2-0.4$
and are hardly explained by other causes, as obscuration by dust.

In Papers I and II, we have used a free-energy minimization approach that
stems from the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions to describe in
simple and clear physical terms the secular and dynamical instabilities as well
as the bifurcations along equilibrium sequences of rotating, self-gravitating
fluid systems. Here we investigate the secular and dynamical 3rd-harmonic
instabilities that appear first on the Jacobi sequence of incompressible zero-
vorticity ellipsoids. Poincare found a bifurcation point on the Jacobi sequence
where a 3rd-harmonic mode becomes neutral. A sequence of pear-shaped equilibria
branches off at this point but stands at higher energies. Therefore, the Jacobi
ellipsoids remain secularly and dynamically stable. Cartan found that dynamical
3rd-harmonic instability also sets in at the Jacobi-pear bifurcation. We find
that Cartan's instability leads to differentially rotating objects and not to
uniformly rotating pear-shaped equilibria. We demonstrate that the pear-shaped
sequence exists at higher energies and at higher rotation relative to the
Jacobi sequence. The Jacobi ellipsoid undergoes fission on a secular time scale
and a short-period binary is produced. The classical fission hypothesis of
binary-star formation of Poincare and Darwin is thus feasible.

Lensing in the context of rich clusters is normally quantified from small
image distortions, yielding a relative mass distribution in the limit of weak
lensing. Here we show the magnification effect of lensing can also be mapped
over a cluster, resulting in absolute mass determinations for the weak limit.
Furthermore, given both magnification and distortion measurements, the mass
distribution may be constrained in the strong regime. Methods for obtaining the
magnification using spectroscopic and/or photometric information are discussed,
for object detection within a fixed isophote or to a given flux limit.
  A map of the magnification around A1689 is constructed from the observed
depletion of background red galaxy counts.

The large-scale prints in The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies have been used to
formulate a classification scheme for the central regions of late-type
galaxies. Systems that exhibit small bright central bulges or disks (type CB)
are found to be of earlier Hubble type and of higher luminosity than galaxies
that do not contain nuclei (type NN). Galaxies containing nuclear bars, or
exhibiting central regions that are resolved into individual stars and knots,
and galaxies with semi-stellar nuclei, are seen to have characteristics that
are intermediate between those of types CB and NN. The presence or absence of a
nucleus appears to be a useful criterion for distinguishing between spiral
galaxies and Magellanic irregulars.

The properties of high latitude dust are of great interest to extragalactic
astronomers and cosmologists. It is proposed here that essentially all high
Galactic latitude interstellar dust is at a typical temperature of about 20~K
(i.e. it is warm dust) and that if any cold high latitude interstellar dust
exists, its emission at mm-wavelengths is less than 5\%\ of that from the
primary component of warm dust observed by IRAS. Thus the IRAS maps reveal the
high latitude dust of import. The crucial issue is how the emissivity of the
dust scales with wavelength. The mm-wavelength emission in this warm dust only
model is consistent with roughly a wavelength%, $\lambda$, dependent emissivity
$\epsilon(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{-1.5}$. Such a dependence has been observed
in the infrared previously. What is new here is the proposal that this extends
to the mm-wavelength region. Proceedings of Workshop on Molecules, Dust, &
Backgrounds to be published in Planetary & Space Sciences

We show that the high redshift IRAS source F10214 is highly magnified by the
gravitational field of an intervening elliptical galaxy, accounting for its
many anomalous properties. Detailed radio and near-IR images identify the IRAS
source with a symmetric arc, centered on a red object, or lensing galaxy. To
explain the observed structures, the center of the source must much more highly
magnified than its outer regions. Lensing predicts a small counterimage to the
arc, which we find adjacent to the lensing galaxy. A red component in the
observed spectrum suggests a lens redshift of unity, and the lens model yields
a mass estimate of $M(r<3kpc)\approx10^{11}{M_solar}$, consistent with an
ordinary elliptical galaxy. We present new high-resolution optical images which
show a thin arc of emission, implying an intrinsically small source ($<0.5kpc$)
which is highly magnified ($\sim20\times$). Since the optical is strongly
polarized with a Seyfert~II spectrum, we propose that the optical arc is
magnified image of the inner region of an obscured AGN. The obscuring ``torus''
will be similarly magnified, naturally accounting for the large IR flux. We
show that finding objects like F10214+4724 in redshift surveys is probable,
given the level of magnification bias expected for compact luminous IRAS
sources. Such cases represent the obscured AGN counterparts to the lensed QSO
population and, because of their extended sizes, are useful in determining the
mass distribution in the lensing galaxies.

Binary galaxies are modeled as point-masses obeying the non-Newtonian MOND
and Mannheim-Kazanas (MKG) theories of gravity. Random samples of such systems
are generated by means of Monte Carlo simulations of binary orbits. Model pairs
have total masses and mass ratios similar to pairs in the cataloged sample used
in the analysis. General features of synthetic samples are derived from a
comparison with observed data of galaxy pairs in $R \times \Delta
V/(L_1+L_2)^{1/2} $ space. Both MOND and Mannheim-Kazanas binaries either on
circular or low-eccentricity orbits cannot be the source of observations
because they require extremely high $M/L$ values ($\approx$ 45 solar units).
Both MOND and MKG binaries on high-eccentricity orbits and reasonable $M/L$
values (5 solar units) produce envelopes of $R \times \Delta V/(L_1+L_2)^{1/2}$
consistent with the observations, but the distribution of separations is
inconsistent with the observed data, unless strong selection effects are at
work. A definite answer to the issue whether one or another model is suitable
to explain real binary galaxy dynamics will be only possible when {\it a large
sample containing a significant fraction of wide pairs, determined with
velocity-blind selection procedures, is investigated} under a rigorous
statistical analysis, taking into account sample selection biases and
contamination by non-physical pairs.

Fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background have now
been detected over a wide range of angular scales, and a consistent picture
seems to be emerging. This article describes some of the implications for
cosmology. Analysis of all the published detections suggests the existence of a
peak on degree scales of height 2.4 to 10 (90%CL) relative to the amplitude of
the power spectrum at large angular scales. This result confirms an early
prediction, implies that the universe did in fact recombine, and limits
theories of structure formation. Illustrative examples are provided of how the
comparison of microwave background and large-scale structure data will be a
potentially powerful means of answering fundamental questions about the
universe.

If the dark halo of our galaxy is made of compact objects as massive as M =
10^6 solar masses, their detection by means of ordinary microlensing searches
would take a very long time as the characteristic time scale of such a lensing
event, t_0, is approximately 200 years. Fortunately, the very high
magnification events of the numerous faint stars, which are normally well below
the detection threshold, have short duration peaks with a characteristic time
scale of only t_0 / A_{max}, where A_{max} >> 1 is the peak magnification
factor. The two almost equally bright images are separated by approximately 2''
(M/10^6 solar masses )^{1/2}, and they rotate very rapidly around the lens with
the relative proper motion enhanced by a factor 2 A_{max}. The same events will
offer an opportunity to study spectroscopically stars which are normally far
too faint to be reached.

We discuss the probability distributions of Fourier modes of cosmological
density fields using the central limit theorem as it applies to weighted
integrals of random fields. It is shown that if the cosmological principle
holds in a certain sense, i.e., the universe approaches homogeneity and
isotropy sufficiently rapidly on very large scales, the one-point distribution
of each Fourier mode of the density field is Gaussian whether or not the
density field itself is Gaussian. Therefore, one-point distributions of the
power spectrum obtained from observational data or from simulations are not a
good test of whether the density field is Gaussian.

We present direct evidence of a collision of subclusters in the galaxy
cluster Abell 754. Our comparison of new optical data and archival ROSAT PSPC
X-ray data reveal three collision signatures predicted by n-body/hydrodynamical
simulations of hierarchical cluster evolution. First, there is strong evidence
of a non-hydrostatic process; neither of the two major clumps in the galaxy
distribution lies on the off-center peak of the X-ray emission from the
intracluster gas. Second, the peak of the X-ray emission is elongated
perpendicular to the collision axis defined by the centroids of the two galaxy
clumps. Third, there is evidence of compression-heated gas; one of A754's two
X-ray temperature components (Henry & Briel 1995) is among the hottest observed
in any cluster and hotter than that inferred from the velocity dispersion of
the associated galaxy clump. These signatures are consistent with the
qualitative features of simulations (Evrard 1990a,b) in which two subclusters
have collided in the plane of the sky during roughly the last Gyr. The
detection of such collisions is crucial for understanding both the dynamics of
individual clusters and the underlying cosmology. First, for systems like A754,
estimating the cluster X-ray mass from assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium
and isothermality is incorrect and may produce the discrepancies sometimes
found between X-ray masses and those derived from gravitational lens models
(Babul & Miralda-Escude 1994). Second, the fraction of nearby clusters in which
subclusters have collided in the last Gyr is especially sensitive to the mean
mass density parameter Omega_0 (cf. Richstone et al. 1992; Evrard et al. 1993;
Lacey & Cole 1993). With a large, well-defined cluster sample, it will be
possible to place a new and powerful constraint on cosmological models.

Two spacecraft separated by $\sim 1\,\au$ and equipped with gamma-ray burst
(GRB) detectors could detect or rule out a cosmological density of Massive
Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) in the mass range $10^{-15} M_{\odot}\lsim M
\lsim 10^{-7} M_{\odot}$ provided that GRBs prove to be cosmological.
Previously devised methods for detecting MACHOs have spanned the mass range
$10^{-16} M_{\odot}\lsim M \lsim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, but with a gap of several
orders of magnitude near $10^{-9} M_{\odot}$. For MACHOs and sources both at a
cosmological distance, the Einstein radius is $\sim 1\,\au\,(M/10^{-7}
M_\odot)^{1/2}$. Hence, if a GRB lies within the Einstein ring of a MACHO of
mass $M\lsim 10^{-7}M_\odot$ as seen by one detector, it will not lie in the
Einstein ring as seen by a second detector $\sim 1\,\au$ away. This implies
that if GRBs are measured to have significantly different fluxes by the two
detectors, this would signal the presence of a MACHO $\lsim 10^{-7}M_\odot$. By
the same token, if the two detectors measured similar fluxes for several
hundred events a cosmological abundance of such low-mass MACHOs would be ruled
out. The lower limit of sensitivity, $M\lsim 10^{-15}M_\odot$ is set by the
finite size of the source. If low-mass MACHOs are detected, there are tests
which can discriminate among events generated by MACHOs in the three mass
ranges $M\lsim 10^{-12}\,M_\odot$, $10^{-12}\,M_\odot\lsim M\lsim
10^{-7}\,M_\odot$, and $M\gsim 10^{-7}\ M_\odot$. Further experiments would
then be required to make more accurate mass measurements.

Most studies of correlations between X-ray and optical properties of galaxy
clusters have used the largest samples of data available, regardless of the
morphological types of clusters included. Given the increasing evidence that
morphology is related to a cluster's degree of dynamical evolution, we approach
the study of X-ray and optical correlations differently. We evaluate the
relationship between velocity dispersion and temperature for a limited set of
galaxy clusters taken from Bird (1994), which all possess dominant central
galaxies and which have been explicitly corrected for the presence of
substructure. We find that $\sigma _r \propto T^{0.61 \pm 0.13}$. We use a
Monte Carlo computer routine to estimate the significance of this deviation
from the $\sigma _r \propto T^{0.5}$ relationship predicted by the virial
theorem. We find that the simulated correlation is steeper than the observed
value only 4\% of the time, suggesting that the deviation is significant. The
combination of protogalactic winds and dynamical friction reproduces nearly
exactly the observed relationship between $\sigma _r$ and $T$.

We demonstrate, using a simple analytic model, that the presence of a massive
satellite can globally modify the structure and emission properties of an
accretion disc to which it is tidally coupled. We show, using two levels of
numerical approximation, that the analytic model gives reasonable results. The
results are applicable to two astrophysical situations. In the case of an
active galactic nucleus, we consider the case of a $\sim 10^3\Msun$ compact
companion to the central black-hole and show that it could modulate the emitted
spectrum on a timescale of $\sim10^5$ years. In the case of a T Tauri accretion
disc, a satellite such as a sub-dwarf or giant planet could modify the disc
spectral energy distribution over a substantial fraction of the T Tauri star
lifetime.

We explore the feasibility of resurrecting the apparent magnitude-redshift
relation for a ``standard candle'' to measure the cosmological constant and
mass density. We show that type Ia supernovae, if measured with 0.15 mag
uncertainty out to a redshift of z=1, may provide a good standard candle or
calibrated candle for this purpose. The recent discovery of probable type Ia
supernovae in the redshift range z=0.3 to 0.5 (Perlmutter 1994a, and 1994b)
indicates that the flux of optical photons from these events can be measured
this accurately. The 7 distant supernovae discovered to date do not by
themselves distinguish between different cosmological models, however the
further discovery of about 50 type Ia supernovae at redshifts in the range $0.5
\leq z \leq 1.0 $ could strongly constrain the allowed range of these
parameters. We estimate that the follow-up photometry necessary for this
measurement would be on the order of 20 - 70 hours of time on a 10-meter class
telescope at a site with good seeing.

We have begun a program to discover high-redshift supernovae ($z \approx$
0.25--0.5), and study them with follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. We
report here our first discovery, a supernova at $z = 0.458$. The photometry for
this supernova closely matches the lightcurve calculated for this redshift from
the template of well-observed nearby Type Ia supernovae. We discuss the
measurement of the deceleration parameter $q_0$ using such high-redshift
supernovae, and give the best fit value assuming this one supernova is a
normal, unextincted Type Ia. We describe the main sources of error in such a
measurement of $q_0$, and ways to reduce these errors.

Photometric measurements show that as a group nearby type Ia supernovae
follow similar lightcurves and reach similar peak magnitudes Thus, these
supernovae can serve as standard candles or calibrated candles at cosmological
distances. Magnitudes of local and distant supernovae, both in the same filter
band, are compared using a $K$ correction to account for the different spectral
regions incident on that filter. A generalized approach compares magnitudes in
different bands for the nearby and distant supernova, bands that are selected
to give sensitivity in corresponding regions of the redshifted and unredshifted
spectra. Thus at a redshift of $z \approx 0.5$, local $B$ magnitudes are
compared with distant $R$ magnitudes. We compute these generalized $K$
corrections over a range of redshifts and bandpass pairs and discuss their
advantages over the traditional single-band $K$ correction. In particular,
errors near maximum light can be kept below 0.05 mag out to at least $z=0.6$,
whereas the traditional $K$ correction is difficult to use beyond $z > 0.2$.

Calculation of gravitational radiation during binary inspiral leading to
possible formation of a Thorne-Zytkow (TZ) object (a neutron star inside a
supergiant core) is performed. The calculations were done for polytropic
density distributions with different indeces $n$, as well as for realistic
models of supergiants. A maximum frequency of the emitted gravitational waves
during this process was found to range from a few to 300 initial keplerian
orbital frequensies, that is from $10^{-5}$ to $\sim 0.1$ Hz, depending on the
model. A dimensionless strain metric amplitude can reach $h\sim 10^{-23.5}$ for
a source lying 10 kpc away from the Sun. We conclude that TZ objects forming at
a rate of 1 per 500 yrs in the Galaxy could be potential astrophysical targets
for space laser intereferometers. Analysis of gravitational waveforms emitted
during TZ-object formation could bring a unique information about stellar
structure.

We explore a series expansion method to calculate the modes of oscillations
for a variety of uniformly rotating finite disks, either with or without a dark
halo. Since all models have the same potential, this survey focuses on the role
of the distribution function in stability analyses. We show that the stability
behaviour is greatly influenced by the structure of the unperturbed
distribution, particularly by its energy dependence. In addition we find that
uniformly rotating disks with a halo in general can feature spiral-like
instabilities.

We present a formalism well adapted to the numerical study of the encounter
of an ordinary main sequence star with a massive black hole. Symmetry
considerations, the use of a well adapted moving grid and a well adapted moving
frame along with integration of the partial differential equations by means of
pseudo-spectral methods result in a very powerful and accurate tool. The
hydrodynamical equations are written in a moving frame which mimics the bulk of
the movement of the fluid, resulting in very small relative velocities and a
well suited spatial resolution throughout the calculations. Therefore, the
numerical calculations are considerably simplified, smoothing in particular the
Courant condition. Typical runs are performed within a few hours on a
workstation with the high accuracy linked to the spectral methods. Predictions
of the so-called affine are tested against this full numerical simulation.

Massive stars in their final stages of collapse radiate most of their binding
energy in the form of MeV neutrinos. The recoil atoms that they produce in
elastic scattering off nuclei in organic tissue create radiation damage which
is highly effective in the production of irreparable DNA harm, leading to
cellular mutation, neoplasia and oncogenesis. Using a conventional model of the
galaxy and of the collapse mechanism, the periodicity of nearby stellar
collapses and the radiation dose are calculated. The possible contribution of
this process to the paleontological record of mass extinctions is examined.

Warm dark matter (WDM) is an intriguing model of structure formation from the
point of view of both cosmology and particle physics. We consider a
one-parameter family of WDM models. The linear power spectra for these models
is calculated and compared with the corresponding spectra for cold dark matter
(CDM), hot dark matter (HDM) and mixed dark matter (MDM) as well as the power
spectrum derived from observations. Our linear analyses suggest that a model
universe dominated by a particle whose mass to temperature ratio $m_x/T_x$ is
increased by a factor of two as compared with the standard HDM neutrino gives a
reasonable fit to the data on large $(>8h^{-1} {\rm ~Mpc})$ scales. $N$-body
simulations for this particular WDM model show features of both HDM and CDM. As
in HDM, the first objects to collapse are large pancake-like structures. The
final matter distribution is rather smooth and structures as small as galaxy
halos are excluded. However, there appear to be virialized rich clusters
evident in the CDM but not the HDM simulations. Unfortunately, a simple
comparison of the matter distribution and its statistical properties with
observations indicates that WDM, like CDM, has too much power at small scales.
This is particularly evident in the small-scale pairwize velocity dispersion.
The cluster multiplicity function has the wrong shape with too many rich
clusters being produced, though this conclusion is based on the simple
assumption that light traces mass in groups of galaxies.

Fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature are being
studied with ever increasing precision. Two competing types of theories might
describe the origins of these fluctuations: ``inflation'' and ``defects''. Here
we show how the differences between these two scenarios can give rise to
striking signatures in the microwave fluctuations on small scales, assuming a
standard recombination history. These should enable high resolution
measurements of CMB anisotropies to distinguish between these two broad classes
of theories, independent of the precise details of each.

We present a model to explain the decrease in the amplitude of the pulse
profile with increasing energy observed in Geminga's soft X-ray surface thermal
emission. We assume the presence of plates surrounded by a surface with very
distinct physical properties: these two regions emit spectra of very distinct
shapes which present a crossover, the warm plates emitting a softer spectrum
than the colder surrounding surface. The strongly pulsed emission from the
plates dominates at low energy while the surroundings emission dominates at
high energy, producing naturally a strong decrease in the pulsed fraction. In
our illustrative example the plates are assumed to be magnetized while the rest
of the surface is field free.
  This plate structure may be seen as a schematic representation of a
continuous but very nonuniform distribution of the surface magnetic field or as
a quasi realistic structure induced by past tectonic activity on Geminga.

We present a novel technique for calculating the two-point autocorrelation
function of the Lyman-alpha forest based on the relation between the two-point
correlation function and the Neighbor Probability Distribution Functions. The
technique appears to reduce the scatter in estimates of the correlation
function by a factor of about two from the traditional pair-counting method. We
apply the technique to the Lyman-alpha forest line lists determined from the
spectra of seven z > 2 QSOs observed at high resolution ( < 25 km/s ). Of
these, only two spectra, those of Q0055-259 and Q0014+813, appear to be
sufficiently free of systematics to obtain meaningful estimates of the
correlation function. We find positive correlations, with a maximum amplitude
of 0.5 - 1, on the scale of 0.5 - 3 h^{-1} Mpc (comoving), or 100 - 600 km/s,
in the forests of both QSOs. The technique also finds strong evidence for
anticorrelation on the scale of 3 - 6 h^{-1} Mpc. The strength of the positive
correlations is comparable to that predicted from the primordial power spectrum
inferred from optically-selected galaxy redshift surveys. If the
anticorrelations are physical, it becomes unclear whether the detected
clustering is consistent with current models of structure formation with a
homogeneous photoionizing UV metagalactic background. Instead, the
anti-clustering may require inhomogeneity in the UV background, and possibly in
the process of reionization itself.

Paramagnetic alignment of non-spherical dust grains rotating at thermal
velocities is studied. The analytical solution is found for the alignment
measure of oblate grains. Perturbative approach is used for solving the
problem. It is shown that even the first approximation of the suggested
iteration procedure provides the accuracy well within one percent of the
expected measure of alignment. The results obtained are applicable both to
paramagnetic and to superferromagnetic grains.

We present a method to compute the probability distribution function of the
(true) Hubble constant and the age of the universe, given the estimate of the
Hubble constant in our nearby galaxy samples. Our method takes into account
both the observational errors and the cosmic variance, and enables to
quantitatively compute the constraints on the cosmological models. Based on the
present local observation $H_0=80\pm17$ km/s/Mpc, the probability of $H_0<50$
km/s/Mpc is about 6\% for the Einstein -- de Sitter universe ($\Omega_0=1$) and
4\% for an open ($\Omega_0=0.2$) universe. These probabilities are reduced to
0.8\% and 0.03\%, respectively, if the accuracy of the observational
uncertainty is improved within 10\%. Similar probabilistic constraints on $t_0$
are also discussed.

We study the formation of O I and OH spectral lines in three-dimensional
hydrodynamic models of the solar photosphere. The line source function of the O
I 777 nm triplet is allowed to depart from local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE), within the two-level-atom approximation. Comparison with results from 1D
models show that the 3D models alleviate, but do not remove, the discrepancy
between the oxygen abundances reported from non-LTE work on the 777 nm triplet
and from the [O I] 630 nm and OH lines. Results for the latter two could imply
that the solar oxygen abundance is below 8.8 (lg(H) = 12). If this is
confirmed, the discrepancy between theory and observation for the 777 nm
triplet lines might fall within the range of errors in equivalent width
measurements and f-values. The line source function of the 777 nm triplet in
the 1.5D approximation is shown to differ insignificantly from the full 3D
non-LTE result.

We study the implications of a recent estimate of the bulk flow of a sample
of galaxies containing supernovae type Ia by Riess, Press, and Kirshner. We
find that their results are quite consistent with power spectra from several
currently popular models of structure formation, but that the sample is as yet
too sparse to put significant constraints on the power spectrum. We compare
this new result with that of Lauer and Postman, with which there is apparent
disagreement. We find that for the power spectra we consider, the difference in
window functions between the two samples used for the measurements results in a
low level of expected correlation between the estimated bulk flows. We
calculate a $\chi^2$ for the two measurements taken together and find that
their lack of agreement tends to disfavor spectra with excessive power on large
scales, but not at a level sufficient to rule them out. A sample consisting of
other SN type Ia's found in the Asiago catalog is used to study how the
sensitivity of the method used by RPK will improve with increasing sample size.
We conclude that the local group motion should be able to be determined with a
sample of $\sim 100$ SN Ia light curve shapes.

We have identified 4 Cepheids and 5 Miras using KPNO 4m BVRI images of an
outer field in M101. The Cepheid and Mira periods range from 30 to 60 days and
350 to 800 days, respectively. We derive independent Cepheid and Mira distance
moduli that agree within experimental uncertainties. We find a true distance
modulus of 29.08 +- 0.13 mag.

The spin-induced quadrupole moment of a rapidly rotating star changes the
orbital dynamics in a binary system, giving rise to advance (or regression) of
periastron and precession of the orbital plane. We show that these effects are
important in the recently discovered radio pulsar/main sequence star binary
system PSR J0045$-$7319, and can reliably account for the observed peculiar
timing residuals. Precise measurements of the apsidal motion and orbital plane
precession can yield valuable information on the internal structure and
rotation of the star. The detection of orbital precession implies that the spin
of the companion star is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and
suggests that the supernova gave the pulsar a kick out of the original orbital
plane. Tidal excitation of g-mode oscillations in the PSR J0045$-$7319 system
induces an orbital period change of order $|\Delta P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm orb}|\sim
10^{-6}$ at each periastron passage, but the secular trend depends on the
radiative damping time of the g-modes. We also discuss the spin-orbit coupling
effects for the accreting X-ray pulsars and the other known radio pulsar/main
sequence binary, PSR B1259$-$63.

As the data on CMB anisotropies improve and potential cosmological
applications are realized, it will be increasingly important for theoretical
calculations to be as accurate as possible. All modern calculations for
inflationary-inspired fluctuations involve the numerical solution of coupled
Boltzmann equations. There are many assumptions and choices to be made when
carrying out such calculations. We go through each in turn, pointing out the
best selections to make, and the level of inaccuracy expected through incorrect
choice: (1) neglecting the effects of neutrinos or polarization has a 10%
effect; (2) varying radiation temperature and He fraction can have smaller, but
noticeable effects; (3) numerical issues, such as k-range and smoothing are
discussed; (4) short-cut methods, e.g. free-streaming and tilt approximations,
are generally inadequate at the few % level; (5) at the 1% level somewhat
baroque effects are important, such as He recombination and even minimal
reionization; (6) at smaller angular scales there are secondary effects which
will ultimately have to be considered. Extracting information from the
subsidiary acoustic peaks and the damping region will be an extremely
challenging problem. However, given the prospect of measuring just such
information on the sky, it will be important to meet this challenge. In
principle we can obtain details about reionization history, neutrino
contribution, helium abundance, non-power-law initial conditions etc.

Binary radio pulsars are superb tools for mapping binary orbits, because of
the precision of the pulse timing method (Taylor and Weisberg 1989). To date,
all orbital parameters for binary pulsars have been derived from observations
of the pulsar alone. We present the first observations of the radial velocity
variations due to the binary motion of a companion to a radio pulsar. Our
results demonstrate that the companion to the Small Magellanic Cloud pulsar PSR
J0045-7319 is the B1V star identified by Kaspi et al. (1994). The mass ratio of
the system is 6.3 +/- 1.2, which, for a neutron star mass of 1.4 Mo, implies a
mass of 8.8 +/- 1.8 Mo for the companion, consistent with the mass expected for
a B1V star. The inclination angle for the binary system is therefore 44 +/- 5
degrees, and the projected rotational velocity of the companion is 113 +/- 10
km/s. The heliocentric radial velocity of the binary system is consistent with
that of other stars and gas in the same region of the Small Magellanic Cloud.

We discuss a model for the central region of radio-quiet AGN in which coronal
accretion is the source of energy for X-ray emission. We start from the Haardt
& Maraschi model but supplement it with pressure balance condition, two
possibilities of the angular momentum transfer and three models of the
disc-corona transition. We employ the alpha-description of viscosity within the
two layers. Both descriptions of the angular momentum transport lead to similar
conclusions about the fraction of energy liberated in the disc although they
predict strongly different properties of the disc interiors. The coupled
disc/corona system has one family of solutions at low accretion rates, two
families of solutions at intermediate accretion rates and no solution for high
accretion rate. Of the two families of solutions, the first one has weakly
dissipating coronae and the second one has coronae which dominate energetically
the system. The two solutions merge at sub-Eddington accretion rate because a
corona in hydrostatic equilibrium can dissipate only a limited amount of
energy, which depends on the viscosity parameter.

We report on the optical recovery of SN~1986E 7.1 and 7.9 years after
explosion. The spectra are dominated by broad H$\alpha$ and [O~I]
$\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 emission lines with a minor contribution from [Ca~II]
$\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 and, possibly, [Fe~II] $\lambda$7155. Compared with
the spectra of the other recovered SNII, SN1986E shows strong H$\alpha$
luminosity similar to SN~1979C but, in contrast, weak [O~III] emission. So far,
among classified SNe, only type II Linears have been recovered a few years past
the explosion. The high optical luminosity of Linear SNII at this phase is most
likely related to the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar wind
which is also expected to produce strong radio emission. Therefore radio
observations of the remnant of SN~1986E are worth attempting. The circumstellar
interaction model predicts that, in the next decade, the strength of the
[O~III]/H$\alpha$ emission rapidly increases and [O~III]
$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 should eventually dominate the spectrum. We observed
this effect in SN~1957D 30 years after explosion which therefore may represent
the normal evolution of SNII with a dense circumstellar medium. The details
observed in the spectra of both SNe suggest directions for further refinement
of the modelling.

We report the discovery of emission from Wolf-Rayet stars in a giant HII
region 4.5 arcsec South of the nucleus of the IRAS barred spiral galaxy Mrk
712. The ratio of WNL to OV stars, estimated from the luminosity of the HeII
4686 line, is 0.2. By comparison with starburst and stellar evolution models,
we find that this high value is only compatible with a very young starburst
episode (3 - 4 Myr) and a flat initial mass function (Gamma = -1). The presence
of the [ArV] line reveals that the HII region is strongly ionized by the hot
Wolf-Rayet stars. The comparison with other barred Wolf-Rayet galaxies suggests
that the detection of Wolf-Rayet stars depends on the dust content and
orientation of the galaxy.

Based on an R-band imaging survey of 6 high redshift (z~2) and high
luminosity (M<-28mag) QSOs, we report the detection of extensions in two
radio-quiet and one radio-loud QSO. The extensions are most likely due to the
host galaxies of these QSOs, with luminosities of at least 3-7 per cent of the
QSO luminosity. The most likely values for the luminosity of the host galaxies
lie in the range $6-18 per cent of the QSO luminosity.

The one-point probability distribution function (pdf) is computed for the
$25\hmpc$-smoothed density field of rich clusters of galaxies in the
Abell/\aco\ catalogs. The observed pdf is compared to the pdf s drawn similarly
from mock catalogs of clusters in cosmological simulations of Gaussian and
several non-Gaussian initial conditions. Several statistics allow significant
rejection of the non-Gaussian models tested here, and fail to reject the
Gaussian model. A comparison with the predictions of second-order perturbation
theory and a log-normal model for cdm Gaussian initial conditions yield a
linear biasing factor $b_c/b_o \simeq 4$ and $b_c/b_o\simeq 3.7$ for $R\geq 0$
clusters.

We present simulations of the cluster distribution in several dark matter
models, using an optimized version of the truncated Zel'dovich approximation
(TZA). We compare them with N-body cluster simulations and find that the TZA
provides a very accurate description of the cluster distribution as long as
fluctuations on the cluster mass scale are in the mildly non-linear regime. The
simulated dark matter models are: Standard CDM (SCDM), Tilted CDM (TCDM) with
n=0.7, Cold+Hot DM (CHDM) with 30% of hot component, low Hubble constant
(h=0.3) CDM (LOWH) and a spatially flat low-density CDM model with
\Omega_0=0.2. We compare the simulations with a redshift sample of Abell/ACO
clusters, using the integral of the 2-point correlation function and the
probability density function. We find that the best models at reproducing the
data are CHDM and LCDM. All the other models are ruled out. The reduced
skewness S_3 is fairly constant with S_3=1.9, independent of the DM model and
consistent with observational data. The abundances of clusters predicted using
the Press--Schechter theory provide strong constraints: only the CHDM, LOWH and
LCDM models appear to produce the correct number-density of clusters.

We present here the solution for accretion disk structure, which describes
continuously the transition between optically thick and optically thin disk
regions. We show that the disk structure equations without advection, used
here, give two branches of solutions which do not intersect for
$L<L_{b}\lesssim 0.6 L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\alpha=1.0$ and $M_{BH}=10^8 M_\odot$.
For larger luminosities there are no global solutions of the equations without
advection. We suggest, as one of the possibilities, that advection becomes
important even before, at luminosities $\sim0.1L_{\rm Edd}$, when the inner
disk regions become unstable due to radiation pressure dominance and induce the
transition from optically thick to optically thin disk in the global solution.

A ROSAT HRI image of the hyperluminous infrared galaxy IRAS P09104+4109 shows
extended X-ray emission peaked around the central galaxy in a profile
characteristic of a cooling flow. The inferred soft X-ray luminosity is
comparable to that detected with ASCA. The ASCA spectrum is well fit by a
cooling flow spectrum, indicating a mass cooling rate of about 1000 Msunpyr.
The cooling flow dominates the total luminosity of the surrounding cluster. Any
contribution from a hidden AGN in the host galaxy to either the total ASCA
spectrum or the HRI image is small.

We have developed a parameter-independent method to detect local maxima of
the two-point correlation function. By applying it to two samples of rich Abell
clusters of galaxies with redshift limits z<0.08 and z<0.12 we detect three
maxima centered at 150 Mpc, 300 Mpc and 430 Mpc with confidence levels 80% and
higher. This sequence of fluctuations has an average interval of 140 Mpc, that
can be explained by a power spectrum with a distinct peak at
k=0.048+-0.005/Mpc.

Using adaptive optics at the ESO 3.6m telescope, we obtained diffraction
limited JHK-images of the region around the Herbig AeBe star NX Pup. We clearly
resolved the close companion (sep. 0.128") to NX Pup -- originally discovered
by HST -- and measured its JHK magnitudes. A third object at a separation of
7.0" from NX Pup was identified as a classical T Tauri star so that NX Pup may
in fact form a hierarchical triple system. We discuss the evolutionary status
of these stars and derive estimates for their spectral types, luminosities,
masses and ages.

I discuss observations of magnitude residuals from the B-band Tully-Fisher
relationship, B-V color, chemical abundance gradients, and asymmetries in the H
I and stellar disks of nearby spiral galaxies within the context of a model in
which small satellites or H I clouds are accreted onto the outer disks of
spiral galaxies. Correlations between the various observables support the
hypothesis that accretion dilutes the gas phase abundances in the outer disk,
steepens the abundance gradient across the disk, increases the star formation
rate, and creates asymmetries in the outer disk. By estimating the duration of
steep abundance gradients, elevated rates of star formation, or outer disk
asymmetries, constraints can be placed on the rate of accretion events. The
data suggest that accretion events at the current time are common.

Until very recently the physical mechanism driving oscillations in
$\beta$~Cep and other early type stars has been a mystery. The breakthrough
came with the publication of new OPAL and OP opacity data. Model calculations
with the new opacities have demonstrated that the pulsations are driven by the
familiar $\kappa$-mechanism, acting in the metal opacity bump at $T \approx 2
\times 10^5$K. The mechanism excites the low order $p$- and $g$-modes in the
upper part of the instability strip and the high order $g$-modes in the lower
part of the strip. The theoretical instability domains agree well with the
observed domains of the $\beta$~Cep and the SPB stars. In this review I present
these recent theoretical results and discuss their consequences for our
understanding of B stars pulsations.

We explore the Gnedin-Ostriker suggestion that a post-Big-Bang
photodissociation process may modify the primordial abundances of the light
elements. We consider several specific models and discuss the general features
that are necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) to make the model work. We
find that with any significant processing, the final D and $^3$He abundances,
which are independent of their initial standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN)
values, rise quickly to a level several orders of magnitude above the
observationally inferred primordial values. Solutions for specific models show
that the only initial abundances that can be photoprocessed into agreement with
observations are those that undergo virtually no processing and are already in
agreement with observation. Thus it is unlikely that this model can work for
any non-trivial case unless an artificial density and/or photon distribution is
invoked.

We explore the cosmological implications of an ultra-light
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. With global spontaneous symmetry breaking scale
$f \simeq 10^{18}$ GeV and explicit breaking scale comparable to MSW neutrino
masses, $M \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, such a field, which acquires a mass $m_\phi \sim
M^2/f \sim H_0$, would have become dynamical at recent epochs and currently
dominate the energy density of the universe. The field acts as an effective
cosmological constant for several expansion times and then relaxes into a
condensate of coherent non-relativistic bosons. Such a model can reconcile
dynamical estimates of the density parameter, $\Omega_m \sim 0.2$, with a
spatially flat universe, and can yield an expansion age $H_0 t_0 \simeq 1$
while remaining consistent with limits from gravitational lens statistics.

We present synthetic images of disks around T Tauri stars. We calculate
visibility curves in order to study the possibility of directly detecting
thermal emission from T Tauri disks. Total fluxes of T Tauri disks are compared
to the sensitivity of VISA, the interferometric sub-array of the European Very
Large Telescope. We conclude that thermal emission from circumstellar disk
around T Tauri stars is detectable with current or soon-to-be interferometric
techniques at wavelengths longer than 2.2 microns.

Optical surveys for galaxies are biased against the inclusion of low surface
brightness (LSB) galaxies. Disney (1976) suggested that the constancy of disk
central surface brightness noticed by Freeman (1970) was not a physical result,
but instead was an artifact of sample selection. Since LSB galaxies do exist,
the pertinent and still controversial issue is if these newly discovered
galaxies constitute a significant percentage of the general galaxy population.
In this paper, we address this issue by determining the space density of
galaxies as a function of disk central surface brightness. Using the physically
reasonable assumption (which is motivated by the data) that central surface
brightness is independent of disk scale length, we arrive at a distribution
which is roughly flat (i.e. approximately equal numbers of galaxies at each
surface brightness) faintwards of the Freeman (1970) value. Brightwards of
this, we find a sharp decline in the distribution which is analogous to the
turn down in the luminosity function at $L^*$. An intrinsically sharply peaked
``Freeman Law'' distribution can be completely ruled out, and no Gaussian
distribution can fit the data. Low surface brightness galaxies (those with
central surface brightnesses fainter than $22~B\sb$) comprise $\gtrsim 1/2$ the
general galaxy population, so a representative sample of galaxies at $z = 0$
does not really exist at present since past surveys have been insensitive to
this component of the general galaxy population.

We present CCD phase-binned light curves at 490 nm for 97 Cepheid variable
stars in the bar of the LMC. The photometry was obtained as part of the French
EROS project and has excellent phase coverage, permitting accurate
decomposition into Fourier components. We identify as `sinusoidal' or
s-Cepheids those stars with periods less than 5.5 d and small second-harmonic
components. These stars comprise $\sim$30% of our sample and most form a
sequence $\sim$1 mag brighter than the LMC classical Cepheids in the
period-luminosity diagram. They are also generally bluer and have
lower-amplitude light curves. We infer that the s-Cepheids are first-overtone
pulsators because, when their periods are converted to expected
fundamental-mode values, they obey a common period-luminosity-colour relation
with classical Cepheids. This also confirms the reality of the colour term in
the Cepheid period-luminosity-colour relation. Further, the blue edge of the
classical Cepheid instability strip agrees well with the theoretical
calculations for the fundamental mode made by Chiosi et al. (1993) for the
Hertzsprung-Russell and period-luminosity diagrams, but we find that our
observed s-Cepheids are $>0.2$ mag brighter and bluer than the Chiosi et al.\
predictions for the first-overtone. We identify a number of features in plots
of our stars' Fourier-component amplitude ratios and phase differences. These
features have been identified with resonances between different pulsation
modes. In the LMC we find these features seem to occur at periods very similar
to Galactic ones for classical Cepheids, but at different periods for
s-Cepheids. We discover a double-mode Cepheid in the LMC, for which $P({\rm
first overtone})/P({\rm fundamental}) = 0.710 \pm 0.001$, very similar to
observed ratios for Galactic double-mode Cepheids.

Comparing the observed peculiar velocities of the Local Group and of nearby
Abell clusters of galaxies with those predicted using linear perturbation
theory and the 3-D reconstruction algorithm of Branchini \& Plionis (1995) the
value of $\beta$ can be estimated. I show that the anisotropy that causes the
LG motion does not only extend to very large depths ($\sim 160 \; h^{-1}$ Mpc)
but it is also very coherent, which suggests that the value of $\beta \approx
0.21 \pm 0.015$, obtained from the LG velocity, should not be significantly
affected by cosmic variance. Comparing the Abell cluster and QDOT galaxy
dipoles in real space their relative biasing factor are estimated to be
$b_{cI}\approx 3.5\pm0.5$. Finally, using a suitable set of available cluster
peculiar velocities I obtain a somewhat lower value of $\beta\approx 0.15 -
0.17$ but with a large uncertainty ($\gtrsim 0.1$) when weighted by the large
observational errors.

A 12C32S, 13C32S, 12C34S, and 12C33S J = 2 - 1 line survey has been made to
study interstellar 32S/34S and 34S/33S ratios from the galactic disk. The four
CS isotopomers were detected in 20 star forming regions with galactocentric
distances between 3 and 9 kpc. From a comparison of line velocities, the C33S J
= 2 - 1 rest frequency is about 250 kHz below the value given in the Lovas
(1992) catalog. Taking 12C/13C ratios from Wilson & Rood (1994) and assuming
equal 12C32S and 13C32S excitation temperatures and beam filling factors,
12C32S opacities are in the range 3 to 15; average 32S/34S and 34S/33S isotope
ratios are 24.4 +/- 5.0 and 6.27 +/- 1.01, respectively. While no systematic
variation in the 34S/33S isotope ratio is found, the 32S/34S ratio increases
with galactocentric distance when accounting for the 12C/13C gradient of the
galactic disk. A fit to the unweighted data yields 32S/34S = 3.3 +/- 0.5
(dGC/kpc) + 4.1 +/- 3.1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. Since the
interstellar sulfur (S) isotopes are synthesized by oxygen burning in massive
stars, consequences for nucleosynthesis and models of chemical evolution are
briefly discussed.

We use the Jaffe model as a global mass distribution for the Galaxy and
determine the circular velocity $v_c$ and the Jaffe radius $r_j$ using the
satellites of the Galaxy, estimates of the local escape velocity of stars, the
constraints imposed by the known rotation curve of the disk, and the Local
Group timing model. The models include the systematic uncertainties in the
isotropy of the satellite orbits, the form of the stellar distribution function
near the escape velocity, and the ellipticity of the M31/Galaxy orbit. If we
include the Local Group timing constraint, then Leo I is bound,
$v_c=230\pm30\kms$, and $r_j=180$ kpc (110 kpc $\ltorder r_j \ltorder $ 300
kpc) at 90\% confidence. The satellite orbits are nearly isotropic with
$\beta=1-\sigma_\theta^2/\sigma_r^2=0.07$ ($-0.7 \ltorder \beta \ltorder 0.6$)
and the stellar distribution function near the escape velocity is
$f(\epsilon)\propto \epsilon^k$ with $k_r=3.7$ ($0.8 \ltorder k_r \ltorder
7.6$) where $k_r=k+5/2$. While not an accurate measurement of $k$, it is
consistent with models of violent relaxation ($k=3/2$). The mass inside 50 kpc
is $(5.4\pm1.3)\times 10^{11} M_\odot$. Higher mass models require that M31 is
on its second orbit and that the halo is larger than the classical tidal limit
of the binary. Such models must have a significant fraction of the Local Group
mass in an extended Local Group halo. Lower mass models require that both M31
and Leo I are unbound, but there is no plausible mechanism to produce the
observed deviations of M31 and Leo I from their expected velocities in an
unbound system. If we do not use the Local Group timing model, the median mass
of the Galaxy {\it increases} significantly, and the error bars broaden. Using
only the satellite, escape velocity, and disk rotation curve constraints, the

We present new high-resolution, high signal-to-noise optical spectra of HD
77581, the optical counterpart of the X-ray source Vela X-1, and determine
radial velocities from these spectra, as well as from high-resolution IUE
spectra and from digitized photographic spectra. The measured velocities show
strong deviations from a pure Keplerian radial-velocity curve, which are
autocorrelated within one night, but not from one night to another. Since lines
of different ions exhibit very similar changes in profile, these deviations
most likely reflect large-scale motions of the stellar surface akin to
non-radial pulsations. A possible cause could be that the varying tidal force
exerted by the neutron star in its eccentric orbit excites high-order pulsation
modes in the optical star which interfere constructively for short time
intervals. The effect of such velocity excursions on the orbital solution is
estimated by means of a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. We investigate
sources of systematic error, due to, e.g., the tidal deformation of the star,
and find, in particular, evidence for a systematic perturbation of the radial
velocity near the time of velocity minimum. This possible distortion severely
compromises the accuracy of the radial-velocity amplitude, leading to a 95\%
confidence range of 18.0--28.2\,\kms. The corresponding 95\% confidence limits
of the masses are given by $\MX=1.9_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\,\Msun$ and
$\Mopt=23.5_{-1.5}^{+2.2}\,\Msun$.

We analyze the currently available observations of X-ray binaries in a
consistent way, to re-determine the masses of the neutron stars in these
systems. In particular, our attention is focussed on a realistic and consistent
assessment of observational uncertainties and sources of systematic error.
Confidence limits for these new mass estimates are generally less optimistic
than previously assumed. The available observations, including data on six
radio pulsars, do not firmly constrain the equation of state of neutron star
matter. In particular, a firm upper mass limit cannot yet be established. An
improvement of the accuracy of optical data holds the key to further progress.

We study the emission and absorption spectra due to various photon and pair
processes in a non-equilibrium pair plasma containing a significant density of
photons. We present here some preliminary results from Monte-Carlo simulations.
These investigations are likely to be useful in understanding the radiation and
relaxation mechanisms in non-thermal gamma-ray sources in astrophysics.

We present for astrophysical use a multi-dimensional numerical code to solve
the equations for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It is based on an explicit
finite difference method on an Eulerian grid, called the Total Variation
Diminishing (TVD) scheme, which is a second-order-accurate extension of the
Roe-type upwind scheme. Multiple spatial dimensions are treated through a
Strang-type operator splitting. The constraint of a divergence-free field is
enforced exactly by calculating a correction via a gauge transformation in each
time step.
  Results from two-dimensional shock tube tests show that the code captures
correctly discontinuities in all three MHD waves families as well as contact
discontinuities. The numerical viscosities and resistivity in the code, which
are useful in order to understand simulations involving turbulent flows, are
estimated through the decay of two-dimensional linear waves. Finally, the
robustness of the code in two-dimensions is demonstrated through calculations
of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the Orszag-Tang vortex.

A simple model of the nucleus of M31 based on {\it HST} images and ground
based spectroscopy is used to investigate the properties of the double nucleus
in M31. The model reproduces the general properties observed in the nucleus of
M31. In particular, it produces symmetric rotation curves, and shifts of the
velocity dispersion peak in the sense observed. Within the constraints of the
model, the brightest point in the $V$ band in the nucleus is confirmed to be
physically near to the dynamical center of M31 and not seen in projection along
the line of sight. The velocity and velocity dispersion of this object can be
constrained. This implies that P2 is colliding with M31 and likely to be in the
process of being tidally disrupted.

We present a simple model for the apparent superluminal motion along curved
trajectories of features observed in the compact radio jet of the quasar 3C345.
The model is inspired by the magneto-hydrodynamic approach of Camenzind (1986),
and assumes a conical geometry of the jet within about three milliarcseconds of
the radio core. Simultaneous conservation of three out of four physical
parameters is used to derive analytic solutions for the equation of motion of
the idealized jet features. These are the jet's kinetic energy, angular
momentum, and momentum along the jet axis. Conservation of angular momentum is
required to fit the observed trajectories at distances larger than 3
milliarcsec, in agreement with the kinematic predictions of Camenzind's model.
The best-fit model variant preserves angular momentum, kinetic energy, and
opening angle, with an inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight 6.8
degrees, an opening angle 0.95 degrees, and Lorentz factors 5.8 and 4.6 for
components C4 and C5, respectively (H_o=100 km/(s Mpc)). The model ignores
turbulent small-scale motion of the jet components, and it does not take into
account the overall bending of the jet beyond about 4 milliarcseconds,
restricting it's applicability to the inner few milliarcseconds from the core.

We discuss the phase--space distribution of $\mu$ neutrinos if $\tau$
neutrinos are unstable and decay into $\nu_\mu + scalar$. If this scalar is a
familon or a Majoron, in the generic case the $\nu_\mu$ background is NOT the
straightforward overlap of neutrinos of thermal and decay origins. A delay in
$\nu_\tau$ decay, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, can modify it in a
significant way. We provide the equations to calculate the $\nu_\mu$
distribution and show that, in some cases, there exists a good approximate
solution to them. However, even when such solution is not admitted, the
equations can be numerically solved following a precise pattern. We give such a
solution for a number of typical cases. If $\nu_\mu$ has a mass $\sim 2$ eV and
the see--saw argument holds, $\nu_\tau$ must be unstable and the decay into
$\nu_\mu + scalar$ is a reasonable possibility. The picture leads to a delayed
equivalence redshift, which could allow to reconcile COBE data with a bias
parameter $b\ge 1$.

The APM Cluster Survey was based on a modification of Abell's original
classification scheme for galaxy clusters. Here we discuss the results of an
investigation of the stability of the statistical properties of the cluster
catalogue to changes in the selection parameters. For a poor choice of
selection parameters we find clear indications of line-of-sight clusters, but
there is a wide range of input parameters for which the statistical properties
of the catalogue are stable. We conclude that clusters selected in this way are
indeed useful as tracers of large-scale structure.

Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers are believed to be associated with galactic
disks. We show that gravitational lensing can therefore affect the statistics
of these systems. First, the magnification bias due to lensing raises faint
QSOs above a given magnitude threshold and thereby enhances the probability for
observing damped absorption systems. Second, the bending of light rays from the
source effectively limits the minimum impact parameter of the line-of-sight
relative to the center of the absorber, thus providing an upper cut-off to the
observed neutral hydrogen (HI) column density. The combination of these effects
yields a pronounced peak in the observed abundance of absorbers with high
column densities (>2*10^{21} cm^{-2}) and low redshifts (z<1). The inferred
value of the cosmological density parameter of neutral hydrogen, Omega_{HI},
increases with increasing redshift and luminosity of the sources even if the
true HI density remains constant. This trend resembles the observed evolution
of Omega_{HI}(z). Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers with column densities >10^{21}
cm^{-2} and redshifts 0.5<z<1 are reliable flags for lensed QSOs with a close
pair of images separated by 0.3 arcsec. Detection of these gravitational
lensing signatures with the Hubble Space Telescope can be used to constrain the
depth of the absorber potential-wells and the cosmological constant.

In this paper we show how the prediction of CMBR angular power spectra $C_l$
in non-Gaussian theories is affected by a cosmic covariance problem, that is
$(C_l,C_{l'})$ correlations impart features on any observed $C_l$ spectrum
which are absent from the average $C^l$ spectrum. Therefore the average
spectrum is rendered a bad observational prediction, and two new prediction
strategies, better adjusted to these theories, are proposed. In one we search
for hidden random indices conditional to which the theory is released from the
correlations. Contact with experiment can then be made in the form of the
conditional power spectra plus the random index distribution. In another
approach we apply to the problem a principal component analysis. We discuss the
effect of correlations on the predictivity of non-Gaussian theories. We finish
by showing how correlations may be crucial in delineating the borderline
between predictions made by non-Gaussian and Gaussian theories. In fact, in
some particular theories, correlations may act as powerful non-Gaussianity
indicators.

This paper examines several methods of tracing galaxies in N-body simulations
and their effects on the derived galaxy statistics, especially measurements of
velocity bias. Using two simulations with identical initial conditions, one
following dark matter only and the other following dark matter and baryons,
both collisionless and collisional methods of tracing galaxies are compared to
one another and against a set of idealized criteria. None of the collisionless
methods proves satisfactory, including an elaborate scheme developed here to
circumvent previously known problems. The main problem is that galactic
overdensities are both secularly and impulsively disrupted while orbiting in
cluster potentials. With dissipation, the baryonic tracers have much higher
density contrasts and much smaller cross sections, allowing them to remain
distinct within the cluster potential. The question remains whether the
incomplete physical model introduces systematic biases. Statistical measures
determined from simulations can vary significantly based solely on the galaxy
tracing method utilized. The two point correlation function differs most on
sub-cluster scales with generally good agreement on larger scales. Pairwise
velocity dispersions show less uniformity on all scales addressed here. All
tracing methods show a velocity bias to varying degrees, but the predictions
are not firm: either the tracing method is not robust or the statistical
significance has not been demonstrated. Though theoretical arguments suggest
that a mild velocity bias should exist, simulation results are not yet
conclusive.

Following the recent suggestion that it is dwarf galaxies in clusters -- as
opposed to large ellipticals -- that provide the intracluster gas, we estimate
the metallicity of the intracluster medium (ICM) in such a case. We derive
analytical expressions for the fraction of mass of dwarf galaxies that is
ejected, and estimate the metallicity of the resulting intracluster gas. We
find that the metallicity resulting from this hypothesis is adequate only for
clusters with low-metallicity gas. Since galactic winds from dwarf galaxies
occur much earlier than those from ellipticals, due to the smaller binding
energy of the gas, we show that the gas ejected by dwarf galaxies is enriched
mostly by Type II supernovae, as opposed to Type I supernovae in the case of
large galaxies. We further point out that the gas in small scale structures,
which never cools and forms stars due to low temperatures and, consequently,
large cooling time scale, gets dispersed in the process of hierarchical
clustering, and is incorporated as the diffuse intracluster gas. We show that
this process can provide enough hot gas to be compatible with X-ray
observations in rich clusters.

We discuss a scenario in which the highest energy cosmic rays (CR's) and
cosmological $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB's) have a common origin. This scenario is
consistent with the observed CR flux above $10^{20}\text{eV}$, provided that
each burst produces similar energies in $\gamma$-rays and in CR's above
$10^{20}\text{eV}$. Protons may be accelerated by Fermi's mechanism to energies
$\sim10^{20}\text{eV}$ in a dissipative, ultra-relativistic wind, with
luminosity and Lorentz factor high enough to produce a GRB. For a homogeneous
GRB distribution, this scenario predicts an isotropic, time-independent CR
flux.

This is the first paper of a series of two devoted to develop a practical
method to describe the growth history of bound virialized objects in the
gravitational instability scenario without resorting to $N$-body simulations.
Here we present the basic tool of this method, ``the confluent system
formalism'', which allows us to follow the filtering evolution of peaks in a
random Gaussian field of density fluctuations. This is applied to derive the
theoretical mass function of objects within the peak model framework. Along the
process followed for the derivation of this function, we prove that the
Gaussian window is the only one consistent with the peak model ansatz. We also
give a well justified derivation of the density of peaks with density contrast
upcrossing a given threshold in infinitesimal ranges of scale and correct this
scale function for the cloud-in-cloud effect. Finally, we characterize the form
of the mass vs. scale and the critical overdensity vs. collapse time relations
which are physically consistent with the peak model in an Einstein-de Sitter
universe with density field endowed with different power spectra. The result is
a fully justified semianalytical mass function which is close to the Press \&
Schechter (1974) one giving good fits to $N$-body simulations. But the interest
of the confluent system formalism is not merely formal. It allows us to
distinguish between accretion and merger events, which is essential for the
detailed modelling of the clustering process experienced by objects.

Galaxies and clusters distributions show two major properties: (i) the
positions of galaxies and clusters are characterized by a power law
distribution indicating properties with respect to their positions. (ii) The
distribution of masses is also characterized by a power law corresponding to
self similarity of different nature. These two properties are naturally unified
by the concept of multifractality. This concept naturally arises if the
distribution of matter, as given by both positions and masses, has self similar
properties. We discuss the experimental situation in this respect and we
introduce a simple stochastic model based of the aggregation process of
particles The aim of this model is to understand which characteristic
properties of the aggregation probability can gives rise to multifractal
distribution In particular we find that a crucial element in this respect is
that the aggregation probability should depend on the environment of the
aggregation region.

We report optical, soft X-ray, and UV observations of the peculiar Seyfert
galaxy IC 3599 using data obtained with ROSAT and IUE. Most remarkably, we
discovered a rapid decrease of the X-ray flux by a factor of about 100 within
one year and a more gradual decrease thereafter. The X-ray spectrum of IC 3599
was soft at flux maximum and became even softer as the flux decreased.
Simultaneously with the late decrease of the X-ray flux, we observed a decrease
in the strength of highly ionized optical iron lines. We discuss several
explanations for this behaviour including an accretion disk instability and
tidal disruption of a star orbiting a central massive black hole.

We show how to develop an expansion of nearly oblate systems in terms of a
set of potential-density pairs. A harmonic (multipole) structure is imposed on
the potential set at infinity, and the density can be made everywhere regular.
We concentrate on a set whose zeroth order functions describe the perfect
oblate spheroid of de Zeeuw (1985). This set is not bi-orthogonal, but it can
be shown to be complete in a weak sense. Poisson's equation can be solved
approximately by truncating the expansion of the potential in such a set. A
simple example of a potential which is not one of the basis functions is
expanded using the symmetric members of the basis set up to fourth order. The
basis functions up to first order are reconstructed approximately using 10,000
particles to show that this set could be used as part of an $N$-body code.

We study a sample of 257 Galactic disk M dwarfs (8<M_V<18.5) found in images
obtained using HST. These include 192 stars in 22 fields imaged with the
repaired WFC2 with mean limiting mag I=23.7 and 65 stars in 162 fields imaged
with the pre-repair Planetary Camera with mean limiting mag V=21.3. We find
that the disk luminosity function (LF) drops sharply for M_V>12 (M<0.25 \ms),
decreasing by a factor \gsim 3 by M_V~14 (M~0.14\ms). This decrease in the LF
is in good agreement with the ground-based photometric study of nearby stars by
Stobie et al. (1989), and in mild conflict with the most recent LF measurements
based on local parallax stars by Reid et al. (1995). The local LF of the faint
Galactic disk stars can be transformed into a local mass function using an
empirical mass-M_V relation. The mass function can be represented analytically
over the mass range 0.1\ms<M<1.6\ms by \log(\phi)=-1.35-1.34\log(M/\ms)-1.85
[\log(M/\ms)]^2 where \phi is the number density per logarithmic unit of mass.
The total column density of M stars is only \Sigma_M=11.8\pm 1.8\ms\pc^{-2},
implying a total `observed' disk column density of \Sigma_\obs~=39\ms\pc^{-2},
lower than previously believed, and also lower than all estimates with which we
are familiar of the dynamically inferred mass of the disk. The measured scale
length for the M-star disk is 3.0\pm 0.4 kpc. The optical depth to microlensing
toward the LMC by the observed stars in the Milky Way disk is \tau~1x10^{-8},
compared to the observed optical depth found in ongoing experiments \tau_\obs~
10^{-7}. The M-stars show evidence for a population with characteristics
intermediate between thin disk and spheroid populations. Approximating what may
be a continuum of populations by two separate component, we find characteristic
exponential scale heights of ~210 pc and ~740 pc.

A quantitative theory, based on the Zeldovich approximation, to provide an
approximate description of the evolution of structure is presented. We give an
expression for the characteristic scale of superlarge-scale structure which can
also be applied to power spectra with a Harrison-Zeldovich asymptotic. The
evolution of the characteristic scale of large-scale structure is described
with an analytical expression. It corresponds to the mean separation of
filaments or chains of galaxies.
  We apply the theory to some simulations and show that the theoretically
defined characteristic scale for LSS does also correspond to the 'physical
measurement' of the mean separation of dark matter LSS elements. This supports
our claim for a new theory for the quantitative description of the formation
and evolution of large-scale structure in the universe.

Luminosities and tidal radii of globular clusters have been used to estimate
the perigalactic distances P of well-observed Galactic globulars that do not
have collapsed cores. It is found that the cluster metallicity [Fe/H]
correlates somewhat more strongly with P than it does with the present
Galactocentric distances R of globular clusters. It is also found that both P
and R correlate more strongly with the cluster half-light radii rh than they do
with [Fe/H]. This suggests that cluster radii are mainly determined by global
parameters of the (proto)Galaxy, whereas [Fe/H] may have been more strongly
affected by local evolutionary effects. The strong correlation (P) = 0.70 +/-
0.05 between the perigalactic distances and half-light radii of globular
clusters is particularly striking. The half-light radii rh of globular clusters
in the outer halo of the Galaxy are found to correlate with R, and even more
strongly with P. It is not yet clear how this result is to be reconciled with
the Searle-Zinn scenario for the formation of the outer halo of the Galaxy. The
tidal radii of clusters with collapsed cores appear to have been systematically
over-estimated, resulting in perigalactic distances that are too large. Halo
globulars with P > 15 kpc are (with the exception of NGC 2419) typically an
order of magnitude less luminous than the clusters with P < 15 kpc that are
associated with the main body of the Galaxy. The population of nuclear globular
clusters with P < 1 kpc appears to be deficient in objects fainter than MV ~
-7. Clusters with well-determined ages having P > 15 kpc have ages in the range
9 - 16 Gyr, whereas globulars with P < 15 kpc all appear to have ages that are
restricted to the narrower range 13 < T < 16 Gyr.

The dependence of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate on galaxy type is
examined for three currently proposed scenarios: merging of a
Chandrasekhar--mass CO white dwarf (WD) with a CO WD companion, explosion of a
sub--Chandrasekhar mass CO WD induced by accretion of material from a He star
companion, and explosion of a sub--Chandrasekhar CO WD in a symbiotic system.
The variation of the SNe Ia rate and explosion characteristics with time is
derived, and its correlation with parent population age and galaxy redshift is
discussed. Among current scenarios, CO + He star systems should be absent from
E galaxies. Explosion of CO WDs in symbiotic systems could account for the SNe
Ia rate in these galaxies. The same might be true for the CO + CO WD scenario,
depending on the value of the common envelope parameter. A testable prediction
of the sub--Chandrasekhar WD model is that the average brightness and kinetic
energy of the SN Ia events should increase with redshift for a given Hubble
type. Also for this scenario, going along the Hubble sequence from E to Sc
galaxies SNe Ia events should be brighter on average and should show larger
mean velocities of the ejecta. The observational correlations strongly suggest
that the characteristics of the SNe Ia explosion are linked to parent
population age. The scenario in which WDs with masses below the Chandrasekhar
mass explode appears the most promising one to explain the observed variation
of the SN Ia rate with galaxy type together with the luminosity--expansion
velocity trend.

The rapid increase in data on galaxy images at low and high redshift calls
for re-examination of the classification schemes and for new automatic
objective methods. Here we present a classification method by Artificial Neural
Networks. We also show results from a comparative study we carried out using a
new sample of 830 APM digitised galaxy images. These galaxy images were
classified by 6 experts independently. It is shown that the ANNs can replicate
the classification by a human expert almost to the same degree of agreement as
that between two human experts, to within 2 $T$-type units. Similar methods can
be applied to automatic classification of galaxy spectra. We illustrate it by
Principal Component Analysis of galaxy spectra, and discuss future large
surveys.

Recently (Brown \& Bethe 1994) it was suggested that most stars with main
sequence mass in the range of about $18 - 30 M_{\odot}$ explode, returning
matter to the Galaxy, and then go into low-mass ($\geq 1.5 M_{\odot}$) black
holes. Even more massive main-sequence stars would, presumably, chiefly g o
into high-mass ($\sim 10 M_{\odot}$) black holes. The Brown-Bethe estimates
gave approximately $5 \times {10}^{8}$ low-mass black holes in the Galaxy. A
pressing question, which we attempt to answer here, is why, with the possible
exception of the compact objects in SN1987A and 4U\,1700--37, none of these
have been seen.
  We address this question in three parts. Firstly, black holes are generally
``seen'' only in binaries, by the accretion of matter from a companion star.
High mass black holes are capable of accreting more matter than low-mass black
holes, so there is a selection effect favoring them. This, in itself, would not
be sufficient to show why low-mass black holes have not been seen, since
neutron stars (of nearly the same mass) are seen in abundance.
  Secondly, and this is our main point, the primary star in a binary ---the
first star to evolve--- loses its hydrogen envelope by transfer of matter to
the secondary and loss into space, and the resulting ``naked'' helium star
evolves differently than a helium core, which is at least initially covered by
the hydrogen envelope in a massive main-sequence star. We show that primary
stars in binaries can end up as neutron stars even if their initial mass
substantially exceeds the mass limit for neutron star formation from single
stars ($\sim 18 M_{\odot}$). An example is 4U\,1223--62, in which we suggest
that the initial primary mass exceeded $35 M_{\odot}$, yet X-ray pulsations

A common target acquisition strategy with the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS)
on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is to use a sequence of so-called
ACQ/PEAK stages. Standard sequences and exposure times are given in the FOS
Instrument Handbook (Keyes et al.~1995). The success of a given strategy is
difficult to predict a priori for targets other than point sources. This paper
describes software that simulates ACQ/PEAK acquisitions in a Monte-Carlo
manner, for a variety of targets. The software is available from the FOS
Instrument Scientists or from the author. It allows a proper quantitative
assessment to be made of whether an acquisition will succeed, what exposure
times should be used, and how the efficiency can be optimized.

The positions of over 1000 gamma-ray bursts detected with the BATSE
experiment on board of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory are uniformly and
randomly distributed in the sky, with no significant concentration to the
galactic plane or to the galactic center. The strong gamma-ray bursts have an
intensity distribution consistent with a number density independent of distance
in Euclidean space. Weak gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare, indicating that
either their number density is reduced at large distances or that the space in
which they are distributed is non-Euclidean. In other words, we appear to be at
the center of a spherical and bounded distribution of bursters. This is
consistent with the distribution of all objects that are known to be at
cosmological distances (like galaxies and quasars), but inconsistent with the
distribution of any objects which are known to be in our galaxy (like stars and
globular clusters). If the bursters are at cosmological distances then the
weakest bursts should be redshifted, i.e. on average their durations should be
longer and their spectra should be softer than the corresponding quantities for
the strong bursts. There is some evidence for both effects in the BATSE data.
  At this time the cosmological distance scale is strongly favored over the
galactic one, but is not proven. A definite proof (or dis-proof) could be
provided with the results of a search for very weak bursts in the Andromeda
galaxy (M31) with an instrument $ \sim 10 $ times more sensitive than BATSE.
  If the bursters are indeed at cosmological distances then they are the most
luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the universe. At this
time we have no clue as to their nature, even though well over a hundred
suggestions were published in the scientific journals. An experiment providing

We report the discovery of two bright arcs in what turns out to be the
brightest X--ray cluster in the ROSAT band ever observed, RXJ1347.5-1145. Its
luminosity is $(6.2\pm0.6) \cdot10^{45}$erg s$^{-1}$ (in the range
0.1--2.4~keV). The arcs are most probably gravitationally lensed images of
background galaxies. They were found serendipitously during our ongoing
large--scale redshift survey of X--ray clusters detected by the ROSAT All Sky
Survey. The arcs are almost opposite to each other with respect to the cluster
centre, with a distance from it of about $35''$ ($=240 h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc), a
radius that enables the probing of a rather large cluster volume. In this
Letter we limit ourselves to the discussion of the general optical and X--ray
features of this cluster and to the potential implications of the gravitational
arcs. A more detailed discussion of the different mass estimates and of the
cosmological implications for this exceptional object are left for future work
based on more accurate optical and X--ray data, which are currently being
collected.

We address the problem of deriving, from the observed projected metallicity
gradients, the intrinsic metallicity distribution of elliptical galaxies as a
function of their integrals of motion. The method is illustrated by an
application to anisotropic spherical Hernquist models. We also compare the
derived metallicity distribution with those expected from two very simple
models of galaxy formation and find that the more dissipative scheme agrees
better with the typical metallicity distribution of ellipticals.

Galaxy redshift surveys provide a distorted picture of the universe due to
the non-Hubble component of galaxy motions. By measuring such distortions in
the linear regime one can constrain the quantity $\beta = \Omega^{0.6}/b$ where
$\Omega$ is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the (linear) bias
factor for optically-selected galaxies. In this paper we apply two techniques
for estimating $\beta$ from the Stromlo-APM redshift survey --- (1) measuring
the anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function in spherical
harmonics and (2) comparing the amplitude of the direction-averaged redshift
space correlation function to the real space correlation function. We test the
validity of these techniques, particularly whether the assumption of linear
theory is justified, using two sets of large $N$-body simulations. We find that
the first technique is affected by non-linearities on scales up to $\sim 30
\hMpc$. The second technique is less sensitive to non-linear effects and so is
more useful for existing redshift surveys. The Stromlo-APM survey data favours
a low value for $\beta$, with $\beta \simlt 0.6$. A bias parameter $b \approx
2$ is thus required if $\Omega \equiv 1$. However, higher-order correlations
measured from the APM galaxy survey (Gazta\~{n}aga and Frieman 1994) indicate a
low value for the bias parameter $b \approx 1$, requiring that $\Omega \simlt
0.5$. We also measure the relative bias for samples of galaxies of various
luminosity and morphological type and find that low-luminosity galaxies are
roughly three times less biased than $L^*$ galaxies. For the galaxy population
as a whole, we measure a real space variance of galaxy counts in $8 \hMpc$
spheres of $(\sigma^2_8)_g = 0.89 \pm 0.05$.

We use a free-energy minimization approach to describe the secular and
dynamical instabilities as well as the bifurcations along equilibrium sequences
of rotating, self-gravitating fluid systems. Our approach is fully nonlinear
and stems from the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions. Here we examine
higher than 2nd-harmonic disturbances applied to Maclaurin spheroids, the
corresponding bifurcating sequences, and their relation to nonlinear fission
processes. The triangle and ammonite sequences bifurcate from the two
3rd-harmonic neutral points on the Maclaurin sequence while the square and
one-ring sequences bifurcate from two of the three known 4th harmonic neutral
points. In the other three cases, secular instability does not set in at the
corresponding bifurcation points because the sequences stand and terminate at
higher energies relative to the Maclaurin sequence. There is no known
bifurcating sequence at the point of 3rd-harmonic dynamical instability. Our
nonlinear approach easily identifies resonances between the Maclaurin sequence
and various multi-fluid-body sequences that cannot be detected by linear
stability analyses. Resonances appear as first-order phase transitions at
points where the energies of the two sequences are nearly equal but the lower
energy state belongs to one of the multi-fluid-body sequences.

The study of anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation is
progressing at a phenomenal rate, both experimentally and theoretically. These
anisotropies can teach us an enormous amount about the way that fluctuations
were generated and the way they subsequently evolved into the clustered
galaxies which are observed today. In particular, on sub-degree scales the rich
structure in the anisotropy spectrum is the consequence of gravity-driven
acoustic oscillations occurring before the matter in the universe became
neutral. The frozen-in phases of these sound waves imprint a dependence on many
cosmological parameters, that we may be on the verge of extracting.

The formalism of Wiener filtering is applied to reconstruct, in terms of
spherical harmonics, the projected $4\pi$ galaxy distribution of a mock IRAS
1.2 Jy catalog with a `Zone of Avoidance' $|b| = 15^\circ$. The Singular Value
Decomposition al gorithm is utilized as an extra-regularizer in order to
stabilize the inversion. This case sheds light on the amount of useful
information contained in the data, and also suggests a method for obtaining an
`optimal' functional basis, based on our \prior knowledge, for the purposes of
likelihood analysis and Wiener reconstruction of cosmological data sets. The
applicability of such a functional basis for redshift galaxy catalogs is also
discussed.

The simple unification scheme of powerful radio galaxies and quasars, based
entirely on the orientation dependent effects, has been confronted with the
observed radio structures for 152 radio galaxies and 173 steep spectrum
quasars. Contrary to the scheme's prediction, the cosmological evolution of
geometrical parameters describing the large scale structure of these two types
of radio sources are different. Linear size, arm ratio asymmetry and bending
are all together stronger evolving with epoch for radio galaxies. Moreover,
linear size and bending are more closely correlated with radio luminosity for
radio galaxies than for quasars. This supports the supposition that, even if
these two AGN classes are intrinsically identical sets of objects in deep
interior regions, their large scale structures reveal rather various host
environmental conditions which can lead to various classes of objects.

A distribution of points that satisfies the property of local isotropy is not
necessarily homogeneous: homogeneity is implied by the condition of local
isotropy together with the assumption of analyticity or regularity. Here we
show that the evidence of dipole saturation in galaxies (and clusters)
catalogues, together with a monotone growth of the monopole, is an evidence of
isotropy but not of homogeneity. This is fully compatible with a fractal
structure which has the property of local isotropy, but it is non-analytic and
non-homogeneous.

A detailed model of galactic evolution is proposed to explain both the iron
content of the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and of the ellipticals pertaining to
the cluster. SNII are responsible for the production of Fe in the galaxies and
of its partial ejection in the surrounding medium. A high formation rate of
massive stars only ($m>3~{\rm M_{\sun}}$) at the very early stage of evolution
of ellipticals, reminiscent of starburst galaxies, is advocated. The high rate
of SNII explosions induces a powerful galactic wind, followed by a more
quiescent evolution where stars are formed, with a normal Initial Mass Function
(IMF), from the enriched gas remaining after the wind phase and from the gas
restored by the longest living stars produced during the early phase. Most of
the iron is produced by the high-mass stars created in the early burst phase.

A newly developed isochrone synthesis algorithm for the photometric evolution
of galaxies is described. Two initial mass functions, IMFs, in particular, the
recent IMF determined by Kroupa, Tout, and Gilmore, three photometric
transformations, and a 1-Gyr-burst star formation rate, SFR, are used to
compute the $B-V$ and $V-K$ color index evolution. Non-negligible differences
are observed among model results.
  In the framework of the galaxy count model by Col\'in, Schramm, and Peimbert
a simple merging scenario is considered to account for the excess of galaxies
observed in the blue band counts. The excess is explained by the number and
luminosity evolution of a group of galaxies called interacting, I. It is
assumed that the number of I galaxies increases as $(1+z)^{\eta}$ due to
mergers. Moreover, it is proposed that their characteristic luminosity
increases as $(1+z)^3$ due to starbursts driven by galaxy-galaxy collision and
decreases as $(1+z)^{-\eta}$ due to the change in the size of the galaxies. Not
much number evolution is needed to account for the excess; for example, a model
with $\eta = 4.0$ predicts that about 17 \% of the galaxies at $z = 0.4$ are
interacting. Number evolution models with a rather high value of $\eta$ fit
better the data; in particular, the model with $\eta = 4.0$ predicts that about
13 \% of the galaxies have $z > 0.7$ in the $21.0 < m_{b_J} < 22.5$ interval,
this contrasts with the upper bound of 5 \% obtained with the sample of 78
galaxies by Colless et al. The excess of high redshift galaxies can not be
simply explained by changing reasonably the parameters of the luminosity
function of I galaxies. This result could indicate that mergers are not the
whole story. Our best-fit model produces the following values for the

I review the current data on abundances in irregular galaxies, with special
emphasis on recent results on C/O and Si/O from observations with the Hubble
Space Telescope. The abundance data for He, C, N, and O in irregular galaxies
is discussed in the context of models for the evolution of dwarf galaxies.

We study the azimuthal structure of the stellar disks of 18 face-on spiral
galaxies, using K-band photometry to trace the stellar surface mass density.
Assuming the disks are co-planar, we characterize their deviation from
axisymmetry by the fractional amplitudes, A_i and phases of the azimuthal
Fourier components at radii R about the photometric galaxy center. We find that
most disks exhibit a wealth of non-axisymmetric structures, specifically: (1)
that about one third of them are substantially lopsided (A_1/A_0>= 0.20) at 2.5
disk exponential scale length, (2) that almost one half of them have strong
two-armed spirals with an arm/interarm surface-brightness contrasts of order
unity, and (3) that typical disks have some intrinsic ellipticity. We estimate
that in the disk plane the characteristic ellipticity of the underlying
potential is 0.045+-0.03. However, the spiral pattern couples significantly to
the estimate of the intrinsic ellipticity, and our measurement may represent an
upper limit on the ``true" potential triaxiality. We estimate the radial
streaming motions of the disk stars, $v_R$, which are produced by these
distortions. By averaging over our sample of galaxies and all azimuthal angles,
we find v_R=7km/s due to lopsided distortions and 6km/s due to intrinsic
ellipticity. These non-circular motions are expected to contribute about
0.15mags scatter to measurements of the Tully-Fisher relation.

In this paper we present new CCD investigations of RR Lyrae pulsators in the
Oo.I globular cluster M5. B V curves of light for 15 RR Lyrae are presented.
With the addition of further 11 curves of light by Storm, Carney and Beck
(1991) one is dealing with a sample of 26 well studied cluster pulsators whose
properties have been implemented with similar data for RR Lyrae in clusters M3,
M15, M68 to allow a comparison with the theoretical scenario recently presented
by Bono and Stellingwerf (1994). On this basis, we discuss the distribution of
stars in the period amplitude diagram, disclosing a substantial reduction of
Sandage's period shift. We suggest that theoretical constraints concerning
periods and amplitudes could allow information on masses and luminosity of the
pulsators directly from Bailey's diagram only. Static temperatures have been
derived for all stars in the sample, discussing the dependence on the
temperature of the observed pulsational properties.

We investigate the performance of Lagrangian perturbation theory up to the
second order for two scenarios of cosmological large-scale structure formation,
SCDM (standard cold dark matter) and BSI (broken scale invariance). The latter
model we study as a representative of COBE-normalized CDM models which fit the
small-scale power of galaxy surveys. In this context we optimize the
performance of the Lagrangian perturbation schemes by smoothing the small-scale
fluctuations in the initial data. The results of the so obtained Lagrangian
mappings are computed for a set of COBE-normalized SCDM and BSI initial data of
different sizes and at different times. We compare these results against those
obtained with a numerical PM-code. We find an excellent performance of the
optimized Lagrangian schemes down to scales close to the correlation length.
This is explained by the counterintuitive fact that nonlinearities in the model
can produce more small-scale power, if initially such power is removed. The
optimization scheme can be expressed in a way which is independent of the type
of fluctuation spectrum and of the size of the simulations.

Moderately deep near-infrared images are used to investigate the photometric
properties and spatial distribution of bright giants near the centers of the
core-collapsed globular clusters NGC5946 and NGC7099. The former cluster is
located at a low Galactic latitude and is heavily reddened; nevertheless, the
K, J-K color-magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a well-defined giant branch, with a
width +/- 0.05 magnitudes in J-K. Most of the observed width is due to
differential reddening. The upper giant branch is relatively steep, and
comparisons with less reddened clusters indicate that (1) NGC5946 must be very
metal-poor, with [Fe/H] ~ -2, and (2) E(B-V) ~ 0.6. The distance to NGC5946
derived using the near-infrared brightness of the giant branch tip is in
excellent agreement with that computed from the V brightness of the HB if
E(B-V) = 0.6.
  The NGC7099 giant branch terminates ~ 1 mag fainter in K than the expected
tip brightness. The integrated J-K color of NGC7099 changes with radius, such
that Delta (J-K) /Delta log(r) = 0.05 - 0.09, depending on the technique used
to measure colors. Similar radial variations in stellar content might be
expected in NGC5946; however, the integrated J-K color of this cluster remains
constant with radius and, after removing the brightest resolved stars, a color
gradient is seen that is in the opposite sense to that in NGC7099. The relative
density of bright giant branch stars also remains constant within 30 arcsec of
the center of NGC5946. Therefore, it is concluded that NGC5946 does not contain
stellar content gradients similar to those seen in NGC7099 and other post
core-collapsed clusters.

We have observed rovibrational transitions of acetylene and HCN near 13
microns in absorption toward GL2591. We also observed rotational lines of CS,
HCN, H2CO, and HCO+. The combined data are analyzed in terms of models with a
cloud envelope with density gradients and discrete regions of hot, dense gas,
probably near the infrared source. The abundance of HCN is enhanced by a factor
of 400 in the gas producing the infrared absorption, in agreement with chemical
models which involve depletion of molecules onto grains and subsequent
sublimation when temperatures are raised.

After Michel (1994) introduced a phenomenological picture of `rapid
magnetization' of newly born neutron stars (NSs), Muslimov & Page (1995)
suggested that the physical conditions accompanying the formation of a NS may
result in the surface magnetic field of the NS having a low value (~ 10^8 -
10^9 G) while the bulk of the flux is submerged under the stellar surface. The
subsequent growth of the surface magnetic field occurs owing to ohmic diffusion
of a strong internal field (10^12-10^13 G) and proceeds over a time scale of
10^2-10^3 yrs, depending on the early thermal history of the NS, the initial
distribution of magnetic flux and the electrical resistivity in the stellar
crust, as well as on the details of the stellar structure. Referring to this
suggestion, we perform numerical computations to demonstrate its possible
relevance to young radio pulsars. In our calculations, we use different NS
structures based on a model of dense matter presenting a phase transition to
kaon condensation which implies both slow and fast neutrino cooling, depending
on the stellar mass. We present sequences of secular evolution of the surface
magnetic field, spin-down luminosity, spin period, `braking index', and
spin-down age best matching the corresponding measured quantities for PSR
0531+21 (Crab), PSR 0540-69, and PSR 1509-58. We conclude that the effect under
consideration reproduces remarkably well both the observed rotational
characteristics and derived values of the surface magnetic field strength for
these radio pulsars, the only ones having reliable measurements of the braking
indices. In addition, our analysis suggests that the NSs in the Crab and PSR
0540-69 have experienced fast neutrino cooling while the NS in PSR 1509-58 has
undergone slow cooling and hence has a mass below the critical mass.

The paper is based on lectures on the internal structure and evolution of the
Sun. It contains an outline of observational and theoretical elements of the

rotation, magnetic fields, thermonuclear energy generation, and solar activity.

The effect of kick velocity to newly born pulsars on the distribution of
$\gamma$-ray bursters is examined in the context of a disk origin model and a
halo model of $\gamma$-ray bursters. The conversion formula from a
2-dimensional velocity distribution function to a 3-dimensional distribution
function is derived and applied to reproduce the distribution function of the
kick velocity of radio pulsars. Monte Carlo simulations of the kicked neutron
stars show that the disk neutron star model of $\gamma$-ray bursters still
needs unnatural assumptions if the velocity distribution of the $\gamma$-ray
bursters is the same as that of neutron stars---only neutron stars with very
high kick velocities can become $\gamma$-ray bursters and there are silent
majorities. On the other hand, the core radius of $\gamma$-ray bursters is not
found to be extended by the kick velocity if the core-halo structure similar to
the Galactic dark matter distribution is based on the initial distribution of
the halo neutron stars. Thus the introduction of a kick velocity to neutron
stars do not improve the statistics of neither the disk model nor the halo
model. Two possibilities to save Galactic models are suggested: (1) The
$\gamma-$ray bursters are old neutron stars which were accelerated to
velocities faster than $750~{\rm km\; s^{-1}}$ by jet propulsion and passed the
death line for pulsars due to spin down from the rotational energy loss by jet
ejection. (2) The initial distribution of neutron stars is fairly uniform and
the extent of the halo is large enough for the halo model to be consistent with
the observations. It implies that the initial star formation burst of the
Galaxy occurred fairly uniformly in the extended halo region.

We compute the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies on the
microwave sky in the cosmic texture theory, with standard recombination
assumed. The spectrum shows `Doppler' peaks analogous to those in scenarios
based on primordial adiabatic fluctuations such as `standard CDM', but at quite
different angular scales. There appear to be excellent prospects for using this
as a discriminant between inflationary and cosmic defect theories.

We present the first high resolution polarization map of the ultraviolet
emission from the outer jet in M87. The data were obtained by the Faint Object
Camera (FOC) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The polarization map has a
resolution of 0.2 arcsec and was derived using data from three linearly
polarized images combined with the best available calibration data. The
ultraviolet emission is highly polarized (~40\%) with the magnetic vector
aligned roughly with the jet axis, except in the region of the brightest knot
(Knot A) where the position angle changes abruptly and the magnetic vector
becomes perpendicular to the jet axis. A similar behaviour is seen in the 2cm
VLA radio polarization map. By aligning the FOC and VLA data, we present
ultraviolet--2cm spectral index, depolarization and rotation measure maps. We
identify a region of high depolarization adjacent to Knot A. This is the first
direct observational evidence that indicates the presence of a cloud or
filament of dense thermal material which is mixed with the synchrotron emitting
plasma of the jet. The interaction of the jet with this cloud is likely to be
responsible for the sudden increase in the brightness of the jet at Knot A due
to an induced shock. We suggest that the dark line seen in the 2cm radio data
between Knot A and Knot C could be the shadow or magnetotail of the
depolarizing cloud in the jet.

HST images of the western hot spot of the nearby FRII radio galaxy Pictor A
resolve the hot spot into an amorphous region of highly polarized wisps. The
high polarization (>~ 50%) indicates that the optical emission is synchrotron
radiation and that the magnetic field structure has been well resolved. The
magnetic field is oriented nearly perpendicular to the jet axis and apparently
very uniform. We interpret these observations in terms of a compressed magnetic
field at the working surface where the jet impinges on the intergalactic medium
some 100 kpc from the nucleus of the host galaxy.

We describe an implementation of the structure functions of Babul \&
Starkman, in order to quantify the ``sheet-like'' nature of a distribution of
matter. We test this statistic on a toy model describing cosmic string wakes,
and show that it does a better job than other statistics which have been
proposed for distinguishing non-Gaussianity in the form of sheets. We conclude
that the most favoured cosmic string model is unlikely to produce a significant
increase in the sheet-like nature of the matter distribution beyond that which
occurs in Gaussian models (with the same power spectrum) due to the formation
of Zeldovich pancakes. Although the statistic was developed in the context of
cosmic string wake formation, we expect it to be useful for comparing the
observed galaxy distribution with a wide range of theoretical models with
different power spectra.

The MACHO Collaboration's search for baryonic dark matter via its
gravitational microlensing signature has generated a massive database of time
ordered photometry of millions of stars in the LMC and the bulge of the Milky
Way. The search's experimental design and capabilities are reviewed and the
dark matter results are briefly noted. Preliminary analysis of the
approximately 39,000 variable stars discovered in the LMC database is presented
and examples of periodic variables are shown. A class of aperiodically variable
Be stars is described which is the closest background to microlensing which has
been found. Plans for future work on variable stars using the MACHO data are
described.

With its cometary appearance and a reflection nebula near its edge facing
some bright Orion stars, the Lynd's cloud L1616 shows ample evidence for being
affected by one or more of these massive stars. To estimate its mass and star
formation efficiency as well as to determine if it is gravitationally bound, we
mapped this cloud in J=1${\rightarrow}$0 transitions of $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}$CO. It is found that the distribution of the emission in the line {\it
wings} show clear evidence for substantial mass motions. Also, the ``virial''
mass of the cloud is found to be five times the actual cloud mass determined
from the $^{13}$CO column density map. It is argued that this cloud has
abnormally high star formation efficiency and is possibly disintegrating. The
morphology and the location of the cloud indicate that it is being affected by
the star ${\epsilon}$ Orionis which is also possibly responsible for the
cloud's unusual star formation efficiency. Over a range of values of the
relevant parameters, the star is found to quantitatively satisfy the
requirements of being the cause of the observed characteristics of the cloud.

Radio core dominance, usually measured by R, the rest frame ratio of core to
lobe flux density, has been used as an indicator of Doppler boosting of
quasars' radio jets and hence the inclination of the central engine's spin axis
to the line of sight. The use of lobe flux density as a means of normalizing
the boosted core flux density to the available intrinsic power of the central
engine introduces scatter. This is because the emission from the radio lobes
depends strongly on the interaction of the jet with the environment at
distances beyond several Kpc from the nucleus. Total kinetic power in the
extended radio emission is approximately proportional to emission line
luminosity, and emission line luminosity is proportional to the luminosity of
AGNs' featureless continua -- both over 4 orders of magnitude. Thus, quasars'
optical luminosity may be an excellent measure of available intrinsic jet
power. Therefore we define a new core dominance parameter, R$_V$, the ratio of
radio core to optical (rest frame V band) continuum luminosity, that is not
directly dependent on jet interactions with the super-Kpc-scale environment. We
show that the use of R$_V$, rather than R, results in significantly improved
inverse correlations with the beaming angle as deduced from apparent
superluminal velocities and inverse Compton scattered X-ray emission, and with
the FWHM of quasars' broad H$\beta$ emission line. We discuss some implications
and applications of the new parameter.

The stellar luminosity function derived from the sample of stars within
5.2--20~pc is the nearby luminosity function. The luminosity function obtained
from deep low spatial resolution surveys to distances of typically 100--200~pc
is the photometric luminosity function. We obtain and tabulate a best estimate
of the parent distribution from which Malmquist corrected photometric
luminosity functions are sampled. This is presently the most {\it accurate} and
{\it precise} available estimate of the true distribution of stars with
absolute magnitude for $M_{\rm V}\le16.5$, as derived from low-resolution
surveys. Using rigorous statistical analysis we find that the hypothesis that
the nearby and photometric luminosity functions estimate the same parent
luminosity function can be discarded with 99~per~cent confidence or better for
$M_{\rm V}>13,M_{\rm bol}>10$.

BV photometry is presented for 12 RR Lyr variables discovered in the
presumably young galactic globular cluster Ruprecht 106. All variables are type
RRab, and their periods span a narrow range from 0.574 to 0.652 day. We report
also on the discovery of 3 SX Phe variables among the cluster blue stragglers.
A likely background RR Lyr variable and two foreground contact binaries were
also found in the cluster field. The reddening of Ruprecht 106 is estimated at
E(B-V)=0.20 based on the (B-V) colors exhibited by the cluster RR Lyr variables
at minimum light. Analysis of the "period" versus "amplitude" and "period"
versus "rise-time" diagrams suggests similar metallicities of Ruprecht 106 and
M3. A peak (or bump) is present in the luminosity function of the red giant
branch of Ruprecht 106. Its position relative to the horizontal branch is
consistent with a cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]>= -1.6.

We investigated the dependence of the optical depth $\tau$ of the
microlensing events on model parameters of the Galactic halo. We only consider
Galactic mass models in which the rotation curve inside the Sun is compatible
with the observation and LMC is bound to the Galaxy. It is found that $\tau$
varies up to a factor 2.5 from the standard spherical and flat rotation halo
model. This implies that only the most centrally concentrated halo model can be
consistent with the observation if the halo consists of only MACHOs. We also
calculate the power $x$ of IMF of MACHO consistent with Tyson's CCD survey as
well as Bahcall \etal's observation by {\em HST}. It is found that $x$ is
greater than 5.

The spectra of the QSOs PKS2126-158 ($z_{em}=3.27$) and Q0055-269
($z_{em}=3.66$) have been observed at high resolution ($2.2 - 2.7 \times
10^4$). Significant clustering, with $\xi \simeq 1$ at $\Delta v=100$ km
s$^{-1}$, is detected in both cases for lines with $\log N_{HI} \geq 13.8$. A
similar result is obtained analysing the data available in the literature for
Q0014+81. An anticlustering signal is also detected on scales $\Delta v \sim
600$ km s$^{-1}$. Two voids of size $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$ are found in the
spectrum of Q0055-269 with a probability of $2\times 10^{-4}$.

We have investigated the spatial distribution of quasars and its relationship
with redshift by using the two-point correlation function, the variance of cell
counts and the conditional density as a function of redshift. By comparing our
results with those found by other authors we conclude that quasars have a
correlation function with amplitude similar to or greater than that of
galaxies, but the issue of its evolution still needs to be settled. We discuss
how this can be achieved by adding new observations and comparing real data
with survey simulations.

This is the first paper in a series aimed at defining a statistically
significant sample of QSOs in the range $ 15 < B < 18.75$ and $ 0.3 < z < 2.2$.
The selection is carried out using direct plates obtained at the ESO and UK
Schmidt Telescopes, scanned with the COSMOS facility and searched for objects
with an ultraviolet excess. Follow-up spectroscopy, carried out at ESO La
Silla, is used to classify each candidate. In this initial paper, we describe
the scientific objectives of the survey; the selection and observing techniques
used. We present the first sample of 285 QSOs ($M_B < -23$) in a 153 deg$^2$
area, covered by the six ``deep'' fields, intended to obtain significant
statistics down $B \simeq 18.75$ with unprecedented photometric accuracy. From
this database, QSO counts are determined in the magnitude range $ 17 < B <
18.75$.

Through the study of two absorption spectral features in the optical range
(Mg2 and the 4000 A break), we find evidence for star formation in the inner
regions of cooling-flow galaxies. The application of simple stellar population
models reveals that the measured indices are explained if a relatively small
fraction of the total mass flow (5-17%) is forming new stars with a normal IMF.
However, we argue that this is only a lower limit, and conclude that a large
fraction of the gas accreted inside the galaxy could be forming stars. In
addition, the analysis of line-strength gradients in the inner galaxy regions
reveals that, in the mean, they are lower than those of normal ellipticals, and
exhibit a hint of correlation with the mass accretion rate. Simultaneously, the
spectral indices in the outer regions of some galaxies, with and without
cooling flow, attain extremely low values, suggesting that they could be
hosting star formation with an origin not related to the cooling flows.

A double inflationary model provides perturbation spectra with enhanced power
at large scales (Broken Scale Invariant perturbations -- BSI), leading to a
promising scenario for the formation of cosmic structures. We describe a series
of high-resolution PM simulations with a model for the thermodynamic evolution
of baryons in which we are capable of identifying 'galaxy' halos with a
reasonable mass spectrum and following the genesis of large and super-large
scale structures. The power spectra and correlation functions of 'galaxies' are
compared with reconstructed power spectra of the CfA catalogue and the
correlation functions of the Las Campanas Deep Redshift Survey.

Lunar occultation can be used to measure the proper motions of some of the
long time scale microlensing events, $t_{e} \gsim 70$ days, now being detected
toward the Galactic bulge. The long events are difficult to explain within the
context of standard models of the mass distribution and dynamics of the Galaxy.
Han & Gould (1995b) have suggested that they may be due to a kinematically cold
population near the Sun. To resolve the mass, distance, and velocity of
individual events and so to determine their nature, one must measure parallaxes
and proper motions. For long events, parallaxes can be often obtained from
ground-based measurements, but proper motions can only rarely be determined
using conventional methods. Lunar occultations are therefore key to the
understanding of the long events. We carry out realistic simulations to
estimate the uncertainty of these measurements and show that proper motions
could be measured for about one long event per year.

The central star (CSPN) of the planetary nebula M 1-25 (PN G 4.9+4.9) is
classified as a [WC 6] star, the only CSPN of this subclass known at this time.
A comparison with the other emission-lines CSPN (the [WC]-class and the 'weak
emission-lines stars' or {\em wels}-class) shows that (1) the characteristics
of this [WC 6] star fit well inside the main properties of the other [WC] CSPN
; (2) the [WC] CSPN seem to evolve from the [WC 8-11] (latter) to [WC 2-4]
(earlier) subclasses, say from dense nebulae with cool stars to more extended
nebulae with hot nuclei, as for other CSPN ; (3) on the two-colour IRAS
diagram,the [WC] and the {\em wels} CSPN form two different groups : the
progenitors of the [WC]-type CSPN seem to be Carbon stars evolving along
post-AGB tracks, whereas the {\em wels} CSPN seem to be related to OH/IR stars,
some of them having possibly experienced a late helium-flash.

Observations of the Cosmic Microwave background have provided many of the
most powerful constraints we have on cosmology and events in the early
universe. The spectrum and isotropy of CBR have long been a pillar of Big Bang
models. The discovery of low levels on anisotropy has provided new information
and tools for our understanding of the early universe. Further observations
promise to enhance greatly our knowledge of processes in the early universe and
cosmological parameters. We can anticipate rapid advance in this field up to
and through the year 2000 which will dramatically focus our efforts in
cosmology during the next millenium. This paper outlines the primary science
likely to be discovered and defined by a vigorous airborne and ground-based
program which should be strongly supported. If successfully excuted, we an
anticipate a measurement of the CBR anisotropy spectrum to within a factor of
two of the confidence level unavoidably set by cosmic variance. Even so,
observations of the CBR are the best and often the only way to obtain
information on many critical parameters so that an ambitious satellite
experiment that maps the full-sky to the delta T/T ~ 10^{-6} level is well
justified.

We present a new measurement of the cosmic-ray positron fraction e+/(e+ + e-)
obtained from the first balloon flight of the High Energy Antimatter Telescope
(HEAT). Using a magnet spectrometer combined with a transition radiation
detector, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and time-of-flight counters we have
achieved a high degree of background rejection. Our results do not indicate a
major contribution to the positron flux from primary sources. In particular, we
see no evidence for the significant rise in the positron fraction at energies
above ~10 GeV previously reported.

A new class of geometric statistics for analyzing galaxy catalogs is
presented. {\it Filament statistics} quantify filamentarity and planarity in
large scale structure in a manner consistent with catalog visualizations. These
statistics are based on sequences of spatial links which follow local
high-density structures. From these link sequences we compute the discrete
curvature, planarity, and torsion. Filament statistics are applied to CDM and
CHDM ($\Omega_\nu = 0.3$) simulations of Klypin \etal (1995), the CfA1-like sky
catalogs of Nolthenius, Klypin and Primack (1994, 1995), and the CfA1 catalog.
For 100 Mpc periodic simulation boxes ($H_0 = 50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), we
find robust discrimination of over 4$\sigma$ (where $\sigma$ represents
resampling errors) between CHDM and CDM. The {\it reduced filament statistics}
show that CfA1 data is intermediate between CHDM and CDM, but more consistent
with the CHDM models. Filament statistics provide robust and discriminatory
shape statistics with which to test cosmological simulations of various models
against present and future redshift survey data.

The CMB anisotropy on arc second range is examined to test the power spectrum
of perturbations in the small scale region and, in particular, to estimate the
mass of dominant dark matter particles. It is shown that for the simplest
evolutionary history with standard recombination, three and four beam
observations could discriminate the mass of dark matter particles in the
interval $0.5 KeV\leq M_{DM}\leq 4 KeV$ with an antenna beam (0.5 - 0.25) arc
minute with amplitude $\approx 10^{-7}$.

Present knowledge of the distribution of the angle between major optical and
radio axes of early-type galaxies is reviewed. While brightest galaxies in
Abell clusters show a bimodal distribution of this angle, with both parallel
and vertical alignment, ellipticals in general only show a weak preference for
vertical alignment. Current plans are outlined to homogenize and largely
increase these samples using literature data together with digitized optical
Sky Surveys and the ongoing new radio surveys. The results will shed light on
both the dynamics of nearby ellipticals, as well as on a possible link between
nearby cD galaxies and powerful high-redshift radio galaxies.

A state-of-the-art review is given on the search for counterparts of
$\gamma$-ray bursts. Particular emphasis is put on the search for flaring
counterparts, i.e. emission during or shortly after the gamma-ray emission.
With BACODINE working now for nearly one year, some of the highlights of the
herewith triggered follow-up studies will be summarized.

We have analyzed the Ulysses, BATSE, and COMPTEL spectral data from the
$\gamma$-ray burst of June 22, 1992 (GB 920622). COMPTEL data reveal a hard to
soft evolution within the first pulse of the burst, while the mean hardness
ratios of the three pulses are the same. Unlike the single instrument spectra,
the composite spectrum of GB 920622 averaged over the total burst duration
ranging from 20 keV up to 10 MeV cannot be fit by a single power law. Instead,
the spectrum shows continuous curvature across the full energy range. COMPTEL
imaging and BATSE/Ulysses triangulation constrain the source location of GB
920622 to a ring sector 1.1 arcmin wide and 2 degrees long. This area has been
searched for quiescent X-ray sources using \ros survey data collected about two
years before the burst. After the optical identification of the X-ray sources
in and near the GRB location we conclude that no quiescent X-ray counterpart
candidate for GB 920622 has been found.

The majority of bright distant quasars $(z {}^{>}_{\sim} 1)$ may form in
massive mergers appearing in compact galaxy groups in/and young clusters. The
expected tests are (i) large correlation signal for medium-$z$ QSOs $(1 < z <
2)$ and (ii) direct search for quasar groups (QGs) indicating positions of
distant pre-superclusters which later will evolve to the "systems" like the
local Great Attractor or Shapley concentration. We discuss large QGs with more
than ten members within regions $\le l_{LS} \sim 100-150 \, h^{-1} Mpc$,
tracing the enhanced density regions at $z {}^{<}_{\sim} 2$. These early large
scale structures (i) provide a natural way to "bias" the distribution of Abell
clusters, and (ii) suggest that the spectrum of primordial density
perturbations is nearly flat at scales encompassing both cluster and GAs, $l =
\pi k^{-1} \in(10,100)h^{-1} Mpc: \Delta^{2}_{k} \sim k^{3}P(k) \sim
k^{\gamma}, \gamma = 1^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$.

We present IUE spectrophotometry and optical spectropolarimetry of the
ultraluminous, extreme FeII-emitting QSO IRAS 07598+6508. We find broad
absorption troughs from high- and low-ionization species, showing that this
object is a member of the class of rare low-ionization BAL QSOs. Compared with
non-BAL QSOs, the spectral energy distribution is reddened by E(B-V) sim 0.12,
and the Halpha/Hbeta ratio even more reddened with E(B - V) sim 0.45. The broad
emission lines are unpolarized. We see broad Na I lambda5892 absorption in the
unpolarized continuum, but not in the polarized continuum (at the 5-6 sigma
level). The polarized continuum rises smoothly towards shorter wavelengths with
F_lambda propto lambda{-2}. We argue that a normal QSO continuum is polarized
by scattering from a region within, or very near, the Broad Emission Line
Region (BELR). Thus there are at least three distinct light paths to the
observer: a dusty path from the BELR, a direct path traced by the unpolarized
continuum, passing through dust and low-ionization gas (NaI), and another
relatively unobscured path followed by scattered continuum. This provides
direct evidence that a BAL region and dust only partially cover the central
QSO.
  Ultraluminous AGNs, including IRAS 07598+6508, appear no more IR-luminous
than non-IRAS-selected QSOs, and have normal L(IR)/L(opt) ratios when the
optical luminosities are corrected for reddening. Reddening and BALs occur only
along some sight lines and the parent population of BALQs are `normal' QSOs.

A solution to the old Oosterhoff controversy is proposed on the basis of a
new theoretical pulsational scenario concerning RR Lyrae cluster variables
(Bono and coworkers). We show that the observed constancy of the lowest
pulsation period in both Oosterhoff type I (OoI) and Oosterhoff type II (OoII)
prototypes (M3, M15) can be easily reproduced only by assuming the canonical
evolutionary horizontal-branch luminosity levels of these Galactic globular
clusters and therefore by rejecting the Sandage period shift effect (SPSE).

The role played by velocity fields in the fragmentation of a cold medium and
in the formation of protostars is studied.
  The velocity field is modeled with a compressible turbulent flow. A
supersonic turbulent velocity field can fragment the medium into clumps of mass
smaller than a local Jeans' mass, and therefore stabilize the medium against
the formation of protostars. Based on this idea, the protostar formation
efficiency and the protostar mass distribution are determined as functions of
the following ambient parameters: average density $n_{0}$, average temperature
$T_{0}$, r.m.s. turbulent velocity $\sigma_{v,0}$ (or its Mach number
${\cal{M}}_{t}$), postshock cooling time (e.g. chemistry).
  The main results are: i) the protostar mass distribution and its dependence
on the ambient parameters are quantified; ii) the characteristic protostar mass
is $M_{J,cl}\propto n_{0}^{-1/2}T_{0}^{2} \sigma_{v,0}^{-1}$; iii) the
protostar formation efficiency $e$ is higher for larger mean density, larger
mean temperature, lower velocity dispersion on a given scale and longer
postshock cooling time (e.g. lower metallicity): $e\propto
n_{0}^{{3/2}(\beta-1)}T_{0}^{\beta -1}
\sigma_{v,0}^{-5(\beta-1)}L_{0}^{3(\beta-1)}$, where $\beta>1$ is the exponent
of the clump mass distribution; iv) the efficiency is quite sensitive to the
ambient parameters and therefore to the dynamical evolution of the star forming
system.

Recent data on the high--redshift abundance of damped Ly$\alpha$ systems are
compared with theoretical predictions for `blue' (i.e. $n>1$) Mixed Dark Matter
models. The results show that decreasing the hot component fraction
$\Omega_\nu$ and/or increasing the primordial spectral index $n$ implies an
earlier epoch of cosmic structure formation. However, we also show that varying
$\Omega_\nu$ and $n$ in these directions makes the models barely consistent
with the observed abundance of galaxy clusters. Therefore, requiring at the
same time observational constraints on damped Ly$\alpha$ systems and cluster
abundance to be satisfied represents a challenge for the Mixed Dark Matter
class of models.

We use a homogeneous sample of about 1100 rotation curves (RCs) and relative
surface photometry to investigate (out to 2 optical radii and over 6 mag) the
main mass structure properties of spirals. We confirm the strong dependence on
luminosity for both the profile and the amplitude of RCs. Spiral RCs show the
striking feature that a single parameter, the luminosity, dictates the rotation
velocity at any radius for all objects, so revealing the existence of a
universal RC. At high luminosity, there is a slight discrepancy between the
profiles of RCs and those predicted from the luminous matter (LM)
distributions: this implies a small, yet detectable, amount of dark matter
(DM). At low luminosities the failure of the LM prediction is most severe, and
DM is the only relevant mass component. Some of the derived scaling properties
between dark and luminous galactic structure parameters are: (a) the DM/LM mass
ratio at the optical radius scales inversely with luminosity; (b) the halo core
radius is comparable to the optical radius, but shrinks for lower luminosities;
(c) the central halo density scales as L^{-0.7}; (d) the halo virial mass
scales as L^{0.5}. Such scaling properties can be represented as a curve in the
luminosity-(DM/LM ratio)-(DM core radius)-(central DM density) space, which
acts as the spirals' counterpart to the FP of ellipticals.

We analyze the uncertainties in the amplitudes of the spatial correlation
functions estimated from angular correlations in a sample from the APM Galaxy
Survey, with $b_J=17-20$. We model the uncertainties in the selection function
and in the evolution of clustering. In particular we estimate $\sigma_8^{APM}$,
the rms galaxy number fluctuations in spheres of radius at $8 \Mpc$, from the
measured angular variance in the APM. The uncertainty in $\sigma_8^{APM}$ has
three main contributions: 8\% from sampling and selection function
uncertainties, 7\% from the uncertainty in the evolution of clustering and 3\%
from the uncertainty in the value of $\Omega_0$. Including all these
contributions, we find $\sigma_8^{APM}$ is in the range $0.78-1.08$. If the
galaxy clustering in the APM evolves as expected from gravitational clustering
of matter fluctuations, then $\sigma_8^{APM}=0.95 \pm 0.07$ ($1.00 \pm 0.08$)
for $\Omega_0 \simeq 1$ ($\Omega_0 \simeq 0$), close to the values for nearby
optical samples. On the other hand, if we assume that clustering evolution is
fixed in comoving coordinates $\sigma_8^{APM}=0.83 \pm 0.05$ ($0.87 \pm 0.06$),
closer to the results for nearby IRAS samples. The final uncertainty in the
range of values for the hierarchical amplitudes $S_J\equiv
\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$ is typically twice the estimated sampling errors, with
the highest values for the case of less clustering evolution. We compare our
estimates with other results and discuss the implications for models of
structure formation.

We analyse the effect of two relevant physical constraints on the mass
multiplicity function of dark matter halos in a Press--Schechter type
algorithm. Considering the random--walk of linear Gaussian density fluctuations
as a function of the smoothing scale, we simultaneously i) account for mass
semi--positivity and ii) avoid the cloud--in--cloud problem. It is shown that
the former constraint implies a severe cutoff of low--mass objects, balanced by
an increase on larger mass scales. The analysis is performed both for
scale--free power--spectra and for the standard cold dark matter model. Our
approach shows that the well--known ``infrared" divergence of the standard
Press--Schechter mass function is caused by unphysical, negative mass events
which inevitably occur in a Gaussian distribution of density fluctuations.

We investigate the final fate of metal deficient (MD) H burning Red Giants
under various assumptions about the amount of mass loss. Adopting a metallicity
Z= 10^(-8), we follow the evolution of 0.8 Mo models from the Main Sequence
phase till the onset of the He flash or the final cooling as a He White Dwarf,
according to the amount of mass loss. We show that MD Red Giants require
peculiarly large H-rich envelopes to support the H-shell burning and to allow
the final ignition of He, thus favouring the occurrence of He degenerate dwarfs
either as the result of single star evolution or in MD binary systems. The
evolution of our models along the He burning phase or as cooling White Dwarf is
briefly discussed.

If gamma-ray bursts are cosmological or in a halo distribution their
properties are expected to be isotropic (at least to 1st order). However, our
motion with respect to the burst parent population (whose proper frame is
expected to be that of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), or that of a
static halo) will cause a dipole effect in the distribution of bursts and in
their photon number counts (together termed a Compton-Getting effect). We argue
that the photon number count information is necessary to distinguish a genuine
Compton-Getting effect from some other anisotropy and to fully test the proper
frame isotropy of the bursts. Using the 2B burst catalogue and the dipole
determined from the CMB, we find the surprising result that although the number
weighted distribution is consistent with isotropy, the fluence weighted dipole
has a correlation with the CMB dipole that has a probability of occuring only
10% of the time for an isotropic photon distribution. Furthermore, the photon
and number dipoles are inconsistent under the hypothesis of isotropy, at the
2-sigma level. This could be an indication that a non-negligible fraction of
gamma-ray bursts originate in the local, anisotropic universe. (shortened
Abstract)

We investigate the injection spectrum of ultra-high-energy (>10^{15} eV)
cosmic rays under the hypotheses that (1) these cosmic rays are protons and (2)
the sources of these cosmic rays are extra-galactic and are homogeneously
distributed in space. The most puzzling aspect of the observed
ultra-high-energy cosmic ray spectrum is the apparent nonexistence of a
``Greisen cut-off'' at about 10^{19.8} eV. We show that this fact could be
naturally explained if most (or all) of the cosmic rays presently observed
above about 10^{19.6} eV were initially injected with energy above the Greisen
cut-off. However, we find that the injection of cosmic rays above the Greisen
cut-off cannot account for the observed flux below about 10^{19.6} eV unless
the injection rate of these particles was enormously higher in the past, as
would be the case if the injection resulted from the decay of an ultra-massive
particle with lifetime of order 10^{9} yr. Even with such a rapid source
evolution, the observed cosmic ray spectrum below about 10^{18.5} eV cannot be
explained in this manner. However, we show that a 1/E^3 injection spectrum can
account for the observed spectrum below 10^{18.5} eV}, with the steepening
observed by the Fly's Eye group between 10^{17.6} eV and 10^{18.5} eV being
very naturally explained by e+ - e- production effects. This latter fact lends
support to the hypothesis that the cosmic rays in this energy regime are
protons. However, due to e+ - e- production effects, a 1/E^3 injection spectrum
cannot account for the observed flux above about 10^{18.5} eV.

Images are discussed of six QSOs at z=2.3, one QSO-like IRAS source at z=2.3,
and one QSO at z=1.1, taken with resolution 0.6 to 0.9 arcsec. Five of the QSOs
are radio-quiet. All QSOs except one are just resolved, while the IRAS source
has definite structure. In some cases, part of the QSO fuzz appears to be a
close companion rather than a concentric host galaxy. The luminosities implied
for the hosts or companions are typical of bright galaxies with young hot star
populations. Radio-quiet QSOs appear to have host galaxies less luminous by ~2
magnitudes than radio-loud QSOs.

Studies of energetic particle acceleration at collisionless shocks by the
diffusive shock acceleration process indicate that completely smooth cosmic ray
dominated shock structures are possible. The existence of these is discussed
and conditions for their existence derived. It is shown that such solutions
cannot dominate the evolution of supernova remnants if the particle diffusion
coefficient has the expected strong momentum dependence

A review of the neutrino conversion and oscillations among the two neutrino
species (active and sterile) induced by strong twisting magnetic field is
presented and implications to neutrinos in neutron star, supernova, the Sun and
interstellar galactic media are discussed. The ``cross-boundary effect" (CBE)
(i.e., a possible conversion of one half of neutrinos of the bunch from active
into sterile specie) at the surface of neutron star is also studied for a
realistic neutron star structure.

The present structure of galaxies is governed by the radiative dissipation of
the gravitational and supernova energy injected during formation. A crucial
aspect of this process is whether the gas cools as fast as it falls into the
gravitational potential well. If it does then rapid normal star formation is
assumed to ensue. If not, and the gas can still cool by the present time, then
the situation resembles that of a cooling flow, such as commonly found in
clusters of galaxies. The cooled matter is assumed to accumulate as very cold
clouds and/or low mass stars, i.e. as baryonic dark matter. In this paper we
investigate the likelihood of a cooling flow phase during the hierarchical
formation of galaxies. We concentrate on the behaviour of the gas, using a
highly simplified treatment of the evolution of the dark matter potential
within which the gas evolves. We assume that normal star formation is limited
by how much gas the associated supernovae can unbind and allow the gas profile
to flatten as a consequence of supernova energy injection. We find that cooling
flows are an important phase in the formation of most galaxies with total (dark
plus luminous) masses approxgt 10^12 Msun , creating about 20 per cent of the
total dark halo in a galaxy such as our own and a smaller but comparable
fraction of an elliptical galaxy of similar mass. The onset of a cooling flow
determines the upper mass limit for the formation of a visible spheroid from
gas, setting a characteristic mass scale for normal galaxies. We argue that
disk formation requires a cooling flow phase and that dissipation in the
cooling flow phase is the most important factor in the survival of normal
galaxies during subsequent hierarchical mergers.

Though one dimensional self-gravitating $N$-body systems have been studied
for three decade, the nature of relaxation was still unclear. There were
inconsistent results about relaxation time; some initial state relaxed in the
time scale $T\sim N\,t_c$, but another state did not relax even after $T\sim
N^2\,t_c$, where $t_c$ is the crossing time. The water-bag distribution was
believed not to relax after $T\sim N^2\,t_c$. In our previous paper, however,
we found there are two different relaxation times in the water-bag
distribution;in the faster relaxation ( microscopic relaxation ) the
equipartition of energy distribution is attains but the macroscopic
distribution turns into the isothermal distribution in the later relaxation
(macroscopic relaxation). In this paper, we investigated the properties of the
two relaxation. We found that the microscopic relaxation time is $T\sim
N\,t_c$, and the macroscopic relaxation time is proportional to $N\,t_c$, thus
the water-bag does relax. We can see the inconsistency about the relaxation
times is resolved as that we see the two different aspect of relaxations.
Further, the physical mechanisms of the relaxations are presented.

We present the results of a pointed ROSAT PSPC observation of the cluster
A3558 which is part of the core of the Shapley Concentration. The X-ray
brightness distribution can be fitted as the sum of an elliptical King law,
with a major core radius of about 0.20 Mpc and an axial ratio 0.72, and a
Gaussian central source associated with the cD galaxy. Among the several
discrete sources present in the field, two correspond to the poor clusters SC
1327-312 and SC 1329-313, at about the same redshift as A3558, and two other
sources are identified with bright galaxies, which are also part of the core of
the Shapley Concentration. There is also evidence of an enhanced diffuse X-ray
emission which connects the outer part of A3558 with SC 1327-312. From the
spectral analysis, we find that the temperature profile of A3558 is consistent
with an isothermal distribution at kT=3.25 keV, while the cD galaxy has the
lower temperature kT=1.89 keV. For the cluster we derive a luminosity L_X = 1.1
X 10^44 erg/s, within a radius of 0.8 Mpc and a total mass M_tot = 3.1 X 10^14
M_\odot within an Abell radius. In the same region the gas mass is about 20% of
the total mass and there are evidences for the hot gas to be less centrally
concentrated than the dark matter and the stellar component. For h=1 most of
the dynamical mass is in dark matter, while for h=0.5 most of the mass is in
hot gas. In both cases, the stellar mass appears to be a good tracer of the
total mass distribution. Under the hypothesis that the central density spike
represents a cooling flow, we derive a mass deposition rate of 25 M_\odot/yrs.
The single physical parameters derived for A3558 show a general agreement with
the typical values found for other X-ray emitting clusters, but the
correlations between these quantities show some peculiarities, probably due to

Narrow-band emission-line and continuum images obtained in subarcsecond
seeing conditions are presented for the Seyfert~2 galaxy, Markarian 573. Images
in the emission-lines of [\oi], [\oii], [\oiii], [\sii], and \halpha+[\nii] are
used to measure the structure and excitation in the extended emission regions
surrounding the active nucleus. The biconical region contains a variety of
complex features, including two arc-like structures within $\sim 2\arcsec$ of
the active nucleus that appear to be associated with the extended radio
continuum emission in the sense that the radio lobes lie just inside the
centroids of the emission-line arcs. These arcs probably arise from an
interaction between the ISM and the radio plasma from the active nucleus. Two
other emission-line features lie $\sim3-4\arcsec$ on either side of the
nucleus, and appear to be elongated nearly perpendicular to the symmetry axis
of the inner radio and optical structures. The existence of multiple
emission-line components could be evidence for episodic ejection of radio
plasma from the active nucleus.

Modifications to polar-gap models for pulsars are discussed for the case
where the surface magnetic field, $B_\S$, of the neutron star is strong. For
$B\ga4\times10^8\rm\,T$, the curvature $\gamma$-quanta emitted tangentially to
the curved force lines of the magnetic field are captured near the threshold of
bound pair creation and are channelled along the magnetic field as bound
electron-positron pairs (positronium). The stability of such bound pairs
against ionization by the parallel electric field, $E_\parallel$, in the polar
cap, and against photoionization is discussed. Unlike free pairs, bound pairs
do not screen $E_\parallel$ near the neutron star. As a consequence, the energy
flux in highly relativistic particles and high-frequency (X-ray and/or
$\gamma$-ray) radiation from the polar gaps can be much greater than in the
absence of positronium formation. We discuss this enhancement for (a)
Arons-type models, in which particles flow freely from the surface, and find
any enhancement to be modest, and (b) Ruderman-Sutherland-type models, in which
particles are tightly bound to the surface, and find that the enhancement can
be substantial. In the latter case we argue for a self-consistent,
time-independent model in which partial screening of $E_\parallel$ maintains it
close to the threshold value for field ionization of the bound pairs, and in
which a reverse flux of accelerated particles maintains the polar cap at a
temperature such that thermionic emission supplies the particles needed for
this screening. This model applies only in a restricted range of periods,
$P_2<P<P_1$, and it implies an energy flux in high-energy particles that can
correspond to a substantial fraction of the spin-down power of the pulsar.
  Nonthermal, high-frequency radiation has been observed from six radio pulsars

Geometrical model of structure of the universe is examined to obtain
analytical expression for the two points nonlinear correlation function.
According to the model the objects (galaxies) are concentrated into two types
of structure elements - filaments and sheets. We considered the filaments (
similar to galaxy filaments ) simply as straight lines and the sheets ( similar
to superclusters of galaxies ) simply as planes. The homogeneously distributed
objects are also taken into consideration. The spatial distribution of lines,
planes and points is uncorrelated. The nonlinear correlation function depends
on four parameters and is similar to the observed and simulated ones for
different samples. It describes quite well the correlation of galaxies,
clusters of galaxies and dark matter distribution. Possible interpretation of
the parameters of nonlinear correlation function is discussed.

The generally familiar notion that the conservation of energy requires the
intensity of the radiation generated by a localized finite-duration source to
decay like the inverse square of the distance from the source is not
necessarily true. In this paper, we identify physically tenable sources of
acoustic and electromagnetic radiations the amplitudes of whose emissions to
particular distant zones decay cylindrically (like {R_P}^{-{1\over2}}) rather
than spherically (like {R_P}^{-1}) as R_P tends to infinity (R_P denotes the
distance of the observer from the source). These sources have moving
distribution patterns which are in general three-dimensional and which
propagate faster than the emitted waves. Their emission is characterized by a
waveform of constant duration that consists of a continuous assemblage of
cylindrically decaying subpulses. Each subpulse embodies a propagating caustic
and is narrower the further away it is observed from the source. The change in
the lifetime of the subpulses with range (\sim {R_P}^{-1}) is such that their
energy---but not their intensity---follows the inverse square law and the
Rayleigh distance associated with them is of the same order of magnitude as
their distance from the source (R_P) for all values of this distance.\par We
present our work in the context of the literature on the non-diffracting wave
packets known as acoustic or electromagnetic missiles, and point out how these
missiles allow the existing body of data on the emissions from supersonic jets
and propellers and from pulsars to be seen in a different light. A
supersonically convected aeroacoustic source of volumetric scale L^3 and
lifetime T radiates conventional Mach waves whose mean square
pressure-fluctuations level scales as \rho^2 U^4cTL /{R_P}^2 (\rho and U are

We present new spectroscopic observations in the Ca~{\sc ii} H \& K line
region for a sample of 28 chromospherically active binary systems (RS$~$CVn and
BY$~$Dra classes), with different activity levels. By using the spectral
subtraction technique (subtraction of a synthesized stellar spectrum
constructed from reference stars of similar spectral type and luminosity class)
we obtain the active-chromosphere contribution to the Ca~{\sc ii} H \& K lines
and to the H$\epsilon$ line when it is present. We have compared the emission
equivalent widths obtained with this technique with those obtained by
reconstruction of the absorption line profile below the emission peak(s). The
emissions arising from each individual star were obtained when it was possible
to deblend the contribution of both components. The Ca~{\sc ii} line profiles
corresponding to different seasons and orbital phases are analysed in order to
determine the contribution of each component and to study the chromospheric
activity variations.

The strenth of the tidal shear produced by the large-scale density field
acting on primordial density perturbations is calculated in power law models.
It is shown that the large-scale tidal field could, strongly affect the
morphology, orientation and angular momentum aquisition of density peaks
possibly playing a role in the formation of early-type galaxies. Evidence is
presented that the correlacion between the orientation of perturbations and the
large-scale density field could be a common property of Gaussian density fields
with spectral indexes $n < 0$. We argue that alignment of strcutures as those
detected for elliptical galaxies can be used to probe the the flatness of the
spectrum on large scales but it cannot determine the exact value of the
spectral index.

It is found that the ages of the most metal-poor Galactic globular clusters
are probably around 18 Gyr. On the other hand a Hubble parameter of 82 +/- 8
km/sec/Mpc (in conjunction with the standard Einstein-de Sitter model with an
Omega =1 and Lambda =0) yields and age of the Universe of about 8 Gyr. Some
possible reasons for this discrepancy are explored.

Because the transformation from distance to redshift is nonlinear, maps in
redshift space become increasingly distorted as the redshift z becomes greater.
As noted by Alcock \& Paczy\'nski (1979), observed redshift distortions can be
used to estimate the deceleration parameter $q_0$. If $q_0$ is greater than -1,
voids in redshift space will be elongated along the line of sight. In addition,
distant voids will have a greater volume in redshift space than nearby voids.
Accurate measurement of the volume and the axis ratio of voids, as a function
of their central redshift, will provide an estimate of $q_0$. To test this
method of estimating $q_0$, I create a two-dimensional toy universe, free of
peculiar velocities, in which the galaxies are located near the walls of
Voronoi cells. The galaxies are then mapped into redshift space, adopting
different values of $q_0$. In redshift space, I estimate the area and the axis
ratio of the voids by fitting ellipses within the voids, using an algorithm
which maximizes the area of the empty ellipses and ensures that ellipses do not
overlap. The accuracy of the estimated values of $q_0$ is limited by the
intrinsic scatter in the size and shape of the voids. In the toy universe,
distinguishing between a $q_0 = -1$ universe and a $q_0 = 1/2$ universe
requires a survey which goes to a depth z > 0.1 in redshift space. Peculiar
velocities will create an additional source of uncertainty for the values of
$q_0$ measured in N-body simulations and in the real universe.

We report the results of a search for X-ray emission from quasar host
clusters at moderate redshift using the {\sl ROSAT} HRI. We detect no emission
from the host clusters of 3C~263 (z=0.646) and PKS~2352-34 (z=0.706) to
3$\sigma$\ limits of 3.26 and 2.86 $\times$10$^{44}$\ ergs~s$^{-1}$
respectively (H$_o$=50, q$_o$=1/2) for clusters with r$_{core}$=125~kpc and
T=5~keV. These limits show that these quasar host clusters are not
substantially more X-ray luminous than optically or X-ray selected clusters of
similar richnesses at z$\gtrsim$0.5. We also report the possible detection of a
clump of X-ray emitting gas coincident with the brightest radio lobe of 3C~263.
This may be evidence for the existence of a clumpy ICM in the host cluster of
3C~263.

We present near--infrared observations of the ultraluminous high-redshift
(z=2.286) IRAS source FSC 10214+4724 obtained in 0.''4 seeing at the W. M. Keck
telescope. These observations show that FSC 10214+4724 consists of a highly
symmetric circular arc centered on a second weaker source. The arc has an
angular extent of about 140 degrees and is probably unresolved in the
transverse direction. This morphology constitutes compelling prima facie
evidence for a gravitationally lensed system. Our images also contain evidence
for the faint counter image predicted by the lens hypothesis. The morphology of
FSC 10214+4724 can be explained in terms of a gravitationally lensed background
source if the object at the center of curvature of the arc is an L* galaxy at z
~ 0.4. If FSC 10214+4724 is lensed then there is significant magnification and
its luminosity has been overestimated by a large factor. Our results suggest
FSC~10214+4724 is not a uniquely luminous object but ranks amo ng the most
powerful quasars and ultraluminous IRAS galaxies.

The pseudo-spectral method is proposed for following the evolution of density
and velocity fluctuations at the weakly non-linear stage in the expanding
universe with a good accuracy. In this method, the evolution of density and
velocity fluctuations is integrated in the Fourier Space with using FFT. This
method is very useful to investigate accurately the non-linear dynamics in the
weakly non-linear regime. Because the pseudo-spectral method works directly in
the Fourier space, it should be especially useful for examining behavior in the
Fourier domain, for an example, the effects of the non-linear coupling of
different wave modes on the evolution of the power spectrum. I show the results
of this analysis both in one and three dimensional systems.

We present a study of the intraday variability behaviour of a complete sample
of radio-selected BL Lac objects taken from the 1 Jy catalogue. In 28 out of 34
BL Lac objects (82\%) we detected intraday variability. 7 objects were observed
during several campaigns. None of them changed its variability behaviour. The
duty cycle in radio-loud BL Lac objects is very high, i.e. at least 0.8.
  The typical peak-to-peak amplitudes of the variability were 30\%. By means of
structure function and autocorrelation analyses we investigated the typical
time-scales of the variability and determined the activity of the BL Lac
objects. In 21 of the variable BL Lac objects we were able to measure a typical
time-scale, which lies in the range between 0.5 and 3 days.
  In general, the results can be explained by the standard model, where shocks
are propagating down a relativistic jet. However, in the two most densely
sampled observations we found variability characteristics, which cannot easily
be explained by the standard model alone, demonstrating that at least in these
objects alternative models should be taken into account. Nevertheless, all
models, which are able to explain variability on time-scales of days must be
able to consider the high duty cycle of these BL Lac objects.

This paper reports the results of the numerical study of the formation of
aspherical Planetary Nebulae through the Generalised Interacting Winds Model,
taking into account the effects caused by the evolving central star and fast
wind. The results show for the first time that aspherical nebulae do form
within the required time scale. Consideration of the development of the nebula
shows that in the early stages it is the ionization of the aspherical AGB wind
that contributes considerably to the shaping of the nebula. Furthermore the
passing through of the ionization front may modifies the density distribution
in the slow wind, leading to the formation of a surrounding envelope, and
sometimes a different morphology for the nebula than was to be expected from
the initial conditions. I consider how the different phases of ionization
fronts and wind swept bubbles can be observationally distinguished.

The parsec scale properties of low power radio galaxies are reviewed here,
using the available data on 12 FR I galaxies. The most frequent radio structure
is an asymmetric parsec-scale morphology, i.e. core and one-sided jet. It is
shared by 9 (possibly 10) of the 12 mapped radio galaxies. One (possibly 2) of
the other galaxies has (have) a two-sided jet emission. Two sources are known
from published data to show a proper motion; we present here evidence for
proper motion in two more galaxies. Therefore, in the present sample we have 4
radio galaxies with a measured proper motion. One of these has a very symmetric
structure and therefore should be in the plane of the sky. The results
discussed here are in agreement with the predictions of the unified scheme
models. Moreover, the present data indicate that the parsec scale structure in
low and high power radio galaxies is essentially the same.

For the first time, detailed radiative transfer calculations of Comptonized
X-ray and gamma-ray radiation in a hot pair plasma above a cold accretion disk
are performed using two independent codes and methods. The simulations include
both energy and pair balance as well as reprocessing of the X- and gamma-rays
by the cold disk. We study both plane-parallel coronae as well as active
dissipation regions having shapes of hemispheres and pill boxes located on the
disk surface. It is shown, contrary to earlier claims, that plane-parallel
coronae in pair balance have difficulties in selfconsistently reproducing the
ranges of 2-20 keV spectral slopes, high energy cutoffs, and compactnesses
inferred from observations of type 1 Seyfert galaxies. Instead, the
observations are consistent with the X-rays coming from a number of individual
active regions located on the surface of the disk.
  A number of effects such as anisotropic Compton scattering, the reflection
hump, feedback to the soft photon source by reprocessing, and an active region
in pair equilibrium all conspire to produce the observed ranges of X-ray
slopes, high energy cutoffs, and compactnesses. The spread in spectral X-ray
slopes can be due to a spread in the properties of the active regions such as
their compactnesses and their elevations above the disk surface. Simplified
models invoking isotropic Comptonization in spherical clouds are no longer
sufficient when interpreting the data.

We present spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of the X-ray luminous
cluster of galaxies, PKS0745-191, using observations made with the ASCA and
ROSAT satellites. The X-ray data measure the density, temperature, and
metallicity profiles of the cluster gas and constrain the distribution of mass
in the cluster to a radius of \sim 1.5 Mpc. We report the discovery of a bright
gravitationally-lensed arc at a redshift, z_{\rm arc} = 0.433, in the cluster.
This result identifies PKS0745 as the lowest-redshift cluster (z_{\rm clus} =
0.1028) known to exhibit gravitational lensing. The properties of the lensed
source are consistent with an S_{\rm ab} galaxy with ongoing star formation.
The projected cluster mass determined from lensing arguments is in excellent
agreement with the value measured from a multiphase analysis of the X-ray data.
This contrasts with previously-reported results for the clusters Abell 1689 and
Abell 2218, for which discrepancies of \sim a factor 2 in the lensing and X-ray
masses are observed. At both X-ray and optical wavelengths PKS0745 appears
regular and dynamically relaxed. Abell 1689 and Abell 2218 exhibit more complex
dynamical states, indicative of ongoing merger events. We suggest that merging
activity has lead to line-of-sight mass enhancements in these systems. The
X-ray spectra and images presented here confirm that PKS0745 contains one of
the largest known cooling flows, with a mass deposition rate of \sim 1000
\Msunpyr.

We introduce a model Galactic field low-mass stellar population that has a
proportion of binary systems as observed, with a mass ratio distribution
consistent with observational constraints. The model single star and system
luminosity function agrees with the nearby and the Malmquist corrected
photometric luminosity function, respectively. We tabulate the model luminosity
functions in the photometric V-, I- and K-bands, and in bolometric magnitudes.
Unresolved binary systems are thus a natural explanation for the difference
between the nearby and photometric luminosity functions. A local overdensity of
faint stars needs not be postulated to account for the difference, and is very
unlikely. We stress that the nearby luminosity function can only be used to
weakly constrain the stellar mass function below $0.5\,M_\odot$, because of the
small sample size. The photometric luminosity function can only be used to put
lower limits on the stellar mass function because most binary systems are not
resolved. However, taken together the nearby and photometric stellar luminosity
function data do not imply a mass function with a peak at a mass of
$0.2-0.3\,M_\odot$. Instead, the data are consistent with a power-law mass
function between 0.08$\,M_\odot$ and $0.5\,M_\odot$. We urge researchers to
only use star count data that are properly corrected for {\it all}
contributions to cosmic scatter, photometric uncertainties, and unresolved
binaries, and to be aware of the severe limitations of theoretical
mass--luminosity relations for low mass stars, when drawing conclusions about
structure in the stellar mass function.

We present observations at 1.7 and 8.4 GHz of two Compact Steep Spectrum
(CSS) sources from a complete sample of low-intermediate power radio galaxies.
3C346 shows an asymmetric structure with a one-sided ``jet'' and ``hot spot''.
Present observations suggest that the classification of this source as a CSS is
inappropriate, and that it is a common radio galaxy at a small angle to the
line of sight. Its properties are in agreement with the predictions of unified
schemes models. 4C31.04 shows more complex structure with the possibility of a
centrally located flat spectrum core in between two close lobes. We suggest
that this source could be a low redshift Compact Symmetric Object.

A search for millimetric continuum emission from eight optically-selected,
radio-quiet quasars and a radiogalaxy with 3.7 < z < 4.3, has been undertaken
using a highly sensitive 7-channel bolometer on the IRAM 30-m Millimetre Radio
Telescope. Detections of a potentially dust-rich quasar, and of 8C1435+635, the
most distant known radiogalaxy, are reported. An extrapolation of the
steepening centimetric radio spectrum of 8C1435+635 accounts for less than one
per cent of the observed 1.25-mm flux density, indicating that the emission is
most likely from warm dust, although the present data cannot discriminate
against synchrotron emission. If the emission is thermal, then the derived dust
mass lies in the range, 2E9 < M(dust) < 8E7 Solar for 20 < T(dust) < 100K, or
M(dust) ~ 1.6E8 Solar for T(dust) = 60K, similar to that derived for 4C41.17,
suggesting a molecular gas mass of between 4E10 and 9E11 Solar. The quasar,
PC2047+0123 at z=3.80, has no detectable centimetric emission and the 1.25-mm
continuum detected here probably also originates from ~ 1.5E8 Solar masses of
dust (again for T(dust) = 60K). Upper limits have been obtained for four
quasars, corresponding to dust mass limits of around 3 sigma < 2E8 Solar; less
useful limits have been set for a further three quasars.

How much dark matter is there in the universe and where is it located? These
are two of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. We use in this paper
optical and x-ray mass determinations of galaxies, groups, and clusters of
galaxies to suggest that most of the dark matter may reside in very large halos
around galaxies, typically extending to ~200 kpc for bright galaxies. We show
that the mass-to-light ratio of galaxy systems does not increase significantly
with linear scale beyond the very large halos suggested for individual
galaxies. Rather, the total mass of large scale systems such as groups and rich
clusters of galaxies, even superclusters, can on average be accounted for by
the total mass of their member galaxies, including their large halos (which may
be stripped-off in the dense cluster environment but still remain in the
clusters) plus the mass of the hot intracluster gas. This conclusion also
suggests that we may live in a low-density universe with Omega ~ 0.2 - 0.3.

B,V CCD frames have been used to derive surface brightness profiles for NGC
3201 out to ~18 arcmin. A total of 857 radial velocities with median precision
~1 km/s for 399 member giants have been used to trace the velocity dispersion
profile out to 32' (the approximate tidal radius from fits of single-mass,
isotropic King-Michie models to the cluster surface brightness profiles). The
median difference in radial velocity for stars on either side of an imaginary
axis moved through the cluster in 1 degree steps shows a significant maximum
amplitude of 1.22+/-0.25 km/s. We discuss possible explanations of this result,
including: (1) cluster rotation; (2) preferential stripping of stars on
prograde orbits near the limiting radius; (3) the projection of the cluster
space velocity onto the plane of the sky and (4) a slight drift in the velocity
zero point. It is difficult to identify the primary cause of the observed
velocity field structure unambiguously, and we suspect that all of the above
processes may play a role. The B,V surface brightness profiles and radial
velocities have been modeled with single- & multi-mass King-Michie models and
nonparametric techniques. The density and M/L profiles show good agreement over
1.5<R<10 pc, and both approaches suggest a steady rise in M/L with distance
from the cluster center. Due to the low cluster luminosity, we are unable to
place useful constraints on the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion profile,
though the global mass-to-light ratio is well-constrained by the models as ~2.0
+/-0.2 for the multi-mass and nonparametric models, compared to ~ 1.65 +/-0.15
for models having equal-mass stars. Our best-fit, multi-mass models have mass
function slopes of x~0.75 +/-0.25, consistent with findings that mass function
depends on the position relative to the potential of the Galaxy.

We present the first results from a near-infrared narrow-band search for
primeval galaxies (PGs) using the Keck 10~m telescope. We have targeted our
fields for three QSOs and one radio galaxy at redshifts $z = 2.28$ to $4.70$.
We selected narrow-band filters in the $K$-band centered on strong emision
lines at the redshift of the targets. We reach limiting fluxes between
$1.6\times 10^{-17}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ and $1.0\times
10^{-16}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$, and cover a total area of $\sim
4$~arcmin$^2$. At the redshifts of interest, these flux limits correspond to
typical restframe line luminosities of $\sim 10^{42} - 10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,
unobscured star formation rates of $\sim 1 - 100$ $M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, and a
sampled comoving volume of several tens of Mpc$^3$. We have found no candidate
PGs at a $2\sigma$ confidence level. We demonstrate that for moderate dust
absorption ($A_V \gsim 2^m$) in a simple dust-screen model, our preliminary
survey puts a strong constraint on intrinsic PG luminosities during an intial
burst of star formation. In the case of the QSOs, we have used PSF-subtraction
to search for the presence of faint, extended line emission surrounding these
radio-quiet AGNs. We find no evidence for extended emission down to $3.7 \times
10^{-17}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. This imposes limits on the reprocessed
fraction of the QSO continuum emission ranging between $0.02$\% and $0.29$\%;
if beaming effects are not important, then this implies similarly small
covering factors for clouds optically thick to the QSO continuum emission.

Stellar spectra derived from current multiple-object fiber-fed spectroscopic
radial-velocity surveys, of the type feasible with, among other examples,
AUTOFIB, 2dF, HYDRA, NESSIE, and the Sloan survey, differ significantly from
those traditionally used for determination of stellar abundances. The spectra
tend to be of moderate resolution (around $1\,${\AA}) and signal-to-noise ratio
(around 10-20 per resolution element), and cannot usually have reliable
continuum shapes determined over wavelength ranges in excess of a few tens of
Angstroms. Nonetheless, we have developed techniques to extract true iron
abundances and surface gravities from such spectra of G-type stars in the
4000--$5000\,${\AA} wavelength region. The theoretical basis and calibration
using synthetic spectra are described in detail in another paper. The practical
application of these techniques to observational data is given in the present
paper. We show that this method can provide true iron abundances, with an
uncertainty of less than $ 0.2$ dex over the range of metallicity found in the
Galactic thick and thin disks, from spectra obtained with fiber-fed
spectrographs.

Supernovae remnants are known to be luminous sources of infrared [FeII]
emission. By studying how the luminosity scales with age, environment and other
relevant factors, we can construct an [FeII] luminosity function for supernovae
remnants. This will enable us to predict supernovae rates in starburst galaxies
that are too distant for individual remnants to be resolved. First, however, we
require accurate luminosities for a sample of remnants of varying ages, and in
varying physical environments. As part of this project we have carried out an
initial study of a small sample of evolved (ages greater than a few thousand
years) remnants in M33. From these data we tentatively conclude that there is
evidence for the peak luminosity in the [FeII] lines of these sources to arise
in a narrow range of ages. In other respects, the M33 remnants are similar to
their galactic and Magellanic Cloud counterparts in the observed peak
luminosity. From this, and internal evidence as to the environment present in
these regions, we conclude that the luminosity of evolved remnants is only
marginally dependent on density and metallicity.

A photoelectric monitoring program has been applied, during the last four
years, to five central stars of planetary nebulae (PNNs) with strong O\,VI
$\lambda$ 3811--34 \AA \hspace{0.1mm} emission. NGC\,6905 and, marginally,
NGC\,2452, show intrinsic luminosity variations, while NGC\,7026, IC\,2003 and
NGC\,1501 have constant luminosity within a few mmag. Photometric data have
been analyzed with the best available packages for power--spectra reductions.
Both pulsators have periods and physical characteristics well encompassed by
the theoretical pulsational models relative to these stars.

We report the results of an X-ray spectral imaging observation of the
Antennae with the ROSAT PSPC. 55% of the soft X-ray flux from the system is
resolved into discrete sources, including components identified with the
galactic nuclei and large HII regions, whilst the remainder appears to be
predominantly genuinely diffuse emission from gas at a temperature ~4x10^6 K.
The morphology of the emission is unusual, combining a halo which envelopes the
galactic discs, with what appears to be a distorted, but well-collimated
bipolar outflow. We derive physical parameters for the hot gas in both diffuse
components, which are of some interest, given that the Antennae probably
represents an elliptical galaxy in the making.

The Rees-Sciama (RS) effect produces fluctuations in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) through the time-dependent gravitational potential in the
nonlinear stages of evolution. I investigate the RS effect on the CMB angular
power spectrum $C_l$ for several CDM models by combining the results of N-body
simulations with second order perturbation theory. The amplitude of the RS
fluctuations peaks at $l \sim 100-300$, where it gives $\Delta T /T \sim
10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ for a wide range of models. This is at least an order of
magnitude below the COBE normalized primary contribution. RS fluctuations could
be a dominant source of anisotropies only on subarcminute scales ($l \approx
5000$) and are below the present day observational sensitivities on all angular
scales.

We present a new treatment of two popular models for the growth of structure,
examining the X-ray emission from hot gas with allowance for spectral line
emission from various atomic species, primarily ``metals". The X-ray emission
from the bright cluster sources is not significantly changed from prior work
and, as noted earlier, shows the CDM$+\Lambda$ model (LCDM) to be consistent
but the standard, COBE normalized model (SCDM) to be inconsistent with existing
observations --- after allowance for still the considerable numerical modelling
uncertainties.
  But we find one important new result. Radiation in the softer band 0.5-1.0keV
is predominantly emitted by gas far from cluster centers (hence ``background").
This background emission dominates over the cluster emission below 1keV and
observations of it should show clear spectral signatures indicating its origin.
In particular the ``iron blend" should be seen prominantly in this spectral bin
from cosmic background hot gas at high galactic latitudes and should show
shadowing against the SMC indicating its extragalactic origin. Certain OVII
lines also provide a signature of this gas which emits a spectrum
characteristic of $10^{6.6\pm 0.6}$K gas. Recent ASCA observations of the X-ray
background tentatively indicate the presence of component with exactly the
spectral features we predict here.

The nonlinear clustering of dark matter particles in an expanding universe is
usually studied by N-body simulations. One can gain some insight into this
complex problem if simple relations between physical quantities in the linear
and nonlinear regimes can be extracted from the results of N-body simulations.
Hamilton et al. (1991) and Nityananda and Padmanabhan (1994) have made an
attempt in this direction by relating the mean relative pair velocities to the
mean correlation function in a useful manner. We investigate this relation and
other closely related issues in detail for the case of six different power
spectra: power laws with spectral indexes $n=-2,-1$, cold dark matter (CDM),
and hot dark matter models with density parameter $\Omega=1$; CDM including a
cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) with $\Omega_{CDM}=0.4$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.6$; and $n=-1$ model with $\Omega=0.1$. We find that: (i)
Power law spectra lead to self-similar evolution in an $\Omega=1$ universe.
(ii) Stable clustering does not hold in an $\Omega=1$ universe to the extent
our simulations can ascertain. (iii) Stable clustering is a better
approximation in the case of $\Omega<1$ universe in which structure formation
freezes out at some low redshift. (iv) The relation between dimensionless pair
velocity and the mean correlation function, $\bar\xi$, is only approximately
independent of the shape of the power spectrum. At the nonlinear end, the
asymptotic value of the dimensionless pair velocity decreases with increasing
small scale power, because the stable clustering assumption is not universally
true. (v) The relation between the evolved $\bar\xi$ and the linear regime
$\bar\xi$ is also not universal but shows a weak spectrum dependence. We
present simple theoretical arguments for these conclusions.

The topology of large scale structure is studied as a function of galaxy type
using the genus statistic. In hydrodynamical cosmological CDM simulations,
galaxies form on caustic surfaces (Zeldovich pancakes) then slowly drain onto
filaments and clusters. The earliest forming galaxies in the simulations
(defined as ``ellipticals") are thus seen at the present epoch preferentially
in clusters (tending toward a meatball topology), while the latest forming
galaxies (defined as ``spirals") are seen currently in a spongelike topology.
The topology is measured by the genus (= number of ``donut" holes - number of
isolated regions) of the smoothed density-contour surfaces. The measured genus
curve for all galaxies as a function of density obeys approximately the
theoretical curve expected for random-phase initial conditions, but the early
forming elliptical galaxies show a shift toward a meatball topology relative to
the late forming spirals. Simulations using standard biasing schemes fail to
show such an effect. Large observational samples separated by galaxy type could
be used to test for this effect.

The number of close pairs of galaxies observed to faint magnitude limits,
when compared to nearby samples, determines the interaction or merger rate as a
function of redshift. The prevalence of mergers at intermediate redshifts is
fundamental to understanding how galaxies evolve and the relative population of
galaxy types. Mergers have been used to explain the excess of galaxies in faint
blue counts above the numbers expected from no-evolution models. Using deep
CFHT ($I\leq24$) imaging of a ``blank'' field we find a pair fraction which is
consistent with the galaxies in our sample being randomly distributed with no
significant excess of ``physical'' close pairs. This is contrary to the pair
fraction of $34\%\pm9\%$ found by Burkey {\it et al.} for similar magnitude
limits and using an identical approach to the pair analysis. Various reasons
for this discrepancy are discussed. Colors and morphologies of our close pairs
are consistent with the bulk of them being random superpositions although, as
indicators of interaction, these criteria are uncertain due to contamination of
field galaxies and difficulty in seeing structure at intermediate redshifts,
respectively. This observed lack of close pairs is probably linked with the
decreasing amplitude of the angular correlation function at faint limits. If
our faint samples are comprised of galaxies which have a higher average
redshift than brighter samples studied by other workers then either the merger
rate has been overestimated or there is a change in its behaviour from what is
observed at brighter magnitude limits.

Optical/infrared photometry can double the number of proper motion
measurements of Massive Compact Objects (MACHOs) relative to single band
photometry. The proper motion of a MACHO can be measured by finding the ratio
$q$ of the (known) radius of the source star to the Einstein radius of the
MACHO, $q=\theta_s/\theta_e$. A classic method for doing this is to look for
the effect on the light curve of the finite size of the source. A modification
of this method proposed by Witt (1995) is to look for color changes in the
light curve due to the fact that the limb darkening of the source is different
in different bands. We demonstrate that the ``classical'' method is not
feasible unless the MACHO actually transits the source: if the MACHO passes at
say 1.5 source radii, there is still a sizable $\sim 5\%$ effect, but the light
curve cannot be distinguished from point-source light curves with different
parameters. However, color measurements in $V$ $(0.55\,\mu$m) and $H$
$(1.65\,\mu$m) reduce the errors by a factor $\sim 120$ and permit proper
motion measurements at impact parameters of up to 2 source radii. Color maps in
$V-H$ are also useful in the detection of planetary systems. Giant stars have a
``red ring'' in such maps. A planet which transits this ring gives rise to a
distinctive signature which can help in the measurement of the planetary
system's proper motion.

Interest among astronomers in the detection of extra-solar planets is
accelerating with the growing realization that it may soon be technically
feasible. The ongoing renaissance in telescope construction and the anticipated
launches of new space platforms are encouraging many scientists to review and
improve the means by which planets can be discovered. The direct detection of
the light from a distant planet would be the most compelling means of discovery
and to gauge the feasibility of various search strategies, astronomers have
traditionally used the current Jupiter as a benchmark planet. However, in
principle, extra-solar giant planets (EGPs) can have a wide range of masses
and, hence, can be significantly brighter than Jupiter. Furthermore, the
maximum mass a planet can have is not known a priori, and observations will be
needed to determine it. We predict the optical and infrared fluxes of EGPs with
masses from 0.3 through 15 Jupiter masses and ages from 10$^7$ through $5
\times 10^{9}$ years that searches in the next few years may reveal.

We have found an effective fueling process to a central region of galaxies
with weak bar-like distortion by two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations.
Gravitational instability of an elongated gas ring at the inner Lindblad
resonance (ILR), which has been reported as an effective fueling mechanism, are
not needed for this fueling process. A massive gaseous disk in a central region
of galaxies sensitively responds to the weakly distorted potential, and a large
amount of gas can be fed into within $1/20$ of a core radius of the potential
in several $10^7$ yr. The ILRs, the dissipative nature of the gas, and
self-gravity of the gas are essential for triggering this effective fueling.
The accumulation process has not been ever known: the gas accumulates to form a
dense `linear' structure inclined at about 45 degree with respect to the bar
potential in a {\it leading sense}. We also found that a counter rotating
gaseous core can be formed as a result of the fueling. The sense of the
rotation of the core depends on a fraction of the gas mass to the background
mass. Physical mechanism of the fueling process can be understood using a
linear theory of gaseous orbits in a weak barred potential.

It is now believed that pulsars comprise the fastest population of stars in
the galaxy. With inferred mean, root-mean-square, and maximum 3-D pulsar speeds
of $\sim$300-500 km/s, $\sim$500 km/s, and $\sim$2000 km/s, respectively, the
question of the origin of such singular proper motions becomes acute. What
mechanism can account for speeds that range from zero to twice the galactic
escape velocity? We speculate that a major vector component of a neutron star's
proper motion comes from the hydrodynamic recoil of the nascent neutron star
during the supernova explosion in which it is born. Recently, theorists have
shown that asymmetries and instabilities are a natural aspect of supernova
dynamics. In this paper, we highlight two phenomena: 1) the ``Brownian-like''
stochastic motion of the core in response to the convective ``boiling'' of the
mantle of the protoneutron star during the post-bounce, pre-explosion accretion
phase, and 2) the asymmetrical bounce and explosion of an aspherically
collapsing Chandrasekhar core.In principle,either phenomenon can leave the
young neutron star with a speed of hundreds of kilometers per second.

We have performed Monte Carlo calculations of gamma-ray transport in models
of the clumpy debris cloud of the LMC supernova, SN1987A, to study the
influence of composition mixing and heterogeneity on its emergent gamma-ray and
X-ray fluxes. In particular, we have focused on the problematic Ginga band (16
-- 28 keV) flux at day 600, whose measured value was an order of magnitude
higher than predicted by previous theory. We find that the hydrogen of the
envelope could not have been intimately mixed with the heavy elements of the
core and that the hydrogen/helium volume filling factor interior to 4000 km/s
must have been large ($\ge 40\%$). A physical separation of the scattering
region and the regions occupied by the high-Z elements is required. The 600-day
models that best fit both the line data at 847 keV and 1238 keV and the
measured Ginga band fluxes suggest that as much as 50\% of the explosively
produced $^{56}$Ni stayed interior to 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and 2 M$_\odot$. The
$^{56}$Ni may have been more centrally-concentrated than in the benchmark
models. $^{56}$Ni filling factors greater than 60\% are not preferred, since
such models are too good at absorbing photons below 100 keV. Furthermore, a
total envelope mass between 10 $\mdot$ and 15 $\mdot$ is favored.

Recent novel observations have probed the baryonic fraction of the galactic
dark matter that has eluded astronomers for decades. Late in 1993, the MACHO
and EROS collaborations announced in this journal the detection of transient
and achromatic brightenings of a handful of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud
that are best interpreted as gravitational microlensing by low-mass foreground
objects (MACHOS). This tantalized astronomers, for it implied that the
population of cool, compact objects these lenses represent could be the elusive
dark matter of our galactic halo. A year later in 1994, Sackett et al. reported
the discovery of a red halo in the galaxy NGC 5907 that seems to follow the
inferred radial distribution of its dark matter. This suggested that dwarf
stars could constitute its missing component. Since NGC 5907 is similar to the
Milky Way in type and radius, some surmised that the solution of the galactic
dark matter problem was an abundance of ordinary low-mass stars. Now Bahcall et
al., using the Wide-Field Camera of the recently repaired Hubble Space
Telescope, have dashed this hope.

Fresh insights and powerful numerical tools are revitalizing the theoretical
exploration of the supernova mechanism. The realization that the protoneutron
star is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at various times and radii and, hence, that a
multi-dimensional perspective is required is one agent of this revolution.
However, a new physical understanding of the nature of explosions (even
spherical explosions) that are driven by neutrino heating and that escape from
deep within a gravitational potential well is also emerging. This, together
with the new multi-dimensional approach, promises to establish a paradigm
within which supernova explosions and their consequences can be studied in the
future.

We investigate in this paper the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism
in both one and two dimensions. We verify the usefulness of neutrino-driven
overturn (``convection'') between the shock and the neutrinosphere in igniting
the supernova explosion. The 2-D simulation of the core of a 15$\mdot$ star
that we present here indicates that the breaking of spherical symmetry may be
central to the explosion itself and that a multitude of bent and broken fingers
is a common feature of the ejecta. In 2-D, the steady-state shock radius is
larger than its value in 1-D by 30\%--100\%. The critical condition for
explosion is thereby relaxed. Since supernovae are driven by neutrino heating,
they are coronal phenomena, akin to winds, though initially bounded by an
accretion tamp. Neutrino energy is pumped into the supernova during the shock's
propagation through the inner many thousands of kilometers and not
instantaneously. Curiously, just after the explosion is triggered, the matter
that will eventually be ejected is still bound. The high-speed fingers that
emerge from the core seem a natural explanation for the nickel bullets seen in
87A and the shrapnel inferred in some supernova remnants. Within 100 ms of the
explosion, a strong, neutrino-driven wind is blowing outward from the
protoneutron star.

We investigate the configurations consisting of massive, dense and hot tori
around stellar mass Kerr black holes as possible sources of energy for the
gamma ray bursts in cosmological hypothesis of their origin. We limit
parameters of our models to the values resulting from neutron stars merger
calculations or suggested in the ``failed supernova'' scenario. We investigate
models with different angular momentum distributions and different specific
entropies. We construct also approximate evolutionary tracks of our systems
postulating some viscosity mechanism to be present. We find, that models
resulting from a merger of two neutron stars give too little energy to be
likely sources of gamma ray bursts. This conclusion remains true despite the
artificially high values of specific entropy and viscosity, which we use in our
calculations. The promising models should contain a high angular momentum black
hole ($a \sim 1$) and/or a torus with almost constant specific angular
momentum. The configurations resulting from a collapse of rapidly rotating WR
stars are not excluded as sources of the bursts due to a greater freedom in
choosing their initial parameters.

The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on
orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random
pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from
the centers of many AGN is obscured by optically thick circumnuclear matter and
in radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit light that is
relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and
magnitude of radiation anisotropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes
of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise
to different classes through different orientations.
  This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which include radio
galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and properties
of AGN and summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission. We outline the two
most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking quasars and
luminous radio galaxies and another linking BL~Lac objects and less luminous
radio galaxies. Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by
relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in
accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between
low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN. We review potential difficulties with
unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We
discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic
physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more
comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude
with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this
field.

We have used the data from the COBE satellite to search for delayed microwave
emission (31 - 90 GHz) from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The large $7^\circ$ beam
of COBE is well matched to the large positional uncertainties in the GRB
locations, although it also means that fluxes from (point source) GRB objects
will be diluted. In view of this we are doing a statistical search of the GRBs
which occurred during the currently released COBE DMR data (years 1990 and
1991), which overlap $\sim 200$ GRBs recorded by GRO. Here we concentrate on
just the top 10 GRBs (in peak counts/second). We obtain the limits on the
emission by comparing the COBE fluxes before and after the GRB at the GRB
location. Since it is thought that the microwave emission should lag the GRB
event, we have searched the GRB position for emission in the few months
following the GRB occurrence.

Using data from the ROSAT Wide Field Camera all-sky survey, we have
established upper limits to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux from a sample of
30 bright, nearby, non-active spiral galaxies. These galaxies were chosen to be
those most likely to be detected in the EUV on the basis of (i) low
interstellar absorption within our own galaxy, (ii) brightness in other
wavebands, (iii) high star formation activity, and (iv) proximity. The derived
EUV upper limits are restrictive, and establish that the EUV flux escaping from
galaxies does not contribute a major component of their bolometric luminosity,
and in particular that it is very unlikely to be the sink for the energy
injected into the interstellar medium by supernova explosions, as had been
suggested following the failure to detect this power in the X-ray band.

We have observed an outburst of the T Tauri star EX Lup in March 1994. We
present both photometric (BVR) and spectroscopic (low and medium resolution)
observations carried out during the decline after outburst. The star appears
much bluer during outburst due to an increased emission of a hot continuum.
This is accompanied by a strong increase of the veiling of photospheric lines.
We observe inverse P Cygni profiles of many emission lines over a large
brightness range of EX Lup. We briefly discuss these features towards the model
of magnetospherically supported accretion of disk material.

We show how the results given by several authors relatively to the mass of a
density peak are changed when small scale substructure induced by dynamical
friction are taken into account. The peak mass obtained is compared to the
result of Peacock \& Heavens (1990) and to the peak mass when dynamical
friction is absent to show how these effects conspire to reduce the mass
accreted by the peak.

The universe is nearly isotropic on very large scales. It is much more
difficult to show that the universe is radially homogeneous (independent of
distance), or equivalently, that it is isotropic about distant points. This
taken as an axiom, since if it were not true, then we would occupy a preferred
position. This paper considers several empirical arguments for radial
homogeneity based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The tightest limits
on inhomogeneity on the scale of the horizon are of order ten percent but will
improve soon. These limits involve the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of
galaxies, excitation of low-energy atomic transitions, and the accurately
thermal spectrum of the CMB. Weaker limits from primordial nucleosynthesis are
discussed briefly.

We investigate the universality of the globular cluster luminosity function
(GCLF) and the use of this function as an extragalactic distance indicator.
Previous studies have found an offset between GCLF distances and those obtained
with other techniques. We show that this offset can be understood in terms of a
metallicity effect. Specifically, the globular cluster systems used in distance
scale studies have traditionally been those around elliptical galaxies. These
systems have higher mean metallicities than the Milky Way globular cluster
system. Consequently, the peak of the GCLF in the systems around ellipticals is
significantly fainter in $B$ and $V$ than the GCLF peak in the Milky Way. We
calculate the shift in the peak of the GCLF relative to the Milky Way globulars
in $B$, $V$, $R$, $I$ and $J$ for a range of globular cluster metallicities.
Applying these corrections, we find good agreement between GCLF distances and
those obtained using the surface brightness fluctuations method. The similarity
between metallicity-corrected GCLFs suggests that the underlying mass function
of globular cluster systems is remarkably constant from one galaxy to another.
Our results allow the GCLF to be employed as an improved distance indicator.

COSMICS is a package of fortran programs useful for computing transfer
functions and microwave background anisotropy for cosmological models, and for
generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation
simulations of such models. Four programs are provided: {\bf linger\_con} and
{\bf linger\_syn} integrate the linearized equations of general relativity,
matter, and radiation in conformal Newtonian and synchronous gauge,
respectively; {\bf deltat} integrates the photon transfer functions computed by
the linger codes to produce photon anisotropy power spectra; and {\bf grafic}
tabulates normalized matter power spectra and produces constrained or
unconstrained samples of the matter density field.
  Version 1.0 of COSMICS is available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics/ . The
current release gives fortran-77 programs that run on workstations and
vectorized supercomputers. Unix makefiles are included that make it simple to
build and test the package. A future release will include portable parallel
versions of the linger codes using standard message-passing libraries.

We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the constellation of
Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is the nearest galaxy known, subtends
an angle of $> 10$ degrees on the sky, lies at a distance of $24 \kpc$ from the
Sun, $\sim 16 \kpc$ from the centre of the Milky Way. Itis comparable in size
and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, has a well populated red
horizontal branch with a blue HB extension; a substantial carbon star
population; and a strong intermediate age stellar component with evidence of a
metallicity spread. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly elongated along a
direction pointing towards the Galactic centre and suggest that it has been
tidally distorted. The close proximity to the Galactic centre, the
morphological appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km/s indicate that this
system must have undergone at most very few close orbital encounters with the
Milky Way. It is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being
integrated into the Galaxy. Probably all of the four globular clusters, M54,
Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and
will probably share the fate of their progenitor.

\noindent The galaxy IRAS F10214+4724, discovered in a spectroscopic survey
of a 0.2 Jy sample by Rowan-Robinson and collaborators in 1991, is
significantly more luminous than any other known galaxy. Its bolometric
luminosity is comparable to those of the most luminous quasars. Recent
obsservations have revealed a candidate foreground group of galaxies, which
might gravitationally lens F10214+4724, thus explaining much of its luminosity.
High-resolution imaging of F10214+4724 has revealed that most of its near-IR
flux comes from a circularly symmetric arc; this also supports the
gravitational lens interpretation. In such a scenario, F10214+4724 would be the
high-redshift analogue of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies observed locally.
This work presents a simple statistical lensing model to investigate this
possibility.

We use Monte Carlo realizations of halo formation histories and a spherical
accretion model to calculate the expected scatter in the velocity dispersions
of galactic halos of a given mass due to differences in their formation times.
Assuming that the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is determined by the
velocity dispersion of its halo and that its luminosity is related to its total
baryonic mass, this scatter translates to a minimum intrinsic scatter in the
Tully-Fisher relation. For popular cosmological models we find that the scatter
due to variations in formation histories is by itself greater than allowed by
observations. Unless halos of spiral galaxies formed at high redshift (z>1) and
did not later accrete any significant amount of mass, the Tully-Fisher relation
is not likely to be the direct result of cosmological initial conditions but
rather a consequence of a subsequent feedback process.

We present constraints on decaying-particle models in which an enhanced
relativistic density allows an $\Omega=1$ Cold Dark Matter universe to be
reconciled with acceptable values for the Hubble constant. Such models may
contain extra small-scale power, which can have important consequences for
enhanced object formation at high redshifts. Small-scale galaxy clustering and
abundances of high-redshift damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption clouds give a
preferred range for the mass of any such decaying particle of 2 to 30 keV and a
lifetime of 0.5 to 100 years for models with a high Hubble constant ($h>0.75$).
A lower Hubble constant, $h \simeq 0.5$, weakens the constraint to $0.5< m <
30$ keV, $0.2 < \tau < 500$ years. In permitted versions of the model,
reionization occurs at redshifts $\sim 10-200$, and this feature may be of
importance in understanding degree-scale CMB anisotropies.

The rate at which particles are accelerated by the first-order Fermi
mechanism in shocks depends on the angle, \teq{\Tbone}, that the upstream
magnetic field makes with the shock normal. The greater the obliquity the
greater the rate, and in quasi-perpendicular shocks rates can be hundreds of
times higher than those seen in parallel shocks. In many circumstances
pertaining to evolving shocks (\eg, supernova blast waves and interplanetary
traveling shocks), high acceleration rates imply high maximum particle energies
and obliquity effects may have important astrophysical consequences. However,
as is demonstrated here, the efficiency for injecting thermal particles into
the acceleration mechanism also depends strongly on obliquity and, in general,
varies inversely with \teq{\Tbone}. The degree of turbulence and the resulting
cross-field diffusion strongly influences both injection efficiency and
acceleration rates. The test particle \mc simulation of shock acceleration used
here assumes large-angle scattering, computes particle orbits exactly in
shocked, laminar, non-relativistic flows, and calculates the injection
efficiency as a function of obliquity, Mach number, and degree of turbulence.
We find that turbulence must be quite strong for high Mach number, highly
oblique shocks to inject significant numbers of thermal particles and that only
modest gains in acceleration rates can be expected for strong oblique shocks
over parallel ones if the only source of seed particles is the thermal
background.

Deep imaging and spectroscopy have been carried out for optical counterparts
of a complete sample of S$>$16 $\mu$Jy radiosources during the course of the
Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS). All 36 sources but two have been
optically identified, and spectra have been obtained for 23 of them. The
objects brighter than $I_{AB}<$22.5 for which we have spectra reveal three
populations dominating the $\mu$Jy radio counts: z$>$0.7 early-type galaxies
with radio emission powered by an AGN, intermediate redshift post-starburst
galaxies, and lower redshift blue emission-line objects. From their radio and
optical properties, it is argued that the 11 objects fainter than $I_{AB}>$22.5
are mostly at z$>$1, and one half of them are probably early-type galaxies. We
conclude that $\sim$40 per cent of the $\mu$Jy sources are likely to be at z
$>$1. Between one third and one half of the luminous ellipticals in this field
beyond z = 0.7 show moderately powerful radio emission (P $\sim$ 5 10$^{23}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$) which is at least 10 times more powerful than seen in local samples,
and probably reflects evolution of the activity in their nuclei. Only one
classical starburst galaxy is identified in the sample; the rest of the blue
emission-line objects show optical and radio activity more typical of low power
AGNs than starbursts. The number of post-starbursts at $\mu$Jy levels is
considerably higher than the surface density of mJy starburst galaxies,
suggesting the latter are the parent population of the former. While starburst
galaxies are considered to be major contributors to the mJy radiosources
counts, the majority of the $\mu$Jy radio sources appear to be related to AGN
activity rather than to normal star

Powerful extended radio galaxies like Cygnus A can be used for cosmological
tests. The characteristic, time-independent length $D_*$ for several radio
sources is calculated and compared to the average physical length for a sample
of radio galaxies. The ratio of these two lengths as a function of redshift is
used to constrain cosmological parameters. Cygnus A is the only low-redshift
($z<0.5$) radio galaxy for which we have an estimate for $D_*$. We comment on
the sensitivity to this one low-redshift point, and results including and
excluding Cygnus A are shown. A low density universe is favored, and the one
free model parameter is relatively well constrained.

We investigate the global stability of a differentially rotating fluid shell
threaded by vertical and azimuthal magnetic fields to linear, axisymmetric
perturbations. This system, which models a thick accretion disk in the vicinity
of its midplane, is susceptible to the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar (VC) instability
in the absence of the azimuthal field. In most cases, the azimuthal field tends
to stabilize the VC instability, although strong fields (Alfv\'en speed of
order the characteristic rotational speed in our incompressible model) are
required for complete stabilization. Stability diagrams are constructed,
indicating critical values of the two fields for instability. We find an
additional strong field instability that arises when the azimuthal Alfv\'en
speed exceeds the characteristic rotational speed. This instability, in the
case of a freely bounded configuration, has certain similarities to the sausage
instability for interpenetrating fields in plasma physics, and may be important
for very massive disks or filamentary molecular clouds. An application to the
L1641 region in Orion A is briefly discussed. Finally, we find that the effect
of a radially varying vertical field (without an azimuthal field) is mainly
stabilizing.

We report on deep photometry and spectroscopy of the objects detected in the
ROSAT HRI X-ray error box of the hard X-ray transient, GRS 1915+105. The
probable counterpart of this source has been detected, with a magnitude of 23.4
in the I band. The optical absorption ${\rm A}_{\rm V} = 28$ derived from the
X-ray data implies an absolute magnitude in the I band, ${\rm M}_{\rm I}
\approx -6.7$. We present the data for all the objects present in the error
box, together with the spectra of the three brightest. Possible spectral types,
as well as estimates of the hydrogen column density are derived.

UHECRs are roughly isotropic and attain very large energies, $E \gtrsim
3\times 10^{20} \; eV$. Conventional models fail to explain both facts. I show
here that acceleration of UHECRs in GRBs satisfies both observational
constraints. Using M\'esz\'aros and Rees' (1994) model of GRBs as due to
hyperrelativistic shocks, I show that the highest energies that can be attained
thusly are $E\simeq 10^{20}\;\theta^{-5/3} n_1^{-5/6}\; eV$, explaining the
energy of the Bird \etal\/ (1995) event even without beaming. The traditional
photopion catastrophe affecting UHECR acceleration in AGNs is circumvented. An
order of magnitude estimate shows that the total energy flux of UHECRs at the
Earth is also correctly reproduced. A test of the model based upon the UHECRs'
distribution upon the plane of the sky is briefly discussed.

We derive analytical expressions for the change in the orbital eccentricity
of a binary following a distant encounter with a third star on a hyperbolic or
parabolic orbit. To establish the accuracy of these expressions, we present
detailed comparisons with the results of direct numerical integrations of the
equations of motion for the three bodies. We treat with particular care the
difficult case of a binary with zero initial eccentricity. In this case, we
show that the eccentricity $\delta e$ induced by the encounter declines in
general as a power-law, $\delta e\propto (a/\rp)^{5/2}$, where $a$ is the
binary semi-major axis and $\rp$ is the periastron distance of the encounter.
This power-law arises from the octupole-level secular perturbation of the
binary. In contrast, non-secular quadrupole-level perturbations induce an
eccentricity change that declines exponentially with $\rp$. These non-secular
effects can become dominant at sufficiently small $\rp$, for a sufficiently
high relative velocity, or for a sufficiently massive perturber. We also derive
cross sections for eccentricity change and compare our results with those of
previous studies based on numerical scattering experiments. Our results have
important implications for a number of astrophysical problems including, in
particular, the evolution of binary millisecond pulsars in globular clusters.

Galaxy merging is the late time manifestation of the galaxy formation process
and likely significantly effects $z<1$ galaxies. A ``maximum reasonable rate''
model for merging finds a $\sim2$ mag K band increase in the luminosities of
dwarf galaxies so that they contribute significantly to the faint counts, with
spirals and ellipticals being far less affected. The median $K$ and $I$
redshifts stabilize (and even decrease slightly) at $z\simeq0.6$ beyond I=21 or
K=19. The B redshifts continue to rise (although strongly dependent on the UV
spectral evolution). Such rapid merging predicts that at $z=1$ the
characteristic galaxy mass is reduced to $\sim30\%$ of the $z=0$ value. To rule
out this model requires good sampling beyond $z=1$.
  A theoretical complication for even a minimal merger rate, which reduces
$z=1$ masses to 2/3 of current epoch values, is that infall of a single
satellite having 10\% of a disk's mass may destroy thin disks. Using completely
self-consistent n-body simulations, we show that the primary response of a disk
to ``cosmological'' satellites up to 20\% of the disk mass is to {\em tilt} the
disk with a temporary warping.

This paper was presented at the Institute for Mathematics and its
Applications workshop "Inverse problems in wave propagation" and will appear in
the series IMA volumes (Springer). A brief overview of applications of
inversions within astronomy is presented and also an inventory of techniques
commonly in use. Most of this paper is focussed on the method of Subtractive
Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA) which is an adaptation of the Backus and
Gilbert method. This method was originally developed for use in helioseismology
where the Backus and Gilbert method is computationally too slow. Since then it
has also been applied to the problem of reverberation mapping of active
galactic nuclei and the differences between this inverse problem and the ones
of helioseismology are also discussed.

We present high-resolution CCD images (FWHM=0.6"-0.7") of the compact
gravitational lens system B0218+35.7 obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope.
Using aperture and PSF photometry we detect the two closely separated (335 mas)
components A and B as well as the lensing galaxy. In the optical B seems to be
very much brighter than A, opposite to the radio morphology. This suggests that
most of the light from A is absorbed in the lensing galaxy, possibly by a giant
molecular cloud located in the line-of-sight to component A. The lensing galaxy
appears to be a late-type galaxy at a small inclination. For future variability
studies we present calibrated photometry of the system and its immediate
surroundings, even though the relative faintness of A will make it difficult to
obtain an optical time delay even with the Hubble Space Telescope.

We present a detailed re-analysis of the two {\it ASCA} Performance
Verification observations of the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15.
Confirming the results of Fabian et al. (1994), we find definite evidence for
the {\sc O\,vii} and {\sc O\,viii} K-shell absorption edges of the warm
absorber and a doubling of the warm absorber column density within the 3 weeks
separating the two observations. No intra-day {\it flux-correlated} variability
of the warm absorber is found. However, we report the discovery of an `event'
in which the warm absorber parameters temporarily change for
\sim10\,000\thinspace s before returning to their original values. Possible
interpretations are discussed but a contradiction remains: the constancy of the
ionization state of the warm absorber argues that it lies at large distances
from the central source whereas the short term change in column density argues
for small distances. Fluorescent iron emission is examined. As found by Fabian
et al. (1994), the iron line is broad and strong (equivalent width
\sim300\thinspace eV). The line profile is also suggestive of it being skewed.
Such a line would be expected from a relativistic accretion disk. We also find
very rapid primary X-ray variability. Assuming relativistic beaming to be
unimportant, the derived efficiency is comparable to the maximum obtainable
from accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole. Correlated variability outside
of the energy range of {\it ASCA} might exceed this maximum, thus requiring
efficient accretion onto a Kerr hole.

We have identified the ROSAT source RX J0039.2-5117 with the previously
almost unknown `narrow line' Seyfert 1 galaxy WPVS007 (z=0.028). The X-ray
source displays quite unusual properties for an AGN. It was bright and
ultrasoft in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and found at a level lower by a
factor of ~ 400 in PSPC count rate in 1993. The implied 0.1-2.4 keV luminosity
during the RASS was ~ 10^{37} W. We discuss possible explanations for the
extremely soft X-ray spectrum and the observed variability.

The two-year COBE-DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps, in both galactic and ecliptic
coordinates, are used to determine the normalisation of inflationary universe
models with a flat global geometry and adiabatic density perturbations. The
appropriately normalised cold and mixed dark matter models and cosmological
constant dominated, cold dark matter models, computed for a range of values of
Omega_b and h, are then compared to various measures of structure in the
universe. Critical density CDM models appear to be irreconcilable with
observations on both large and small scales simultaneously, whereas MDM models
provide a somewhat better fit to the data. Although the COBE-DMR data alone
prefer a nearly critical value for the total density, low-density cosmological
constant models with Omega_0 greater than or equal to 0.15 can not be rejected
at a confidence level exceeding 95%. Such models may also provide a
significantly better fit to the matter distribution data than critical density
CDM.

The extreme bolometric luminosity of IRAS F10214+4724, and in particular the
huge mass in molecular gas inferred from the CO line fluxes have led to
suggestions that this is a giant galaxy in the process of formation. An
arc-like structure and the closeness of a second object suggest, however, that
gravitational lensing may be responsible for its anomalously high luminosity
and mass. In this paper, we use an optical spectrum taken in conditions of
0.7-arcsec seeing to provide further evidence that F10214+4724 is a
gravitationally lensed system. We measure tentative redshifts of 0.896 and
0.899 for galaxies projected $\approx 1$ and $\approx 3$ arcsec from IRAS
F10214+4724 respectively. Identifying the former as the lensing galaxy we
obtain a mass:light ratio consistent with those derived for other lenses, and
find that its luminosity is consistent with the velocity dispersion deduced
from the radius of the Einstein ring. If lensed, our models suggest
magnification by a factor $\sim 10$, and hence an intrinsic bolometric
luminosity for F10214+4724 similar to local ULIRGs.

Using ASCA data, we have measured the electron temperature in A2163 out to
1.5h^{-1} Mpc (10a_x) from the center, in three radial bins. The temperatures
are 12.2+1.9-1.2 keV, 11.5+2.7-2.9 keV and 3.8+1.1-0.9 keV (90%) in the 0-3 a_x
(0-3.5'), 3-6 a_x and 6-13 a_x spherical shells, respectively. Applying the
hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry assumptions and using these data
together with the Ginga spectral and the Rosat imaging data, we were able to
severely limit the possible binding mass distribution of the generic form
rho=rho_0 (1+r^2/a_b^2)^{-n/2}. All the allowed binding mass profiles are
steeper than the gas density profiles and mass profiles with the same slope as
gas are excluded at a greater than 99% confidence. The total mass inside
0.5h^{-1} Mpc is 4.3+-0.5 10^14 h^{-1} Msun, of which 0.074 h^{-3/2} is gas
while inside 1.5h^{-1} Mpc the mass is 1.07+-0.13 10^15 h^{-1} Msun.
  We note that in the cluster outer part, the timescale for electron-ion
temperature equlibration is comparable to the merger timescale, so the measured
electron temperature may give an underestimate of the gas pressure there.
Otherwise, if our low temperature is indeed representative of the gas
temperature in the outer shell, the cluster atmosphere should be convectionally
unstable and gas turbulence should exist. Bulk motions of the gas are also
expected during the merger. Their existense would increase the total gas
pressure above that indicated by the observed temperature. Thus, failure of the
"gas follows dark matter" model, favored by hydrodynamic simulations, may be
due to the neglect of these phenomena, leading to an underestimate of the total
density at large radii.

Motivated by recent developments in inflationary cosmology indicating the
possibility of obtaining genuinely open universes in some models, we compare
the predictions of cold dark matter (CDM) models in open universes with a
variety of observational information. The spectrum of the primordial curvature
perturbation is taken to be scale invariant (spectral index $n=1$),
corresponding to a flat inflationary potential. We allow arbitrary variation of
the density parameter $\Omega_0$ and the Hubble parameter $h$, and take full
account of the baryon content assuming standard nucleosynthesis. We normalize
the power spectrum using the recent analysis of the two year {\it COBE} DMR
data by G\'{o}rski et al. We then consider a variety of observations, namely
the galaxy correlation function, bulk flows, the abundance of galaxy clusters
and the abundance of damped Lyman alpha systems. For the last two of these, we
provide a new treatment appropriate to open universes. We find that, if one
allows an arbitrary $h$, then a good fit is available for any $\Omega_0$
greater than 0.35, though for $\Omega_0$ close to 1 the required $h$ is
alarmingly low. Models with $\Omega_0 < 0.35$ seem unable to fit observations
while keeping the universe over $10$ Gyr old; this limit is somewhat higher
than that appearing in the literature thus far. If one assumes a value of $h >
0.6$, as favoured by recent measurements, concordance with the data is only
possible for the narrow range $0.35 < \Omega_0 < 0.55$. We have also
investigated $n \neq 1$; the extra freedom naturally widens the allowed
parameter region. Assuming a range $0.9<n<1.1$, the allowed range of $\Omega_0$
assuming $h > 0.6$ is at most $0.30 < \Omega_0 < 0.60$.

When there is more than one source of light along the line of sight to a
gravitationally lensed object, the characteristics of the observed light curve
are influenced by the presence of the light that is not lensed. In this paper
we develop a formalism to quantify the associated effects. We find it useful to
introduce the concept of a ``blended Einstein radius" and an ``effective
Einstein radius", to describe the probability that a mass will serve as a lens,
or that a source will be lensed in an observable way. These considerations lead
to generic predictions about the results of gravitational microlensing
experiments. One example is that the optical depth for the lensing of giants is
greater than that for the lensing of main sequence stars; for any given
population of sources and lenses this effect can be quantified. We test and
sharpen these predictions by performing a series of Monte Carlo simulations. We
also outline general methods to (1) test whether specific events which fail to
be fit by point-mass light curves are viable candidates for blended events, (2)
use the effects of blending to learn more about the lensing event than would be
possible if there were no blending, and (3) include the effects of blending
when inferring properties of underlying populations through the statistical
study of lensing events.

We have carried out an investigation of the galaxy environments of low
redshift ($z<0.3$) QSOs by cross-correlating the positions on the sky of
X-ray-selected QSOs/AGN identified in the {\it Einstein} Medium Sensitivity
Survey (EMSS) with those of $B_J<20.5$ galaxies in the APM galaxy catalogues.
At $<5\,$arcmin, we find a significant ($5\sigma$) galaxy excess around $z<0.3$
QSOs. The amplitude of the low redshift ($z<0.3$) QSO-galaxy angular
cross-correlation function is identical to that of the APM galaxy angular
correlation function, implying that these (predominantly radio-quiet) QSOs
inhabit environments similar to those of normal galaxies. No significant galaxy
excess was found around a `control' sample of $z>0.3$ QSOs. Coupled with
previous observations, these results imply that the environment of radio-quiet
QSOs undergoes little evolution over a wide range in redshift ($0 less than z
less than 1.5$). This is in marked contrast to the rapid increase in the
richness of the environments associated with radio-loud QSOs over the same
redshift range. The similarity between QSO-galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
clustering also suggests that QSOs are unbiased with respect to galaxies and
make useful tracers of large-scale structure in the Universe.

Deuterium is the best indicator of the baryon density; however, only its
present abundance is known (and only locally) and its chemical evolution is
intertwined with that of $^3$He. Because galactic abundances are spatially
heterogeneous, mean chemical-evolution models are not well suited for
extrapolating the pre-solar D and $^3$He abundances to their primeval values.
We introduce a new approach which explicitly addresses heterogeneity, and show
that the decade-old big-bang nucleosynthesis concordance interval $\eta \approx
(2 -8)\times 10^{-10}$ based on D and $^3$He is robust.

We present faint galaxy counts from deep $VRI$ images obtained with the Keck
Telescope. These images reach $R\sim27$ in median seeing FWHM $\sim 0.5$--0.6
arcsec and we detect a integrated galaxy number density of $7\times 10^{5}$
degree$^{-2}$, equivalent to $3\times 10^{10}$ galaxies in the observable
Universe. In addition we present median galaxy colors as a function of
magnitude; bluing trends are visible in all colors to $R\sim 24.5$. Fainter
than $R\sim24.5$, however, the typical \VR\ color becomes redder again, \VI\
remains constant, and \RI\ becomes yet bluer. These trends are consistent with
the $VRI$ count slopes, implying a decrease in the $V$ slope at the faintest
levels, which our data supports. Taking advantage of our good seeing we also
present median half-light radii for faint galaxies, these show a steady decline
at fainter magnitudes, leading to an intrinsic half-light radius of $\sim 0.2$
arcsec for a typical $R\sim25.5$--26 galaxy. Irrespective of the redshift
distribution, the extremely high galaxy surface densities and their small
intrinsic sizes are consistent with a scenario in which the majority of the
very faint field population are dwarf galaxies or sub-galactic units.

A simple, physically consistent model has been proposed that seeks to explain
in a unified way the X-ray spectra and rapid X-ray variability of the so-called
Z sources and other accreting neutron stars in low-mass systems. Here we
summarize the results of detailed numerical calculations of the X-ray spectra
of the Z sources predicted by this model. Our computations show that in the Z
sources, photons are produced primarily by electron cyclotron emission in the
neutron star magnetosphere. Comptonization of these photons by the hot central
corona and radial inflow produces X-ray spectra, color-color tracks, and
countrate variations like those observed in the Z sources.

The Yale stellar evolution code has been modified to use the OPAL equation of
state tables (Rogers 1994). Stellar models and isochrones were constructed for
low metallicity systems ($-2.8 \le [Fe/H] \le -0.6$). Above $M\sim 0.7\,\msun$,
the isochrones are very similar to those which are constructed using an
equation of state which includes the analytical Debye-Huckel correction at high
temperatures. The absolute magnitude of the main sequence turn-off (\mvto) with
the OPAL or Debye-Huckel isochrones is about 0.06 magnitudes fainter, at a
given age, than \mvto derived from isochrones which do not include the
Debye-Huckel correction. As a consequence, globular clusters ages derived using
\mvto are reduced by 6 -- 7\% as compared to the ages determined from the
standard isochrones. Below $M\sim 0.7\,\msun$, the OPAL isochrones are
systematically hotter (by approximately 0.04 in B-V) at a given magnitude as
compared to the standard, or Debye-Huckel isochrones. However, the lower mass
models fall out of the OPAL table range, and this could be the cause of the
differences in the location of the lower main-sequences.

We present new high-resolution observations of the center of the late-type
spiral M100 (NGC 4321) supplemented by 3D numerical modeling of stellar and gas
dynamics, including star formation (SF). NIR imaging has revealed a stellar
bar, previously inferred from optical and 21 cm observations, and an
ovally-shaped ring-like structure in the plane of the disk. The K isophotes
become progressively elongated and skewed to the position angle of the bar
(outside and inside the `ring') forming an inner bar-like region. The galaxy
exhibits a circumnuclear starburst in the inner part of the K `ring'. Two
maxima of the K emission have been observed to lie symmetrically with respect
to the nucleus and equidistant from it slightly leading the stellar bar. We
interpret the twists in the K isophotes as being indicative of the presence of
a double inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and test this hypothesis by modeling
the gas flow in a self-consistent gas + stars disk embedded in a halo, with an
overall NGC4321-like mass distribution. We have reproduced the basic morphology
of the region (the bar, the large scale trailing shocks, two symmetric K peaks
corresponding to gas compression maxima which lie at the caustic formed by the
interaction of a pair of trailing and leading shocks in the vicinity of the
inner ILR, both peaks being sites of SF, and two additional zones of SF
corresponding to the gas compression maxima, referred usually as `twin peaks').

We discuss the development and physics of the cosmic virial theorem and its
traditional application as an indicator of the cosmic mean density. The
standard result that the density must be sub-critical relies on the assumption
that the galaxy three-point correlation function accurately describes the mass
distribution around a typical pair of galaxies. To challenge this assumption,
we develop a simple model of this mass distribution based on the extension of
galactic halos. In such a model, one sees clearly the importance of the local
mass distribution around pairs to the prediction of the galaxy pair-wise
velocity dispersion. The model provides insight into the mechanics of the
theorem and demonstrates that a flat universe is {\it consistent} with the
observations. More generally, we conclude that the relative pair-wise velocity
dispersion probes the mass clustered around galaxies and that the observations,
viewed in this light, indicate a lower bound of $\sim 300\; h^{-1}$kpc on the
radius of galactic halos.

We present the light curve of an unusual variable object, DUO 2, detected
during the search for microlensing events by the DUO project. The star remained
stable for more than 150 days before it brightened by more than two magnitudes
in 6 days in the B and R bands. The light curves are achromatic during the
variability. We consider possible explanations of the photometric behavior,
with particular emphasis on the binary lens interpretation of the event. The
masses of the lenses are quite small, with the companion possibly in the range
of a brown dwarf or even a few times of Jupiter. We report evidence of blending
of the source by a companion through the first detection of shift in the light
centroid among all the microlensing experiments. This shift sets a lower limit
of $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ on the separation between the stars. The best lens
model obtained requires moderate blending, which was what motivated us to check
the centroid shift that was subsequently found. The best lens model predicts a
separation of $1^{\prime\prime}$ between the two blended stars. This prediction
was recently tested using two CCD images taken under good seeing conditions.
Both images show two components. Their separation and position angle are in
good agreement with our model.

We investigate the effect of gravitational lensing, produced by linear
density perturbations, for anisotropies of the Cosmic Background Radiation
(CBR) on scales of arcminutes. In calculations, a flat universe ($\Omega=1$)
and the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum ($n=1$) are assumed. The numerical results
show that on scales of a few arcminutes, gravitational lensing produces only
negligible anisotropies in the temperature of the CBR. Our conclusion disagrees
with that of Cay\'{o}n {\it et al.} who argue that the amplification of $\Delta
T/T$ on scales $\le 3'$ may even be larger than 100\%.

High-resolution CO maps of 9 molecular clouds in IC 10 are combined with the
new measurement of the distance to this nearby metal poor galaxy to measure
accurately the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The result for IC 10 is combined
with published data for four other Local Group galaxies (M31, M33, NGC 6822,
the SMC) to trace the dependence of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor on oxygen
abundance. These data show conclusively that the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor
increases as the metallicity of the host galaxy decreases, with the conversion
factor increasing by a factor of 4.6 for a factor of 10 decrease in
metallicity.

$UBV$ photometry is used to re-identify the OB associations which power the
two most luminous HII regions in M33, NGC 604 and NGC 595. There is a
significant difference (2-3 Myr) in the ages of the most recent star formation
episode in these two regions, while NGC 595 also has undergone a prior episode
of star formation (10-15 Myr ago). These data, combined with the presence of
molecular clouds in the heart of NGC 604, suggest that molecular clouds may
survive at least one intense episode of massive star formation. The star
formation efficiencies (mass of stars per mass of gas) of these two HII regions
are up to a factor of 3 larger than the average efficiency in the inner disk of
M33 or in Galactic molecular clouds, but are still only 2-5\%.

We use star counts from 13 deep HST fields imaged with the {\it Wide Field
Camera - 2} in order to constrain the amount of dark matter in the Galaxy that
can be in the form of low-mass main sequence stars or white-dwarfs. Based on
the number of red stars found in our fields, we exclude the possibility that
more than 25\% of the massive dark halo is made up of M dwarfs or subdwarfs;
fairly massive ($M \sim 0.2 M_\odot$) and yet extremely faint ($M_I$ \gtsima
$14.5$) stellar candidates would have to be invoked in order to make the
observed number of stars compatible with that predicted by a stellar dark halo.
White dwarfs must also be intrinsically very faint ($M_I$ \gtsima $14$) in
order to be consistent with the observed number of faint stars in the HST
fields. We also rule out an increasing or flat stellar luminosity function
beyond $M_V \sim 13$. The inferred slope of the disk luminosity function is
intermediary between local, volume-limited surveys and ground-based photometric
ones. Finally, the magnitude counts are well fitted by existing models for the
structure of the Galaxy, with only small changes in the fiducial values of the
model parameters. The colour distribution, however, is not well reproduced by
the models. It is unclear at present if this reflects inadequacies of the
available models or uncertainties in the colour-magnitude diagrams for low
metallicity stars and in the photometric calibration.

Halpha and UBV photometry of the inner kpc of M33 are used to study the
distribution of OB stars and HII regions in the galaxy and to determine whether
individual regions of the galaxy are in a state of ionization balance. Based on
the surface brightness of the Halpha emission, we identify three distinct
ionized gas environments (bright, halo and field). We find that 50% of the OB
stars are located in the field, so that 1/2 of the lifetime of OB stars must be
spent outside recognizable HII regions. If OB stars escape from bright HII
regions by destroying their parent molecular clouds, this result would imply
that molecular cloud lifetimes after forming OB stars could be as low as 5e6
yrs or 1/2 the typical lifetime of OB stars. Halpha fluxes predicted from
ionization models reveal that none of the regions are in ionization balance:
predicted fluxes are a factor of 3-7 greater than observed. The heaviest loss
of ionizing photons appears to be taking place in the field. Our results
suggest that star formation rates obtained from Halpha luminosities must
underestimate the true star formation rate in these regions of M33.

Halpha and UBV photometry of NGC 6822 are used to study the distribution of
OB stars and HII regions in the galaxy and to determine whether individual
regions of the galaxy are in a state of ionization balance. Four distinct
components of the Halpha emission (bright, halo, diffuse and field)
differentiated by their surface brightnesses are identified. We find that
approximately 1/2 of all OB stars in NGC 6822 are located in the field while
only 1/4 are found in the combined bright and halo regions, suggesting that OB
stars spend roughly 3/4 of their lifetimes outside ``classical'' H II regions.
Comparing the observed Halpha emission with that predicted from stellar
ionizing flux models, we find that although the bright, halo and diffuse
regions are probably in ionization balance, the field region is producing at
least 6 times as much ionizing flux as is observed. The ionization balance
results in NGC 6822 suggest that star formation rates obtained from Halpha
luminosities must underestimate the true star formation rate in this galaxy by
about 50%. Comparing our results for NGC 6822 with previous results for the
spiral galaxy M33, we find that the inner kiloparsec of M33 is in a more
serious state of ionization imbalance, perhaps due to its higher surface
density of blue stars.

To investigate the distribution of dust in Sb and Sc galaxies we have
analyzed near-infrared and optical surface photometry for an unbiased sample of
37 galaxies. Since light in the $K$-band is very little affected by extinction
by dust, the $B-K$ colour is a good indicator of the amount of extinction, and
using the colour-inclination relation we can statistically determine the
extinction for an average Sb/Sc galaxy. We find in general a considerable
amount of extinction in spiral galaxies in the central regions, all the way out
to their effective radii. In the outer parts, at D$_{K,21}$, or at 3 times the
typical exponential scale lengths of the stellar distribution , we find a
maximum optical depth of 0.5 in $B$ for a face-on galaxy. If we impose the
condition that the dust is distributed in the same way as the stars, this upper
limit would go down to 0.1.

Ring galaxies are commonly known as objects where a burst of star formation
was triggered by a close encounter with an intruder, maybe a satellite galaxy.
BVRI CCD observations of five ring galaxies have been performed. Here we
present the results of a self-consistent approach to reproduce their observed
morphology and spectral energy distribution using updated $N$--body simulations
and evolutionary population synthesis models extending from UV to far--IR
wavelengths. Some suggestions about the evolutionary properties of these
starburst galaxies are then derived.

We study the dipole for a redshift sample of Abell/ACO clusters. To elucidate
the constraints it places on dark matter models, we use numerical simulations
based on the Zel'dovich approximation. We run 20 realizations of each of six
different dark matter models: four of these have a density parameter
$\Omega_0=1$, while the other two have $\Omega_0=0.2$, one with and one without
a cosmological constant term. For the Abell/ACO sample, we evaluate the
parameter $\beta=\Omega_0^{0.6}/b_{ cl}$, which reaches its asymptotic value at
$R=160 Mpc/h$. We find $\beta=0.15\pm 0.04$ and $0.25\pm 0.06$ in LG and CMB
frames respectively. After identifying in the simulations LG-like observers, we
construct mock cluster samples. We find that an alignment between the cluster
dipole and observer velocity, such as that observed (about 20 degrees) should
not be expected necessarily in the simulations. This, together with the large
observer-to-observer variance estimates of $\beta$, makes it difficult to place
any firm constraints on cosmological models. Our results demonstrate that the
large amplitude and convergence depth of the cluster dipole cannot be taken as
strong evidence either for or against a low--density Universe.

We present spectropolarimetric observations of the eclipsing nova-like
variable V1315 Aql, obtained with the aim of determining whether the
single-peaked uneclipsed lines observed in this and related nova-likes are the
result of disc emission scattered into the line of sight by the wind. The data
show linear polarization with a mean value of 0.11+-0.02%. There are no
significant differences between the continuum and line polarizations and no
significant variations with wavelength or binary phase. We argue that the
measured polarization may be attributed to scattering in the interstellar
medium and hence conclude that there is no evidence of polarization intrinsic
to V1315 Aql. We discuss alternative models which promise to resolve the
controversy surrounding these objects.

The contribution of the pair annihilation process in relativistic
electron-positron jets to the gamma-ray emission of blazars is calculated.
Under the same assumptions as for the calculation of the yield of inverse
Compton scattered accretion disk radiation (Dermer and Schlickeiser 1993) we
calculate the emerging pair annihilation radiation taking into account all
spectral broadening effects due to the energy spectra of the annihilating
particles and the bulk motion of the jet. It is shown that the time-integrated
pair annihilation spectrum appears almost like the well-known gamma-ray
spectrum from decaying $\pi^o$-mesons at rest, yielding a broad bumpy feature
located between 50 and 100 MeV. We also demonstrate that for pair densities $>
10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ in the jet the annihilation radiation will dominate the inverse
Compton radiation, and indeed may explain reported spectral bumps at MeV
energies. The refined treatment of the inverse Compton radiation leads to
spectral breaks of the inverse Compton emission in the MeV energy range with a
change in spectral index $\Delta \alpha $ larger than 0.5 as detected in PKS
0528+134 and 3C273.

We present the first detection of parallax effects in a gravitational
microlensing event. Parallax in a gravitational microlensing event observed
only from the Earth appears as a distortion of the lightcurve due to the motion
of the Earth around the Sun. This distortion can be detected if the event
duration is not much less than a year and if the projected velocity of the lens
is not much larger than the orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun. The
event presented here has a duration of 220 days and clearly shows the
distortion due to the Earth's motion. We find that the projected velocity of
the lens is 75+/-5 km/s at an angle of 28+/-4 deg from the direction of
increasing galactic longitude, as expected for a lens in the galactic disk.
  A likelihood analysis yields estimates of the distance to and mass of the
lens: D_{lens} = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.7) kpc and M = 1.3 (+1.3/-0.6) Msun, suggesting
that the lens is a remnant such as a white dwarf or neutron star. A less likely
possibility is that the lens is a main sequence star. If so, we can add our
upper limit on the observed flux from the lens to the analysis. This modifies
the estimates to: D_{lens} = 2.8 (+1.1/-0.6) kpc, and M = 0.6 (+0.4/-0.2) Msun.

We present 5 GHz global VLBI observations of the two Fanaroff Riley Type I
radio galaxies B2 0836+29 and 3C465 (2335+26). For 3C465 we present also 1.7
GHz and 8.4 GHz global VLBI data. In addition VLA observations were used to
obtain arsecond resolution continuum and polarization maps at 5 GHz. Both
sources are very asymmetric on the parsec-scale, with a core and a one-sided
jet, aligned with the main arcsecond scale jet. We place a limit on the
milliarcsecond jet to counterjet brightness ratio B$_{jet}$/B$_{cjet}$ \gtsim
20 and \gtsim 30 for B2 0836+29 and 3C465 respectively. For 3C465 the strong
asymmetry holds to the kiloparsec scale. The brightness asymmetry and the ratio
between the core radio power and total radio power allow us to constrain the
jet velocity close to the core and the orientation of the radio structure with
respect to the line of sight. The results suggest that the plasma speed is
relativistic on the parsec scale for both sources, i.e. v$_{jet}$ \gtsim 0.75c
for B2 0836+29 and v$_{jet}$ \gtsim 0.6c for 3C465. While v$_{jet}$ decreases
from the parsec to the kiloparsec scale in B2 0836+29, in 3C465 the very high
v$_{jet}$ holds all the way to the kiloparsec-scale {\t bright spot}. Our
results are in agreement with the unification scheme suggestion that FR-I radio
galaxies are the unbeamed poulation of BL-Lac objects. Furthermore, they
reinforce the idea that the central engine in FR-I and FR-II radio galaxies
must be qualitatively similar. The different radio morphology could then be due
either to an intrinsically different nuclear power, which affects the torus
geometry or to different conditions in the region beyond the parsec scale,
where a significant deceleration in the FR-I jets occurs.

We present $V$ and $I$ photometry for $\sim 150$ globular clusters with $20 <
V < 27$ $\sim 2.5$ arcmin from the centre of M87, the cD galaxy in the Virgo
cluster. The data were acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope which, with
effective resolution 0.1 arcsec, allows us for the first time to distinguish
between globular clusters and most background galaxies on the basis of
morphology, and to obtain accurate photometry even at faint magnitudes. The
$(V-I)$ distribution of the clusters is clearly bimodal, implying a
corresponding bimodality in the metallicity distribution, with peaks at
[Fe/H]$\approx -1.5$ and $-0.5$. We also find that the brightest clusters are
predominantly metal poor, while the fainter clusters are divided roughly
eaually between metal poor and metal rich. Our sample is essentially complete
to $ V\approx 25$, a full magnitude past the expected peak of a ``universal"
luminosity function, and the observed luminosity function is well represented
by the standard gaussian distribution with $<M_V>=-7.2$ and $\sigma = 1.4$.

We report the detection of an optical jet in the nearby Seyfert 1 radio
galaxy 3C 120. The optical jet coincides with the well-known radio jet and
emits continuum radiation (B,V',I) with a radio-to-optical spectral index of
0.65. There are no clear optical counterparts to the radio knots, although the
optical condensation A of the galaxy, which includes the bright 4" radio knot,
is found to be 12 % polarized with the electric field vectors perpendicular to
the jet. These findings indicate that 3C 120 contains the 6th known
extragalactic optical synchrotron jet, quite similar in its properties to the
jet of PKS 0521-36. The outer parts of the jet is the faintest known optical
jet and was discovered as the result of a dedicated effort to detect it. It is
therefore possible that more optical jets can be discovered in systematic
searches by combining deep imaging in the optical or near-IR with careful
galaxy subtraction methods.

Recent experimental data from the Fly's Eye and the Akeno array seem to
indicate significant structure in the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum
above $10^{18}\eV$. A statistically significant dip has been established at
about $5\times10^{18}\eV$. In addition, each experiment observed a different
superhigh energy event above $10^{20}\eV$ separated from the rest of the data
by about half a decade in energy. In this article we discuss what this implies
for the existence or non-existence of the ``Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff'',
a long lasting and still open question in cosmic ray physics. This cutoff,
caused by energy losses in the cosmic microwave background, is predicted to
occur at a few times $10^{19}\eV$ if cosmic rays are produced by shock
acceleration of lower energy particles at extragalactic distances. We show that
from the spectral point of view, sources nearer than a few $\Mpc$ are still
consistent with the data at the $1\sigma$ level, provided these sources
accelerate particles beyond $3\times10^{20}\eV$. However, persistence of the
apparent gap in the existing data at the level of a 4 times higher total
exposure would rule out a wide range of acceleration models at $98\%$ C.L.,
whether they rely on nearby or extragalactic sources. This might hint to the
existence of a ``top down'' mechanism which produces an additional hard
component of ultrahigh energy particles directly, say, by decay from some
higher energy scale in contrast to bottom up acceleration of charged particles.
In this scenario a cutoff followed by a pronounced spectral flattening and
possibly even a gap could naturally be formed.

We describe the results of a hybrid matrix--Monte Carlo calculation of
cascading of UHE cosmic rays and $\gamma$-rays through the cosmic background
radiation fields over cosmological distances. We calculate the $\gamma$-ray and
neutrino emission that results from the cascade, as well as the effect of
cascading on the primary spectrum. We discuss the results for various cosmic
ray injection spectra and primary species. Certain models for the production of
the highest energy cosmic rays are ruled out.

Recent observations of Cepheids in the Virgo cluster have bolstered the
evidence that supports a Hubble constant in 70-90 km/s/Mpc range. This
evidence, by and large, probes the expansion of the Universe within 100 Mpc. We
investigate the possibility that the expansion rate within this region is
systematically higher than the true expansion rate due to the presence of a
local, large underdense region or void. We begin by calculating the expected
deviations between the locally measured Hubble constant and the true Hubble
constant for a variety of models. We also discuss the expected correlations
between these deviations and mass fluctuation for the sample volume. We find
that the fluctuations are small for the standard cold dark matter as well as
mixed dark matter models but can be substantial in a number of interesting and
viable nonstandard scenarios. However, deviations in the Hubble flow for a
region of radius 200 Mpc are small for virtually all reasonable models.
Therefore, methods based on supernovae or the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which
can probe 200 Mpc scales, will be essential in determining the true Hubble
constant. We discuss, in detail, the fluctuations induced in the cosmic
background radiation by voids at the last scattering surface. In addition, we
discuss the dipole and quadrupole fluctuations one would expect if the void
enclosing us is aspherical or if we lie off-center.

We present a software package for combining three monochromatic images of an
astronomical object into a trichromatic color image. We first discuss the
meaning of "true" colors in astronomical images. We then describe the different
steps of our method, choosing the relevant dynamic intensity range in each
filter, inventorying the different colors, optimizing the color map, modifying
the balance of colors, and enhancing contrasts at low intensity levels. While
the first steps are automatic, the last two are interactive.

This is a presentation of the purpose of astronomy in the context of modern
society. After exposing two misconceptions about astronomy, I detail its role
in five domains, certified knowledge, incorporated abilities, innovations,
collective goods, and popular science; with each domain is associated an
institution, an incentive, and a method of evaluation. Finally, I point out the
role of astronomy as a source of inspiration in other fields than science.

We have visually examined twelve Palomar red Plates for galaxies at low
Galactic latitude b, where the Supergalactic Plane (SGP) is crossed by the
Galactic Plane (GP), at Galactic longitude l ~135 degrees. The catalogue
consists of 2575 galaxy candidates, of which 462 have major axis diameters d >=
0.8 arc min (uncorrected for extinction). Galaxy candidates can be identified
down to |b| ~ 0 degrees. One of our galaxy candidates (J24 = Dwingeloo 1) has
recently been discovered independently in 21cm by Kraan-Korteweg et al. (1994)
as a nearby galaxy. Comparisons with the structures seen in the IRAS and UGC
catalogues are made. We compare the success rate of identifying galaxies using
the IRAS Point Source Catalogue under different colour selection criteria. The
criteria that require both the 60 micron and 100 micron fluxes to be of high
quality, have the highest probability of selecting a galaxy (with d >= 0.6 arc
min), but at the expense of selecting a smaller number of galaxies in total.

We present evidence that clumps of \lya lines are physically associated with
about half of the extensive metal-line systems (absorption systems with four or
more observed metal-line species) found in this paper, demonstrate that all
four \lylimit systems discussed here correspond to extensive metal-line
absorption systems, and present an extraordinary pair of extensive metal-line
absorption systems within 2000~km/s of each other at $z~=~0.95$ that are
probably an early manifestation of large scale structure. These results are
obtained using ultraviolet spectra, taken with the higher-resolution gratings
of the Faint Object Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, for four
quasars with emission-line redshifts between 1.0 and 1.3. We also determine the
evolution of \lya absorption lines at redshifts less than 1.3 by combining the
results for 13 smaller redshift quasars discussed in Paper I of this series
with the 4 moderate redshift quasars analyzed in the present paper. For $z_{\rm
abs}~\leq~1.3$, the density of \lya lines with equivalent widths greater than
0.24~\AA\ is adequately fit by $\left(dN/dz\right) =\left(dN/dz\right)_0
\cdot(1 + z)^\gamma$ with $(dN/dz)_0 = 24.3 \pm 6.6$ \lya lines per unit
redshift, and $\gamma = 0.58 \pm 0.50$ (1-$\sigma$ uncertainties). This rate of
evolution at low redshifts is less than the evolutionary rate inferred from
several different ground-based data samples that pertain to high redshifts. The
observed gaseous structures at redshifts of $0.5$ to $1.0$ with velocity
dispersions of $6 \times 10^2$ \kms to $1.4 \times 10^3$ \kms (or velocity
spans of $1.2 \times 10^3$ \kms to $3 \times 10^3$ \kms) constitute a
constraint on cosmological models of structure formation.

We present an argument for a {\it lower limit} to the Compton-$y$ parameter
describing spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The
absence of a detectable Gunn-Peterson signal in the spectra of high redshift
quasars demands a high ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM).
Given an ionizing flux at the lower end of the range indicated by the proximity
effect, an IGM representing a significant fraction of the
nucleosynthesis-predicted baryon density must be heated by sources other than
the photon flux to a temperature $\go {\rm few} \times 10^5\, K$. Such a gas at
the redshift of the highest observed quasars, $z\sim 5$, will produce a $y\go
10^{-6}$. This lower limit on $y$ rises if the Universe is open, if there is a
cosmological constant, or if one adopts an IGM with a density larger than the
prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

ASCA observations of 4 high redshift radio--loud quasars with 1.44$<$z$<$3.21
are presented. The spectral analysis for three of them (PKS 0332-403, PKS
0537-286, PKS 2149-306) reveals that their X-ray continuum emission is well
represented by a simple power--law model plus absorption with photon indices of
$\Gamma =1.92^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$ (PKS 0332-403), $\Gamma =1.63^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$
(PKS 0537-286) and $\Gamma =1.57\pm 0.05$ (PKS 2149-306). The fourth and most
distant object, PKS 1614+051 at z=3.21, was detected, but a detailed spectral
analysis is impossible due to the small number of photons. We find evidence for
excess absorption above the Galactic $N_H$--value in the ASCA data of PKS
2149-306, which is not confirmed by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey PSPC spectrum of
this source. This could probably be due to variable absorption. The ROSAT
spectrum of PKS 0537-286, deduced from a 10 ksec pointed PSPC observation, is
consistent with the ASCA results. Thermal bremsstrahlung models also give
acceptable fits to the ASCA data with best fit (rest frame) temperatures of
10.4, 33.5 and 45.8 keV for PKS 0332-403, PKS 0537-286 and PKS 2149-306,
respectively. More complicated models for the X-ray continuum are not required,
in particular, tight upper limits on the strength of the Fe-K emission line are
given. The broad band spectral energy distributions from the radio to the
$\gamma$-rays are presented and discussed.

ROSAT observations of a homogeneous sample of radio--selected BL Lac objects
are presented. Results of a detailed spectral analysis in the soft 0.1-2.0 keV
energy range are discussed and compared with similar previously published
results. The X--ray spectral shape is discussed in relation to the overall
energy distribution with particular emphasys on the high energy gamma--ray
emission recently detected by CGRO--EGRET for about half of the objects in the
sample. Dividing the objects in our sample on the basis of the radio to X--ray
flux ratio (alpha_rx) we show that objects with alpha_rx > 0.75 have flatter
X--ray spectra and are likely to be stronger gamma--ray emitters than objects
with alpha_rx < 0.75. Moreover we note that the value of the peak energy of the
synchrotron component, in a E * F(E) plot, correlates with alpha_rx and
alpha_x.

In the now well established conventional view (see Rees [1] and references
therein), quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and related active galactic nuclei (AGN)
phenomena are explained as the result of accretion of plasma onto giant black
holes which are postulated to form via gravitational collapse of the high
density regions in the centers of massive host galaxies. This model is
supported by a wide variety of indirect evidence and seems quite likely to
apply at least to some observed AGN phenomena. However, one surprising set of
new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations [2-4] directly challenges the
conventional model, and the well known evolution of the QSO population raises
some additional, though not widely recognized, difficulties. We propose here an
alternative possibility: the Universe contains a substantial independent
population of super-massive black holes, and QSO's are a phenomenon that occurs
due to their collisions with galaxies or gas clouds in the intergalactic medium
(IGM). This hypothesis would naturally explain why the QSO population declines
very rapidly towards low redshift, as well as the new HST data.

The recent association of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) with counterparts in
other wavebands has sparked much interest in these sources. One of the recent
models for these objects is that they originate in the environs of neutron
stars with fields much stronger than the quantum critical field
\teq{B_{cr}=4.413\times 10^{13}} Gauss. Near such neutron stars, dubbed
magnetars, the exotic quantum process of magnetic photon splitting becomes
prolific. Its principal effect is to degrade photon energies and thereby soften
gamma-ray spectra from neutron stars; it has recently been suggested that
splitting may be responsible for limiting the hardness of emission in SGRs, if
these sources originate in neutron stars with supercritical surface fields.
Seed photons in supercritical fields efficiently generate soft gamma-ray
spectra, typical of repeaters. In this paper, the influence of the curved
dipole field geometry of a neutron star magnetosphere on the photon splitting
rate is investigated. The dependence of the attenuation length on the location
and angular direction of the seed photons is explored.

We have performed numerical simulations of the interplanetary transport of
solar cosmic rays. The particles form a coherent pulse within $\sim0.01$ AU
after their injection. The gradual decrease of a pulse's speed and anisotropy
can be understood in terms of an equilibrium between pitch-angle scattering and
focusing. The results should be useful for estimating times of particle
injection.

In this paper, we use large $\pppm$ N-body simulations to study the
three-point correlation function $\zeta$ of clusters in two theoretical models.
The first model (LCDM) is a low-density flat model of $\Omega_0=0.3$,
$\Lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$, and the second model (PIM) is an
Einstein-de-Sitter model with its linear power spectrum obtained from
observations. We found that the scaled function $Q(r,u,v)$, which is defined as
the ratio of $\zeta (r, ru, ru+rv)$ to the hierarchical sum $\xi (r)\xi (ru)+
\xi (ru) \xi (ru+rv) +\xi (ru+rv)\xi (r)$ (where $\xi$ is the two-point
correlation function of clusters), depends weakly on $r$ and $u$, but very
strongly on $v$. $Q(r,u,v)$ is about 0.2 at $v=0.1$ and 1.8 at $v=0.9$. A model
of $Q(r,u,v)=\Theta 10^{1.3v^2}$ can fit the data of $\zeta$ very nicely with
$\Theta\approx 0.14$. This model is found to be universal for the LCDM clusters
and for the PIM clusters. Furthermore, $Q(r,u,v)$ is found to be insensitive to
the cluster richness. We have compared our N-body results with simple
analytical theories of cluster formation, like the peak theories or the local
maxima theories. We found that these theories do not provide an adequate
description for the three-point function of clusters. We have also examined the
observational data of $\zeta$ presently available, and have not found any
contradiction between the observations and our model predictions. The
$v$-dependence of $q$ in a projected catalogue of clusters is shown to be much
weaker than the $v$-dependence of $Q$ found in the three-dimensional case. It
would be important to search for the $v$-dependence of $Q$ in redshift samples
of rich clusters.

Compact steady sources of X-ray emission have been detected at the positions
of at least two soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). These sources have been
interpreted as synchrotron nebulae powered by the neutron star that is causing
the bursts. We explore a plerion model for the sources surrounding SGRs where
the steady observed emission is powered by the SGR bursts rather than by the
spin-down of a pulsar. In this case there is no limit on the neutron star
magnetic field. We find that the synchrotron lifetime of the particles injected
into the plerion around SGR1806-20 is long enough to smear out nebular emission
from individual bursts. Transient nebular emission would therefore not be
detected following an SGR burst. The combined radio emission from multiple
burst injections is expected to have a steeper spectrum than that of a typical
plerion.

Using single channel infrared photometry from the literature, a provisional
K-band diameter--velocity dispersion relation for elliptical galaxies in the
Coma and Virgo clusters is derived. The Coma cluster relation has \~1.5 times
lower scatter at K than in B or V. Excluding 4 outliers, the RMS scatter at K
for 24 galaxies in Coma is only 4.8% in distance, close to the limit implied by
the observational errors. Distance estimates based on the IR \Dsig relation
will be more accurate than those derived from optical data. The improvement in
the infrared is attributed to a decrease in sensitivity to stellar population
parameters (age, metallicity, and slope of the IMF) as well as lower internal
extinction from dust compared to the optical. That the \Dsig relation has a
larger scatter in the optical indicates that there are detectable, but small,
stellar population or dust content differences among the Coma ellipticals.
Since the \Dsig relations are based on the fundamental plane, this result
promises that the fundamental plane is thinner in the infrared than it is in
the optical.
  Infrared photometric data available for Virgo are limited to just 13 objects;
the spread in distance due to the depth of the cluster precludes any
significant improvement over B and V. A relative Coma-Virgo distance of 5.56 is
derived from the K band data, in agreement with estimates in other colors and
using other techniques, indicating that there is no significant age difference
between Virgo and Coma ellipticals.

Recent observations of GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655+40 reveal superluminal
motions in Galactic sources. This letter examines the physical conditions
within these Galactic sources, their interaction with their environment, their
possible formation, and contrasts them with their extragalactic counterparts.
In particular, e$^{+}$-e$^{-}$ and e-p jets are contrasted, constraints on
particle acceleration in the jets are imposed using X-ray and radio
observations, the $\gamma$-ray flux from e$^+$-e$^-$ jets expected at EGRET
energies and the flux in infrared lines from an e-p jet are estimated. It is
also suggested that these sources may exhibit low frequency radio lobes
extending up to several hundred parsecs in size, strong, soft X-ray absorption
during the birth of the radio components and emission line strengths
anti-correlated with the X-ray flux. The implications for other X-ray
transients are briefly discussed.

In order to further test our hypothesis that jets and disk around compact
accreting objects are symbiotic features we investigate the newly discovered
superluminal galactic radio jets GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40 and the two
famous galactic radio jets 1E1740-2942 and SS 433 within the framework of our
couple jet/disk model developed initially for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
the galactic center source Sgr A*. By comparing the ``disk'' and radio core
luminosity of those galactic jet sources with our model prediction we can show
that they can easily be understood as AGN-like jets where the accretion power
onto a central compact object is scaled down by several orders of magnitude.
The total power of the jets must be comparable to the disk luminosity - at
least for the superluminal sources. To broaden our view we also shortly discuss
the situation in other galactic flat spectrum radio source associated with
compact objects -- the X-ray binaries Cyg X-1, Cyg X-2, Cyg X-3 and Sco X-1 --
where a jet origin has been proposed earlier on theoretical grounds. In an
disk/radio luminosity their radio cores also fall within our model prediction
for scaled down radio loud and radio weak AGN-jets. Taking all sources together
and comparing their L_disk/radio ratio we find an indication for a similar
radio loud/radio weak dichotomy as found earlier for quasar radio cores,
however, a larger number of galactic jet sources is needed to confirm this
trend.
