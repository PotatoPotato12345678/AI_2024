This perspective abstract highlights the critical demand for culturally sensitive technology in dementia caregiving due to the heightened risk and unique challenges faced by individuals from diverse backgrounds. The escalating prevalence of dementia necessitates a caregiving paradigm shift, especially in the context of diverse cultural backgrounds. Research consistently underscores the existence of cultural disparities in dementia risk, diagnosis, and care outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for culturally sensitive technology in dementia care. Individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds often face unique challenges in accessing and receiving adequate dementia care. These challenges may stem from variations in communication styles, beliefs, and societal attitudes toward dementia. Culturally sensitive technology has the potential to bridge these gaps by tailoring interventions to align with specific cultural contexts. It can enhance communication, understanding, and overall caregiving effectiveness, providing personalized support that respects the cultural nuances of those affected by dementia. Moreover, incorporating cultural sensitivity into technology design not only addresses disparities but also contributes to more inclusive healthcare practices. Culturally tailored technologies can empower caregivers with tools that recognize and respect diverse perspectives, fostering a more collaborative and patient-centered approach. In essence, the need for culturally sensitive technology in dementia care is paramount to ensuring equitable access, improving outcomes, and promoting a holistic understanding of the multifaceted challenges faced by individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds affected by dementia. This imperative aligns with the broader goal of enhancing the quality of life for all individuals affected by dementia while fostering a more inclusive and compassionate healthcare environment.

Sexual health, pleasure, justice (equity in sexual rights and experiences), and well-being are crucial determinants of health and life quality, yet often overlooked in the rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) field. However, this topic has received more attention recently, and there is a need to map the current literature to inform the direction of future studies. Hence, this protocol outlines a scoping review to systematically map existing evidence on sexual health in people with RMD, exploring key themes and identifying evidence gaps across multiple dimensions, including sexual well-being, justice and pleasure. This scoping review will follow the methodological guidance of the Joanna Briggs Institute and be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews. The search strategy will involve PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, PsychInfo, LGBTQIA+ Source, Web of Science, and the grey literature. Identified articles will be reviewed based on the eligibility criteria. The results will be narratively synthesised and aligned with the framework proposed by Mitchel et al. (2021), identifying four pillars of comprehensive public health for sexuality: 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Pleasure', 'Sexual Justice', and 'Sexual Well-Being'. The scoping review will synthesise the scientific literature published on sexual health, pleasure, justice and well-being in people with RMD. This review will provide an understanding of how sexual health is addressed in the literature to inform future research and clinical practices. The findings will be disseminated as research publications, including peer-reviewed article(s), conference abstract(s)/presentation(s), and plain language summaries.

As students spend most of their time in school, a supportive school environment is essential for adolescents' personal growth, effective learning, and well-being. Students actively participate in learning when they feel supported, respected, and connected to their school environment. An unhealthy school climate might significantly influence health-related and educational outcomes during adolescence. Therefore, a positive and supportive school climate can contribute significantly to the emotional health as well as academic achievement of adolescents. The present systematic review explores the relationships among school climate, emotional health outcomes, and academic achievements among school-going adolescents in India. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024567954). A systematic literature search was conducted across multiple databases, such as PsycINFO, EBSCO Host (Psychology and behavioral sciences collection), PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global: The Humanities and Social Sciences Collection, Shodhganga, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar which are recognized sources of high-quality publications. It covered published as well as unpublished research studies, including peer-reviewed journals and gray literature, such as reports of programs on the impact of the school climate on the emotional health and academic achievement of adolescents between January 2000 and December 2023. An initial search returned a total of 383 studies screened by two reviewers. After the title and abstract screening, 30 studies were left out for full-text review, and ultimately, eleven studies have remained for the present systematic review. The findings of the current review indicated that positive school climate characteristics such as student-teacher relationships, peer support, a sense of connectedness, school belongingness, methods of learning, and teaching were significantly associated with reduced symptoms of depression, stress, improved self-esteem, and academic performance among high school students. These results demonstrated the important role of a protective and supportive school climate in promoting overall well-being and educational achievements among Indian adolescents. The review considerably evidenced the significance of school climate in determining school-going adolescents' emotional health and academic achievement. This indicated the requirement to implement school-based intervention packages in secondary schools to improve the school climate. The whole school approach could be a better strategy for intervention. Not applicable.

Endophenotypes aid in studying the complex genetic basis of bipolar disorder. We aimed to compare first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar I disorder in a hospital in India with unrelated healthy controls in terms of neurocognition and affective temperament METHODS. This cross-sectional study was conducted between August and November 2012 at a tertiary hospital in India. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of patients with bipolar I disorder were included; they were aged 18 to 50 years and had education level of at least eighth grade. Additionally, matched healthy controls were recruited from the general population. Sociodemographic data were collected using a semi-structured proforma. Participants were assessed for verbal and visual working memory, executive function (including cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, as well as concept formation, abstract reasoning, and set-shifting abilities), and affective temperament by a single investigator. Of the 52 first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, 30 were included in the analysis. Additionally, 30 matched healthy controls from the general population were included for comparison. Compared with healthy controls, first-degree relatives performed significantly poorer in all tests and had significantly higher scores for cyclothymic, hyperthymic, and anxious temperaments. Impairments in working memory, executive function, and certain affective temperaments are potential endophenotypes for bipolar I disorder. Working memory and executive function are most important cognitive domains for social, occupational, and interpersonal functioning. These potential markers could be used to trace susceptible genes for bipolar disorder and thus enhance our understanding of the complex genetics of mood disorders.

Tackling social impacts derived from gender disparities is a pathway to universal health coverage (UHC). Gender intersects with other factors behind social and health inequalities, exacerbates them and influences health systems' performance. However, there is scarcity of gender-based studies that assess the social and economic impacts of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study aims to identify economic and social impacts of NCDs by gender and its correlates. Following the guidelines proposed in the Cochrane Manual for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the PRISMA Statement, we conducted a narrative and structured literature review to identify the economic (direct medical and non-medical, and indirect costs) and social (right to health, employment, poverty, social exclusion, and others) impacts of NCDs by gender, and its structural, sociodemographic, health conditions, political and health systems correlates, for the period 2002-2022, in English and Spanish. Reviewed studies were described according to country and research context, temporal evolution, gender, impacts of NCDs and correlates. Five thousand five hundred fifty-one publications by title and abstract were reviewed, and 185 articles were selected. There is limited evidence with gender perspective addressing the social and economic impacts of NCDs (around 10% of publications) that helps to better understand the difference in the burden of these conditions between men and women. We identified that the social burden primarily affects women in their quality of life, where gender inequities are observed in aspects such as: health care, employment status and living conditions. In addition, a greater responsibility falls on them as caregivers. On the other hand, the economic burden affects more to men, both in terms of direct medical costs and indirect costs. Among the factors that most influenced the identified impacts, we found gender, age, and socioeconomic level. We also identified that access to health insurance that offers financial protection against these conditions is essential to reduce these impacts. NCDs pose a significant social and economic burden due to their impact on the health of the population, healthcare systems, and the economies of households and nations, which will likely increase over time. This impact is closely related to gender, although it has been scarcely documented. Public policies aimed at enhancing access and achieving UHC are essential to guarantee effective financial protection in health, especially for the most vulnerable sectors of the population.

The World Health Organization has recognized maternal mental illness as an emerging issue. Previous studies have indicated that maternal mental illness is associated with socioeconomic status (SES). However, there is a lack of research concerning the mental health of pregnant people with low SES in Ontario, Canada. In this study, we examined associations between mental health conditions during pregnancy and two SES indicators: the pregnant person's residential neighbourhood income and education level. A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted, consisting of all singleton pregnancies resulting in stillbirths or live births in Ontario hospitals from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2021. Data were linked from the BORN Information System database, Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database, and Canadian Census. Poisson regression with robust error variance models was performed to estimate the relative risks of anxiety, depression, anxiety and/or depression, or any mental health condition during pregnancy, by SES indicator. We adjusted for maternal age, obesity status in pre-pregnancy, certain pre-existing maternal health conditions, substance use during pregnancy, race, and rural or urban residence. Within the cohort (n = 1,202,292), 10.5% (126,076) and 8.1% (97,135) of pregnant individuals experienced anxiety and depression, respectively, and 15.8% (189,616) had at least one mental health condition during pregnancy. The trend test (p < 0.0001) showed a significant downward trend in the total rates of mental health conditions by increasing SES quintiles. Pregnant individuals in the lowest neighbourhood income quintile tended to have a higher risk of anxiety (aRR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.22-1.27), depression (aRR: 1.56, 95%CI: 1.52-1.59), anxiety and/or depression (aRR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.11-1.15), or any mental health condition (aRR: 1.18, 95%CI: 1.16-1.19). Similarly, pregnant people living in the lowest education level neighbourhoods had higher likelihoods of anxiety (aRR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.62-1.69), depression (aRR: 2.09, 95%CI: 2.04-2.14), anxiety and/or depression (aRR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.39-1.44), and any mental health condition (aRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.38-1.43). Despite a universal healthcare system, the variations in mental health prevalence and risk during pregnancy based on SES suggest health inequity in Ontario, Canada. Future studies are needed to examine the mechanisms of this health inequity to guide policy makers in reducing disparities in Ontario.

Despite increases in modern contraception use, socioeconomic inequalities in family planning persist. In this study, we aimed to measure progress in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) and demand for family planning satisfied by modern methods (mDFPS) in 48 countries as part of the Family Planning 2030 (FP2030) initiative between 1990 and 2020 for which Demographic and Health Survey data were available. We analysed two rounds of Demographic and Health Survey data per country. Changes in concentration indices between two survey rounds were compared to measure reductions in overall socioeconomic-related inequalities in modern contraceptive use. Poisson regression models were used to measure the adjusted average annual rate of change across wealth quintiles. In this population-based analysis study, all countries reduced socioeconomic-related inequalities in modern contraceptive use among in-union women of reproductive age (15-49 years) during the observed 30-year period. On average, mCPR increased at an annual rate of 2·1% (95% CI 2·1-2·2), and the rate of increase for the poorest women was 3·1% (3·0-3·2), which outpaced the rate of increase for the richest women of 1·3% (1·3-1·4%). The pattern of progress was similar for mDFPS, but at a slower pace. Overall, levels of mCPR and mDFPS increased, and socioeconomic-related inequalities were reduced during this period. Substantial progress has been made in reducing socioeconomic-related inequalities in family planning across the 48 studied countries, which account for 86% of the population of the 82 FP2030 initiative countries. During the past three decades, poorer women have seen greater improvements in modern contraceptive use and demand satisfaction compared with richer women. As contraceptive prevalence rates are near their maximum, it is crucial to ensure marginalised and vulnerable groups are not left behind. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The uptake of HIV partner status notification remains limited in low- and lower-middle-income countries. This mixed-methods systematic review aims to summarize the barriers and facilitators of HIV partner status notification in these settings. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science from January 01, 2000, to August 31, 2023, for empirical qualitative and quantitative studies. Two independent reviewers completed the title, abstract, full-text screening, and data extraction. The risk of bias was assessed using a mixed-methods appraisal tool (MMAT), and the study findings were summarized narratively. Out of the 2094 studies identified, 59 relevant studies were included. Common barriers included fear of stigma and discrimination, violence, abandonment, breach of confidentiality and trust, low HIV-risk perception, and limited knowledge of HIV and HIV testing. Facilitators of HIV partner status notification were feelings of love and closeness in marital relationships, feelings of protecting self and partners, and HIV counseling services. Efforts to improve HIV partner status notification in low- and lower-middle-income countries should consider barriers and facilitators across all its components, including notification, testing, and linkage to treatment. In addition, HIV partner services must be adapted to the unique needs of key populations.

In low-income and middle-income countries, an estimated 181·9 million (74·6%) preschool-aged children do not receive adequate nurturing care in health, nutrition, protection, learning, and responsive care, thus jeopardising their healthy development across the life course. Working alongside the health sector, multisectoral actions including social protection and education are necessary to achieve child health and development outcomes. Innovations are needed to expand access to high-quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) for young children and opportunities for youth development. Youth Leaders for Early Childhood Assuring Children are Prepared for School (LEAPS) is a two-generation programme that trains female youth aged 18-24 years to deliver ECCE. We evaluated the effectiveness of LEAPS to improve children's school readiness when delivered at scale in rural Pakistan. We implemented a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial with three steps from Dec 3, 2018, to June 30, 2021. 99 villages (clusters) in four districts in rural Sindh, Pakistan, were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to introduce LEAPS across three steps. Eligible clusters were those that had a feeder primary school run by the National Commission for Human Development, a department of the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training; were safe; had space for a LEAPS preschool; could identify a female youth to deliver the ECCE service; and had not previously participated in the pilot study. Government partners trained female youth, aged 18-24 years, to provide community-based ECCE, enrolling up to 20 children, aged 3·5-5·0 years, per class. Population-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted at baseline and after each step for children who were eligible if they resided in the cluster, were aged 4·5-5·5 years at the time of the survey, and without any severe clinical health conditions or disability. The primary outcome was children's school readiness using the International Development and Early Learning Assessment (IDELA) composite score comprising emergent numeracy, emergent literacy, socio-emotional development, and motor skills. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted, using linear mixed models accounting for clustering and the stepped-wedge design. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764436). LEAPS was implemented in 91 of 99 villages. In eight clusters, a LEAPS preschool could not be set up. For the intervention programme, the average enrolment of children in a LEAPS preschool was 19 (SD 3, range 12-20). A total of 3858 children (n=3852 with complete IDELA data) were assessed across the four survey rounds conducted between Jan 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021. LEAPS increased school readiness (standardised mean difference: 0·30 [95% CI 0·20-0·40]; p<0·0001) as compared with the control condition. LEAPS offers a scalable solution to expand access to high-quality ECCE and promote children's school readiness while providing employment for female youth in rural Pakistan and settings with similarly low ECCE participation.

Informal caregivers are essential in supporting end-of-life patients at home but are often ill-prepared for the carer role. There is growing interest in the development of tools to assess caregiver support needs and a recognised need for a greater focus on addressing inequities in end-of-life care. We plan to undertake a scoping review of available literature to (1) identify and describe tools developed to assess the support needs of informal caregivers in end-of-life care; (2) report on any inequities and under-represented groups in tool development and use. The review will conform to best practice methodological guidance (Joanna Briggs Institute) for scoping reviews. The search strategy will target published and unpublished studies using any methodology, which reports on developing or using tools or measures to assess informal carer support needs in end-of-life/palliative care settings. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ASSIA and Proquest. Both title/abstract screening and full-text assessment will be undertaken to ensure eligibility. Searches will be conducted between May and December 2024. We will extract data relating to (1) tools/measures identified, and outcome measures used to assess these; (2) participant characteristics. Extracted data will be tabulated with accompanying narrative description to address the review objectives. Data will be extracted and write-up will be completed between January and May 2025. This scoping review will provide an overview of the tools developed to identify and assess informal caregiver support needs in palliative and end-of-life care. The identification of any inequities will increase awareness of potentially underserved groups and contexts within the current literature, highlighting how future research and resource can be more equitably focused and implemented in a way that does not further embed disparity. Findings will be made publicly available through the Open Science Framework and disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication. As a scoping review of available literature, this work does not require ethical approval.

Suicide remains a public health priority worldwide with over 700,000 deaths annually, ranking as a leading cause of death among young adults. Traditional research methodologies have often fallen short in capturing the multifaceted nature of suicide, focusing on isolated risk factors rather than the complex interplay of individual, social, and environmental influences. Recognizing these limitations, there is a growing recognition of the value of dynamic simulation modeling to inform suicide prevention planning. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of existing dynamic models of population-level suicide and suicide-related behaviors, and to summarize their methodologies, applications, and outcomes. Eight databases were searched, including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Compendex, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and medRxiv, from inception to July 2023. We developed a search strategy in consultation with a research librarian. Two reviewers independently conducted the title and abstract and full-text screenings including studies using dynamic modeling methods (eg, System Dynamics and agent-based modeling) for suicide or suicide-related behaviors at the population level, and excluding studies on microbiology, bioinformatics, pharmacology, nondynamic modeling methods, and nonprimary modeling reports (eg, editorials and reviews). Reviewers extracted the data using a standardized form and assessed the quality of reporting using the STRESS (Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies) guidelines. A narrative synthesis was conducted for the included studies. The search identified 1574 studies, with 22 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, including 15 System Dynamics models, 6 agent-based models, and 1 microsimulation model. The studies primarily targeted populations in Australia and the United States, with some focusing on hypothetical scenarios. The models addressed various interventions ranging from specific clinical and health service interventions, such as mental health service capacity increases, to broader social determinants, including employment programs and reduction in access to means of suicide. The studies demonstrated the utility of dynamic models in identifying the synergistic effects of combined interventions and understanding the temporal dynamics of intervention impacts. Dynamic modeling of suicide and suicide-related behaviors, though still an emerging area, is expanding rapidly, adapting to a range of questions, settings, and contexts. While the quality of reporting was overall adequate, some studies lacked detailed reporting on model transparency and reproducibility. This review highlights the potential of dynamic modeling as a tool to support decision-making and to further our understanding of the complex dynamics of suicide and its related behaviors.

End-of-life care supports individuals in the last few weeks or months of their life and their caregivers, offering psychosocial support, symptom management and relief, and resources. While some of the first public end-of-life care facilities were established due to HIV/AIDS, the current needs of caregivers for people living with end-stage HIV are not well understood. Caregivers provide two-thirds of the care for people living with HIV, yet their specific support needs and experiences are under-researched. Existing strategies often use a "one-size-fits-all" approach, which may not address the unique challenges faced by these caregivers, such as stigma and lack of social support. This study aims to synthesize the literature on the end-of-life care experiences and needs of caregivers for individuals living with HIV. A scoping review, guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework and the Joanna Briggs Institute's recommendations, will be conducted. An Information Specialist will assist in developing a search strategy to be applied across databases like Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Search results from each database will be imported into Covidence software for duplicate removal and title and abstract screening. Two researchers will independently screen studies using the 'Population-Concept-Context' (PCC) framework, with screening conducted at two levels: title and abstract, and full-text. The inclusion criteria will be piloted on a random sample of articles to ensure inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic >0.61). Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or with the involvement of a content expert if needed. Final selections will be reported using the PRISMA flow diagram, and reasons for exclusion will be documented. The findings from this scoping review will provide valuable insights into the end-of-life care experiences and support needs of caregivers for individuals living with HIV. By identifying common themes and challenges, such as caregiver fatigue, emotional strain, stigma, and lack of social support, this study will underscore the inadequacy of the current "one-size-fits-all" approach in addressing the unique needs of these caregivers. This research has the potential to influence both clinical practice and policy by advocating for more personalized support strategies within end-of-life care settings.

Survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) often face increased incidents of violence during stressful life events (SLEs) such as economic recessions, environmental disasters, and pandemics. These events can diminish the effectiveness of both formal (e.g., health, social, justice, labor, community) and informal (e.g., friends, family, neighbors) support systems. Additionally, SLEs exacerbate existing health and social inequities, making it necessary to understand the accessibility of support services during these times. This scoping review investigates access to services by individuals experiencing IPV during SLEs in high-income countries. A comprehensive search was conducted across several electronic databases including MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsychInfo (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (EBSCO), Gender Watch (ProQuest), Web of Science, and Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ProQuest), along with the search engine Google Scholar. This search, which imposed no date restrictions, was extended through May 22nd, 2024. Key search terms were developed from prior literature and in consultation with an expert librarian, focusing on 'stressful life events,' 'intimate partner violence,' and 'access to services.'. Each study was screened and extracted by two reviewers and conflicts were resolved through discussion or a third reviewer. The search across eight databases and citation searching resulted in a total of 7396 potentially relevant articles. After removing 1968 duplicates and screening 5428 based on titles and abstracts, 200 articles underwent full abstract review. Ultimately, 74 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were selected for further analysis. The analysis focused on barriers and facilitators to access, identifying challenges within Survivors' support systems, redirected resources during crises, and complex control dynamics and marginalization. Over 90% of the literature included covered the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these challenges requires innovative strategies, sustained funding, and targeted interventions for high-risk subgroups. This scoping review systematically outlined the challenges and enabling factors influencing the availability of support services for Survivors of IPV during SLEs. It underscores the need for robust, culturally sensitive health and social support mechanisms, and policies. Such measures are essential to better protect and assist IPV Survivors and their service providers during these critical times. Furthermore, it is imperative to integrate the insights and expertise of the violence against women (VAW) sector into emergency planning and policy-making to ensure comprehensive and effective responses that address the unique needs of Survivors in crises.

Socio-economic status is associated with self-harm at the individual and area level. In Canada, there is limited evidence on the relationship between area-level markers of socio-economic status and self-harm. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of small area-level material and social deprivation on rates of hospitalization due to self-harm. Administrative data on hospitalizations from two databases in Canada (Discharge Abstract Database and Ontario Mental Health Reporting System) for the period April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2022, were analyzed. Rates of self-harm hospitalization and percentage of repeated admissions were estimated across quintiles of material and social deprivation. Rate ratios were computed to evaluate disparities. The rates were stratified by sex and age group; the percentage of repeated admissions were stratified by sex. In total, the study included 109,398 hospitalizations due to self-harm. Populations in more deprived areas had higher rates of self-harm hospitalizations than those in less deprived areas. The rate ratios for people who lived in the most deprived areas over the least deprived areas were 1.48 (95% CI: 1.38-1.58) and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.60-1.82) for material and social deprivation, separately. The largest disparity was among people aged 25-44 years for material and 45-64 years for social deprivation. Percentages of repeated self-harm hospitalizations were significantly higher in more deprived areas compared to less deprived areas for social deprivation, and among males but not females for material deprivation. Both material and social deprivation were associated with self-harm hospitalization and repeated admissions; the disparity varied by subgroup and the deprivation components. This study demonstrated a need to consider interventions at the neighbourhood level and address both community and population-level conditions of social and material need.

To understand the characteristics of food environments in the Pacific region, and the broader economic, policy and sociocultural surroundings that influence food choices and interventions to improve food environments for Pacific communities. Systematic searches were conducted for articles related to food environments or factors influencing food choices from 1993 to 2024 in five academic databases, Google, Google Scholar and relevant organisations' websites. Studies were included if they meet the eligibility criteria. Two authors independently reviewed the title and abstract of identified articles. Full-text screening was conducted before data were extracted from eligible studies. A narrative analysis was informed by an existing food environments framework. Pacific Island countries or territories that are a member of the Pacific Community (SPC). Not applicable. From the sixty-six included studies (of 2520 records screened), it was clear that food environments in the Pacific region are characterised by high availability and promotion of ultra-processed unhealthy foods. These foods were reported to be cheaper than healthier alternatives and have poor nutritional labelling. Food trade and investment, together with sociocultural and political factors, were found to contribute to unhealthy food choices. Policy interventions have been implemented to address food environments; however, the development and implementation of food environment policies could be strengthened through stronger leadership, effective multisectoral collaboration and clear lines of responsibility. Interventions focused on improving physical, economic, policy and sociocultural influences on food choices should be prioritised in the Pacific region to improve the food environment and mitigate barriers to healthy eating.

Randomised trials for the management of drug-resistant infections are challenging to conduct as target patient populations often lack decision-making capacity, and enrolment windows are typically short. Improving informed consent and risk communication in these trials is especially crucial for protecting patient interests and maximising trial efficiency. This study aimed to understand challenges in risk communication and informed consent in antimicrobial clinical trials. Scoping review. Searches were conducted in Embase, Medline, CINAHL and Web of Science Core for peer-reviewed English articles that were published from January 2000 to April 2023. Included articles were empirical studies or expert opinions that sought experts', patients' or representatives' opinions on informed consent in the context of clinical trials involving antibiotic/anti-infective agents. Abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction and evidence rating were performed by two independent reviewers. Extracted data were summarised and reported qualitatively based on common themes. A total of 2330 records were retrieved, and 29 articles were included in the review. Half of the articles involving medical experts and one-third involving patients and representatives reported that full comprehension by patients and representatives was challenging or not achievable. Healthcare providers and consent takers were crucial for the quality of informed consent. The level of trust consent givers placed on healthcare providers had a critical influence on the consent rate. Emotional distress was pervasive among patients/representatives. The findings indicate that strengthening consent takers' communication skills in providing emotional support to patients and their representatives may improve informed consent. More research is needed to understand informed consent in low-income and middle-income and non-English-speaking countries.

Efforts to improve access to essential medicines globally include the implementation and assessment of national medicine policies. Although existing assessment tools may identify gaps, they do not link these to health system functions and policy priority areas in a way that facilitates decision-making. This systematic review aims to identify and map out existing indicators assessing essential medicines policies; assess their strengths and limitations and understand the parameters required to develop a new instrument for assessing access to medicines in a way that better supports decision makers in identifying and addressing the gaps in their national medicine policies. This systematic review is guided by the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol. Eligible studies will be identified across scholarly databases (MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus) and grey literature using relevant subject headings and text words. Title, abstract screening and full-text screening will be conducted by two independent reviewers. Indicators or assessment tools focused on the performance of national medicine policies with respect to improving access to essential medicines will be eligible. Data will be extracted using a pretested data abstraction form. Findings will be reported in the form of a descriptive narrative. This study will provide insights into the relevance of existing indicators and tools for assessing access to essential medicines policies. This review will also discuss the opportunities for the development of a new instrument for the assessment of national medicines policies in a way that better supports decision makers to improve access to essential medicines. This systematic review does not require ethics approval as it only aims to synthesise evidence from the literature. Findings will be disseminated to key health stakeholders including researchers and global and public health organisations and published in a peer-review journal. This protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023493052).

Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the highest-volume chemicals produced worldwide, and human exposure to BPA is thought to be ubiquitous. Stricter regulations around the use of BPA have led many manufacturers to switch to other bisphenol chemicals with similar functions such as bisphenol S and F. Even though exposure to BPA, other bisphenol chemicals and bisphenol alternatives poses a health risk for humans, very little is known about the granular exposure levels of different populations around the world. This systematic evidence map (SEM) will identify human studies reporting concentrations of bisphenols and their alternatives measured in human bio-samples with the aim to chart the global human exposure levels by country and population characteristics to identify research gaps and discuss any social and environmental injustice implications. MEDLINE®, Embase and Web of Science (WoS) databases as well as grey literature sources will be searched using predefined search strings. The database search results will be supplemented by backward and forward citation tracking on included studies. A scoping exercise conducted during planning identified 90 bisphenol chemicals and alternatives used in plastics. These include BPA, other bisphenol chemicals with/without similar functions to BPA as well as alternatives with similar functions to bisphenol chemicals. Eligible studies must measure concentrations of at least one relevant bisphenol chemical/alternative in human bio-samples. Only primary studies published in English since 2010 will be considered. The title, abstract and keywords will be screened by the DistillerAI tool and two independent reviewers. Grey literature will be screened by two reviewers for inclusion and exclusion. The full text of the included studies will then be screened by two independent reviewers. Study quality will not be evaluated in this SEM. Data extraction and coding will be performed by two independent reviewers. Parameters of interest will include the following: study characteristics (e.g., year of publication, sampling timepoints and study design), population information (e.g., country, age, sex, ethnicity, number of participants) and exposure information (sources of exposure, bio-sample analyzed, chemical name, concentration, and detection frequencies). The results will be presented using a narrative summary, tables, bar plots and color-coded maps. The interactive database will be available on a dedicated freely accessible website. This protocol has been registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and is available at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MNWTD.

Despite the advent of vaccines against COVID-19, there is considerable variation in the acceptance and hesitancy towards the vaccination program across different countries. The objective of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of hesitancy and acceptance regarding the use of the vaccine against the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, and to identify the factors that influence these attitudes. All the cross-sectional studies were retrieved from the PubMed databases, the Web of Science ISI, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Papers published in English between 2 November 2019 and 23 May 2023 were subjected to further assessment based on their title, abstract, and main text, with a view to ensuring their relevance to the present study. Following an exhaustive investigation, 59 studies were selected for screening in this systematic review. The most frequently employed method of data collection was the online survey. The study sample comprised 59.12% women and 40.88% men, with ages ranging from 16 to 78 years. The proportion of individuals accepting the vaccine ranged from 13% to 96%, while the proportion of those exhibiting hesitancy ranged from 0% to 57.5%. The primary reasons for accepting the COIVD-19 vaccine were a heightened perception of risk associated with the virus and a general trust in the healthcare system. The most frequently cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy in the context of the ongoing pandemic include concerns about the potential dangers of the vaccines, the rapid pace of their development, the possibility of adverse effects (such as infertility or death), and the assumption that they have been designed to inject microchips. A variety of socio-demographic factors are implicated in determining the rate of vaccine acceptance. A number of socio-demographic factors have been identified as influencing vaccine acceptance. These include high income, male gender, older age, marriage, the presence of older children who have been vaccinated and do not have chronic diseases, high education, and health insurance coverage. Eliminating vaccine hesitancy or increasing vaccine acceptance is a crucial factor that should be addressed through various means and in collaboration with regulatory and healthcare organizations.

This study analyzes disparities in initial health care responses in Turkey and Syria following the 2023 earthquakes. Using Humanitarian Data Exchange, Crude Mortality Rates (CMR) and injury rates in both countries were calculated, and temporal trends of death tolls and injuries in the first month post- catastrophe were compared. World Health Organization (WHO) Flash Appeal estimated funding requirements, and ratios of humanitarian aid personnel in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams per population from ReliefWeb and MAPACTION data were used to gauge disparities. 56 051 096 individuals were exposed, with Turkey having 44 million vs 12 million in Syria. Turkey had higher CMR in affected areas (10.5 vs. 5.0 per 10,000), while Syria had higher CMR in intensely seismic regions (9.3 vs. 7.7 per 1,000). Turkey had higher injury rates (24.6 vs. 9.9 per 10 000). Death and injury rates plateaued in Syria after 3 days, but steadily rose in Turkey. Syria allocated more funding for all priorities per population except health care facilities' rehabilitation. Turkey had 219 USAR teams compared to Syria's 6, with significantly more humanitarian aid personnel (23 vs. 2/100,000). Significant disparities in the initial health care response were observed between Turkey and Syria, highlighting the need for policymakers to enhance response capabilities in conflict-affected events to reduce the impact on affected populations. The 2023 Turkish-Syrian earthquakes, the most devastating in the region since 1939, heightened challenges in Syria's health care system amid ongoing conflict, disrupting Gaziantep's humanitarian aid supply route. The initial health care responses post-earthquakes in Turkey and Syria were analyzed through a descriptive study, where Crude Mortality Rates (CMR) and injury rates during the first week were calculated. The World Health Organization's funding priorities and the ratio of humanitarian aid personnel in Urban Search and Rescue teams per population were assessed. Turkey had 4-fold higher earthquake exposure and experienced higher CMR and injuries per population, while Syria had higher CMR in intensely seismic regions. Temporal trends showed plateaued death and injury rates in Syria within 3 days, while Turkey's continued to increase. Syria required more funding across nearly all priorities while Turkey had more humanitarian aid personnel per population. Significant health care response disparities were observed, emphasizing the imperative for policymakers to enhance initial responses in conflict-affected events.

In many countries, public transport (PT) services are offered by multiple operators with different modes, such as trains, metros, and buses, which are interchangeable across a single journey. This paper presents a model with one origin (O)-destination(D) path operated by two operators, each of which is responsible for different parts of the OD journey. One operator competes with potential third-party transport companies by offering discount incentives. Such an abstract settings has not been discussed in the literature. We explore how prices, demand, profits, and social welfare change with discounts through a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations under five scenarios. The results indicate that in all the scenarios the operator offering a discount incentive can always attract more passengers and increase its profits. Moreover, reducing the service time of operators offering discounts contributes to an increase in social welfare. Notably, this paper deduces for the first time that the demand scenario aimed at maximizing social welfare is twice as high as that aimed at maximizing total profit. However, in the scenario of maximum social welfare, the profitability of operators becomes challenging.

Rates of alcohol-related mortality (including deaths attributed to chronic alcohol use as well as acute causes involving alcohol) have been increasing in the United States, particularly for certain population subgroups, such as women. This review summarizes associations of area-level social determinants of health with alcohol-related mortality. These determinants, measured at the community, county, or state level, include alcohol control policies, health care availability, and a community's socioeconomic environment. Examining multiple geographic levels illuminates how macro-level social determinants and local contexts contribute to alcohol-related mortality to inform intervention. Attention to the broad variety of social determinants of alcohol-related mortality could ultimately improve community health. A literature search of three databases-PubMed, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)-conducted between March 13 and May 16, 2023, identified peer-reviewed studies published from 1990 to May 2023 that modeled at least one area-level social determinant of health as a predictor or correlate of area-level rates of alcohol-related mortality in the United States. Unpublished dissertations, commentaries, editorials, review papers, and articles published in languages other than English were excluded. Two team members reviewed each abstract to verify that the article addressed alcohol-related mortality and included at least one area-level social determinant of health. The authors screened 313 abstracts and excluded 210 that did not meet inclusion criteria. The full texts of 103 articles were retrieved. Upon further screening, 30 articles were excluded (two were not obtained), leaving 71 studies for detailed review. Many studies analyzed fatal alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes or cirrhosis/liver disease mortality. Fewer analyzed other mortality causes related to chronic alcohol consumption. No studies focused on racism and discrimination, community-level prevention activities, or community social services in relation to alcohol-related mortality. Few studies examined major health policy changes or addressed health care system factors. Although the variation across studies complicates systematic comparison of the results, some key themes did emerge from the reviewed studies, such as the beneficial effects of stronger alcohol policies and the importance of socioeconomic conditions as determinants of alcohol-related mortality. Research using a more diverse set of theoretically informed social determinants may help examine whether, how, and for whom racism and discrimination as well as health policies and social services impact alcohol-related mortality. Finally, there is a gap in research linking local community contexts with alcohol-related mortality. Better understanding of subgroup differences, interactions between different contextual factors, and specific mechanisms of action may help identify promising new strategies to improve population health and reduce alcohol-related mortality.

There are little recent data in China regarding contemporary nutritional inequities among children and adolescents, particularly in relation to urban-rural residence and regional socioeconomic status (SES). We aim to assess inequalities in thinness and obesity in Chinese children and adolescents. Weight and height measurements for 1 677 261 children and adolescents aged 7-18 years were obtained from seven cycles of the Chinese National Surveys on Students Constitution and Health (1985, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014, and 2019). Sex-specific BMI-for-age Z scores were applied to define thinness (Z scores <-2SD) and obesity (Z scores >+2SD). Urban-rural classification came from the Statistical Urban and Rural Division Code, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the province in which the school was situated was used as a proxy for SES. T1 represented the provinces with the most disadvantaged SES and T3 represented the provinces with the most advantaged SES. General linear regression models assessed correlations between prevalence and GDP per capita, with projections to 2030 derived from best-fitting models. The mean prevalence of obesity rose from 0·10% (95% CI 0·09 to 0·11) in 1985 to 8·25% (8·13 to 8·37) in 2019, whereas thinness prevalence decreased from 8·49% (8·41 to 8·58) to 3·37% (3·29 to 3·45). High SES provinces exhibited a significant drop in obesity prevalence from 2014 (8·42% [8·19 to 8·65]) to 2019 (7·73% [7·52 to 7·95]). Nationally, the prevalence of obesity was consistently higher in urban areas than in rural areas for both sexes from 1985 to 2019; however, a greater prevalence of obesity was observed in rural than urban girls residing in T3 regions in 2019 (urban-rural gap: -0·37% [-0·07 to -0·80]). Rural boys had a higher prevalence of thinness than their urban counterparts across all survey waves, with the exceptions of 1985 and 1995. For girls, no significant urban-rural gap in thinness was observed in the most recent survey in 2019 (-0·10% [-0·24 to 0·04]). From 1985 to 2014, boys and girls from high SES regions had a higher risk of obesity and a lower risk of thinness than those from low SES regions. However, in 2019, a nationwide shift occurred, and the T3-T1 difference in obesity approached or went below zero for boys (-0·49% [-1·02 to 0·04]) and girls (-0·68% [-1·00 to -0·35]). T3-T1 differences in thinness also approached zero for boys (-0·46% [-0·77 to -0·14]) and girls (-0·14% [-0·43 to 0·15]). The projected estimates to 2030 for urban-rural obesity gaps (boys: -1·00% [-2·65 to 0·65]; girls: -2·88% [-6·91 to 1·15]) and T3-T1 obesity differences (boys: -8·88% [-13·76 to -4·01]; girls: -8·82% [-12·78 to -4·85]) were both negative, with forecasted estimates for urban-rural gaps and T3-T1 differences in thinness prevalence in 2030 close to zero for both boys and girls. China's socioeconomic development continues to influence within-country inequities regarding the regional distribution of child and adolescent weight according to urban-rural location and regional SES. Contemporary Chinese children and adolescents in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions and rural areas constitute a vulnerable population facing nutritional risk, but from obesity rather than thinness. Disrupting projected inequities in obesity will require extensive preventive investments.

This scoping review outlines the current understanding, challenges, available resources, and healthcare needs of women affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) who experience unintended pregnancy (UP). UPs are defined as unwanted, unplanned, or mistimed pregnancies. The impact of UP is multifaceted and carries several additional risks, particularly for women who experience IPV. The experiences and living conditions, including (mental) burdens, resources, care structures, and the needs of unintentionally pregnant women who have experienced IPV, remain mostly unexplored. The review will include the following criteria: (i) reproductive-aged women who have experienced IPV and UP; (ii) publications that provide detailed accounts of the experiences, circumstances, and/or needs of women with UP who have experienced IPV. This study will utilize the JBI methodology for scoping reviews and follow the PRISMA Protocol for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A total of 2,325 papers and gray literature published from 2000 to the present were identified. 1,539 literature items were included in the title and abstract screening. Two researchers will independently choose studies, perform data extraction, and perform data synthesis. Quantitative data will be narratively summarized and qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings will identify research gaps and provide insights into an important topic of reproductive healthcare and the (mental) health situation of a particularly vulnerable group. This will be useful in defining indications for researchers, professionals, and policymakers in public, mental, and reproductive health to conceptualize interdisciplinary and empirical healthcare support for affected women.

In 2017, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) added a voluntary field for conflict of interest (COI) statements ("posted COI") on the abstract page of PubMed, but the extent to which it is used is unknown. This repeated cross-sectional study examined journals and articles indexed on PubMed from 2016 through 2021. We described the proportion of all journals with at least one article that included a posted COI and the percentage of all articles that included a posted COI over time. We also examined 100 randomly selected articles published between June 2021 and May 2022 from each of the 40 highest impact journals. For these, we established whether the articles had published COIs, and, of these, the proportion that included a posted COI. Among approximately 7,000 journals publishing articles each year, the proportion of journals with at least one article with a posted COI statement increased from 25.9% in 2016 to 33.2% in 2021. Among nearly 400,000 articles published each year, the proportion of articles that included a posted COI also increased from 9.0% in 2016 to 43.0% in 2021. Among 3,888 articles published in the 40 highest impact journals in 2021-2022, 30.2% (95% CI: 28.7%-31.6%) had published COIs; of these, 63.3% (95% CI: 60.4%-66.0%) included a posted COI. Use of the PubMed COI statement has increased since it became available in 2017, but adoption is still limited, even among high impact journals. NLM should carry out additional outreach to journals that are not using the statement to promote greater transparency of COIs.

Vaccine hesitancy, a complex behavioral phenomenon, poses a significant global health threat and has gained renewed attention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper scrutinized peer-reviewed literature on vaccine hesitancy published from 2015 to 2022, with a specific focus on behavioral perspectives, utilizing a Theories-Constructs-Variables-Contexts-Methods (TCVCM) framework. The study highlighted prominent theoretical approaches, abstract concepts, research variables, global contexts and academic techniques employed across a selected sample of 138 studies. The result is a consolidated overview of research and schematization of the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy and vaccination behaviors. These include individual-level, contextual, vaccine-specific, organizational, and public-policy-related dynamics. The findings corroborated the complexity of vaccine hesitancy and emphasized the difficulties of pursuing vaccine advocacy. The analysis also identified several directions for future research, and the need to conduct more contextual studies in low- and middle-income nations to bring out the cross-cultural nuances of vaccine hesitancy.

Innovation has in common the promise of benefit for patients; however, past experience has shown that this promise is not always delivered. Instead, low-value innovation might encourage treatment variation and dilute the available body of evidence. This study aims to investigate (1) whether the peer-review process is capable of filtering out low-value innovation appropriately, and (2) whether low-value surgical innovation would be preferred more often than nonoperative innovation by peer-reviewers in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures in the elderly. Two duplicated sham scientific abstracts, respectively introducing a low-value surgical innovation and a valuable nonsurgical innovation, were submitted to nineteen peer-reviewed scientific meetings worldwide for orthopedic trauma surgery with submission deadlines between 01/01/2022 and 31/12/2022. Decision regarding abstract acceptance was compared. There was a high acceptance rate for the abstract introducing low-value surgical innovation (12 out of 19 (63.2 %)), which was higher than that of a nonoperative duplicate (10 out of 19 (52.6 %)), but this difference was not statistically significant ( There is a high acceptance rate for low-value surgical innovation among peer-reviewed scientific meetings. However, we can not conclude that low-value surgical innovation is preferred more often than nonoperative innovation by peer-reviewers as the differences in acceptance rate were small and not statistically significant. The peer-review process may be suitable as value-based medicine emerges. Scientists should be encouraged to pursue value-based innovation.

Creating an overview of the existing literature about peer support in paediatrics, with a focus on children with chronic diseases. An online search was conducted in MEDLINE and Web of Science. English, Dutch or French articles published between 1 January 2000 and 10 May 2023 were included, based on title and abstract. In this review, 47 articles were included, identifying following themes: Health-Related Quality of Life (n = 8), peer support for parents/siblings (n = 6), social environment (n = 2), and peer support programme for children (n = 31) subdivided in: general concept (n = 13), online (n = 11), camps (n = 6), and development of a peer support programme (n = 1). Peer support aims to improve disease-related knowledge, coping, and management of the disease, as well as creating a positive mindset and decreasing the disease burden. There is no consensus regarding which peer group design was superior. Peer groups aim to increase knowledge and psychological adaptation, and decrease physical symptoms and side effects. It is desired to start the peer mentor programme within 1 year after diagnosis or during a critical incident. Further investigation needs to determine the optimal age to start these groups and the format (online or in-person). Communication between mentors and their mentees was crucial in the succeeding of the programme, as well as creating a safe environment to share experiences. Even though research is still needed concerning peer-to-peer support for children, there is already a lot known about similar programmes for parents of children with chronic diseases.

On the effectiveness of a new advisory service for parents of children in need of care: a controlled study 

Many nurses report feeling underprepared and insecure about the mandated reporting of concern for child maltreatment, which is further compounded by parental disability. This scoping review examined the body of literature on nurse mandated reporting responsibility within the context of parental disability. A scoping review was conducted as informed by the Arksey and O'Malley Framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Initial database search identified 2,669 records, which then underwent title and abstract screening (n = 2458), assessment for full text review (n = 53), and full review (n = 28). Analysis of 106 quantitative and 22 qualitative variables revealed sparse evidence and guidance to help nurses navigate mandated reporting of child abuse in families with parental disability. Findings identified opportunities to inform research, policy, and practice to better meet the needs of nurse mandated reporters and families with parental disability.

Adolescence is a critical developmental stage for young people as they transition into adulthood. Several important developmental tasks that must be completed during this transition include exploring one's identity, developing and applying abstract thinking, adjusting to a new physical sense of self, and fostering stable and productive peer relationships while striving for autonomy and independence from parents. Young people begin to adopt a personal value system and form their racial and ethnic, social, sexual, and moral identity within a society that may provide conflicting and nonaffirming messages. Adolescent development strives toward an affirmed sense of self and self-esteem, which is best accomplished within a nurturing psychosocial context that fosters positive youth development. Youth-focused interventions should intentionally promote affirmation of ancestry and cultural identity, intersections with other historically marginalized identities, and critical consciousness. Fostering healing environments that affirm and address the radical need for change, coaching parents and guardians as critical agents in the creation of affirmative environments for development, and conducting research using anti-oppressive approaches are additional strategies to promote positive youth development. Simultaneously, structural transformations that address underlying social inequities are needed. Health care systems should continue to diversify the workforce and train staff and clinicians in integrative, identity-based, and healing-centered approaches. Organizations should consider training in diversity and competencies related to belonging while safeguarding inclusion with policies, procedures, and practices. Public health and policymakers can embed intersectional approaches within structural and systemic processes, particularly in all policies.

The objective is to gather evidence on ways to integrate DEIA into the didactic and experiential pharmacy classroom based on AACP's 2021-2024 Strategic Plan Objective 3.3.1. to "compile and publish resources related to best practices in inclusive pedagogy, creating inclusive classrooms, navigating difficult conversations, and promoting equitable campus climates for use by schools and colleges of pharmacy.". Sixteen publications were identified (14 peer-reviewed manuscripts and two poster abstracts). Of those, two explored the utilization of technology to make lesson plans more inclusive; seven discussed ways for students to address implicit biases, microaggressions, and navigating difficult conversations; five focused on accommodating students with disabilities; one discussed developing better pronunciation of students' names; and one discussed a method to improve student's self-awareness and awareness of other cultures. Although evidence was found on integrating DEIA into the didactic and experiential settings, the amount of evidence found is limited, warranting further research.

Socioeconomic status is a key social determinant of health. Compared with individual-level socioeconomic status, the association between area-level socioeconomic status and mortality has not been well investigated in China. We aimed to assess associations between area-level socioeconomic status and all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in China, as well as the interplay of area-level and individual-level socioeconomic status on mortality. In this nationwide cohort study, residents aged 35-75 years from 453 districts and counties were included in the China Health Evaluation and Risk Reduction Through Nationwide Teamwork (ChinaHEART) Study. The composite value of area-level socioeconomic status was generated from national census data and categorised into tertiles. Mortality rates and their 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Cox frailty models were fitted to calculate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for area-level socioeconomic status with the risk of all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and their disparities across different population. We also assessed the roles of multiple individual factors as potential mediators. Between December, 2015, and December, 2022, 1 119 027 participants were included, for whom the mean age was 56·1 (SD 9·9) years and 672 385 (60·1%) were female. 24 426 (5·24 [95% CI 5·18-5·31] per 1000 person-years) deaths occurred during the median 4·5-year follow-up. Compared with high area-level socioeconomic status, low area-level socioeconomic status was significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause (hazard ratio 1·11, 95% CI 1·07-1·16), cardiovascular disease (1·38, 1·29-1·48), and respiratory disease (1·44, 1·22-1·71) mortality. The stronger associations were observed in people older than 60 years, females, and participants with lower individual-level socioeconomic status. The individual-level socioeconomic, behavioural, and metabolic factors mediated 39·5% of the association between area-level socioeconomic status and mortality, of which individual-level socioeconomic status made the largest contribution. There are substantial area-level socioeconomic status-related inequalities in mortality in China. Individual-level socioeconomic, behavioural, and metabolic factors had mediating effects. Actions to improve area-level circumstances and individual factors are needed to improve health equity.

Epistemological Misunderstandings of the German Federal Court of Justice in Criminal Cases Regarding the Null Hypothesis: Verification in the Credibility Assessment 

Grieving is a natural process, and many people adjust with support from family and friends. Around 40% of people would benefit from additional input. Online bereavement support interventions may increase access to support. Evidence regarding their acceptability and effectiveness is emerging but needs to be synthesised. To synthesise evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, impacts and implementation of online interventions to improve wellbeing, coping and quality of life after bereavement. A rapid review of evidence regarding online bereavement support. We appraised study quality using AMSTAR 2 and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. English language articles published 1 January 2010 to 4 January 2024, using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and APA PsycINFO. Eligible articles examined formal and informal online interventions to improve bereavement outcomes. We screened 2050 articles by title and abstract. Four systematic reviews and 35 individual studies were included. Online bereavement support was feasible, acceptable and effective in reducing grief intensity, stress-related outcomes and depression. Where reported, participant retention was typically >70%. Positive impacts included: access to a supportive community at any time, reduced isolation; opportunities to process feelings; normalisation of loss responses; access to coping advice and opportunities for meaning-making and remembrance. Negative impacts included upset due to insensitive comments from others via unmoderated online forums. Online interventions can widen access to acceptable, effective bereavement support and improve outcomes for bereaved people. National policies and clinical guidelines relating to bereavement support need to be updated to take account of online formats.

To characterize representation and inclusion among Sleep Research Society members and examine associations between sociodemographic features and Sleep Research Society experiences. The Sleep Research Society Taskforce for Diversity and Inclusion developed a web-based questionnaire in 2021, assessing membership data and Sleep Research Society experiences (self-initiated and society-initiated participation, feeling very welcomed, perceptions of inclusiveness, and diversity of viewpoints represented). Frequencies were calculated and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variance were fit to estimate associations. Most participants (n = 388; 35.7% of members) were aged 18-49 (61%), non-Hispanic White (65%), and women (59%). Regarding inclusion, 41% participated in ≥2 Sleep Research Society self-initiated activities (abstract submission), 56% in Sleep Research Society-initiated activities (appointed position), 51% felt welcomed, whereas 52% perceived a lack of inclusivity and 65% a lack of diverse viewpoints. Historically minoritized groups and women felt less welcomed compared to non-Hispanic White members and men. Older, biracial, women, gender-divergent, and U.S.-born individuals, were less likely to perceive that there was a diversity of viewpoints represented in the Sleep Research Society. Members of ≥10years and those with a doctoral degree were more likely to participate in Sleep Research Society activities, while sexual and gender minoritized individuals were less likely to do so. Sexual and gender minoritized individuals were more likely to report Sleep Research Society was noninclusive. Historically minoritized individuals are under-represented in Sleep Research Society and a majority of respondents report not feeling welcomed. These results serve as a baseline benchmark and example for assessing the impact of ongoing and future diversity and inclusion initiatives and provide targets for expanding opportunities for underrepresented individuals in sleep/circadian societies.

The prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) in India is 11%, which is one of the highest rates globally. Existing research on HDPs in India primarily focuses on biological risk factors, with minimal research on how socioecological factors combine to increase risk of HDPs. We conducted a rapid review using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model to understand the social and cultural factors associated with HDPs among Indian pregnant women to identify possible intervention targets that may uniquely improve health in this population. Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model is a framework that can be used to understand the complex relationship between multiple influences on health. We reviewed studies published between January 2010 and January 2024 using PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Search terms included variants of hypertension, pregnancy, and India. Inclusion criteria were: (1) peer-reviewed journal article; (2) published between January 2010 to January 2024; (3) participants consisted of Indian women living in India; (4) studies evaluated socioecological risk factors associated with HDPs. One independent reviewer performed searches, screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. Each included study was then organized within Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model. A total of 921 studies were generated from the initial search, with 157 exclusions due to duplicates. Following screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria at the title/abstract and full text levels, 17 studies remained in the final review. Socioecological risk factors of HDPs were identified at each level, with the most commonly identified influences including: low socioeconomic status (SES), lacking community education and knowledge on HDP management and prevention, and lacking prenatal HDP screening. This study determined that the high risk for HDPs in India is influenced by many intertwined socioecological factors. Women in rural and low SES areas need more health education on HDP management and prevention. There also needs to be more adequate prenatal HDP screening, with at least 4 and ideally 8 prenatal visits. Prenatal screenings should be accompanied with culturally appropriate patient education, especially for low SES women who have limited literacy, so that they can effectively make individual and microsystemic lifestyle decisions aimed at either managing or preventing HDPs.

This article traces the evolution of the Big Events framework since it began as an attempt to understand why sociopolitical transitions in the Former Soviet Union, South Africa, and Indonesia were followed by HIV outbreaks. Big Events frameworks have evolved over time, but all versions try to concretize how macrosocial changes lead to social, personal and environmental changes that shape risk environments and drug use or other behavioral patterns in ways that may lead to epidemics. Important stages in the evolution of the Big Events framework included understanding that the sequelae of Big Events were contingent rather than deterministic, and the development of new survey measures to understand pathways through which Big Events affect social and epidemiologic outcomes. On a broader level, the Big Events framework is a useful crystallization and application of more abstract sociological, social epidemiologic and Marxist frameworks about upstream/downstream relationships and how major social changes are related to epidemics. As such, they raise issues of how to conduct research on dialectical interaction processes. On another level, this article traces the Big Events "style of thought" as Mannheim (Mannheim, 1971) termed it, within the historical context of changes in public health and social science theory, particularly during and after the 1960s.

Obstetric violence involves the mistreatment, disrespect, and abuse of birthing people and the problem has been recognized in healthcare systems worldwide. Obstetric violence is a gendered, sex-specific form of violence against women that is a public health problem and a violation of human rights. There are an unknowable number of online posts and social media messages that describe obstetric violence experiences. There are no known studies about self-published experiences of obstetric violence in the US maternity care system. To understand the meaning of obstetric violence experiences in the US maternity care system from a naturally occurring, purposive sample. A secondary analysis of the textual data from the original Break the Silence social media campaign using qualitative content analysis. The theory of social justice in nursing provided a theoretical framework. A healthcare systems approach was used for a wide-angle view of the multidirectional structure, processes, and outcome of obstetric violence. The study setting is the public Facebook page where the Break the Silence social media campaign can be seen. Break the Silence was an online activism response to the problem of obstetric violence in the US maternity care system with signboard messages posted from 31 known US states. The setting is bounded by the digital page where the campaign is published. There were 139 participants, and 11 of them posted more than one signboard message. Most participants were birthing people (n = 125) followed by doulas (n = 10). Krippendorff's methodology for qualitative content analysis was applied to 156 signboard messages posted on Break the Silence from 2014 to 2016. Qualitative content analysis was supported by Atlas.ti 23. Four themes illustrated the meaning of obstetric violence in US maternity care: 1) pregnancy and birth as a battle with healthcare providers and the healthcare system, 2) sacrifice of the maternal body normalized and assumed as a gender stereotype, 3) disrupted rites of passage from childbirth, and 4) abuse of fiduciary power by healthcare providers. This study demonstrated thematic meanings for the experience of obstetric violence in US maternity care with a healthcare systems approach that included structural and organizational considerations to increase understanding. Categories and forms of obstetric violence from the existing literature were expanded and strengthened by findings from this study. Themes were validated in principle with consistency in findings across the international evidence base on obstetric violence. The meaning of #obstetricviolence experiences is interpersonal and structural with thematic consistency across international studies.

To provide guidance on ultrasound review of the fetal perineum as well as fetal sex determination and disclosure. All individuals with ongoing pregnancies. To include a review of the fetal perineum and determination of fetal sex as a component of the anatomic review during the routine second-trimester obstetric ultrasound and adhere to patient wishes regarding the disclosure of fetal sex. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal genital and sex anomalies or variants, parental and pregnancy caregiver knowledge of fetal sex, and adherence to parental wishes regarding knowledge of fetal sex. Benefits include the potential to improve perinatal outcomes through the diagnosis of fetal genital anomalies and respect for women's rightful autonomy over personal health information. Potential harms or costs include a possible error in fetal sex determination, increased time for patients and health care providers in scheduling and performing the imaging, and the minimal risk of patients choosing to abort a pregnancy if the fetus is not the desired sex. Evidence built on the literature from the prior version of this statement through a review of international guidelines, Canadian legal rulings, and a literature search of PubMed and the Cochrane Database. English language research articles, review articles, and systematic reviews between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2023, were included. Search terms included fetal ultrasonography, sex determination, and genitalia. The references of relevant articles were assessed, and applicable articles were included as well. All care providers for pregnant individuals in Canada. Fetal genitalia should be examined in pregnancy and the sex safely disclosed to the patient if they want this information. CONSENSUS-BASED GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENTS.

The ageing population of the culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population is increasing in Australia. This is because the number of early migrants in Australia is ageing, coupled with increasing family reunification. This scoping review aimed to describe the nature and extent of research on the barriers to aged care services for CALD older adults in Australia using Penchansky and Thomas's Access to Care Framework of five A's dimensions: availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, and acceptability. Arksey and O'Malley's five-step scoping review framework was adopted to search 6 databases from inception till August 2024. Title/abstract and full-text screening were conducted using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with supplementary search of references from included articles to identify additional articles. Findings show that while all the five A's of access to care services were barriers for CALD older adults, accommodation and acceptability of services were the major areas of concern due to the lack of cultural sensitivity of such services in Australia. An additional barrier captured and termed as Awareness was noted in some of the included studies, highlighting the need to expand the five A's to 6 A's. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers on ageing could leverage these findings to improve cultural practice sensitivities when supporting these populations.

When clinically effective, cost-effective health interventions are not fully implemented in clinical practice, population health suffers. Economic factors are among the most commonly cited reasons for suboptimal implementation. Despite this, implementation and economic evaluation are not routinely performed in conjunction with one another. This review sought to identify and describe what methods are available for researchers to incorporate implementation within economic evaluation, how these methods differ, when they should be used, and where gaps remain. We conducted a scoping review using systematic methods. A pearl-growing approach was used to identify studies. References and citations were identified using Web of Science and Scopus. We included for review any study that contained terms relating to economic evaluation and a series of implementation-related terms in the title or abstract. The search was conducted and validated using two independent researchers. Our review identified 42 unique studies that included a methodology for combining implementation and economic evaluation. The methods identified could be categorized into four broad themes: (i) policy cost-effectiveness approach (11 studies), (ii) value of information and value of implementation approach (16 studies), (iii) mixed methods approach (6 studies), and (iv) costing approach (9 studies). We identified a trend over time from methods that adopted the policy cost-effectiveness approach to methods that considered the trade-off between the value of information and value of implementation. More recently, mixed methods approaches to incorporate economic evaluation and implementation have been developed, alongside methods to define, measure and cost individual components of the implementation process for use in economic evaluation. Our review identified a range of methods currently available for researchers considering implementation alongside economic evaluation. There is no single method or tool that can incorporate all the relevant issues to fully incorporate implementation within an economic evaluation. Instead, there are a suite of tools available, each of which can be used to answer a specific question relating to implementation. Researchers, reimbursement agencies and national and local decision-makers need to consider how best to utilize these tools to improve implementation.

Gaza has long been subjected to food insecurity; however, little was known about the influence of food insecurity on the nutritional wellbeing of schoolchildren. To fill this gap, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which provides humanitarian relief to Palestine refugees, assessed the nutritional status, diet, and food security of refugee children about to enter first grade (aged 4-10 years, mean age 72·1 months) in mid-2023 during a required health examination. As part of an annual School Entrance Health Examinations that began in May, a cross-sectional food security and nutritional assessment was added from July 8, to Sept 7, 2023, during which children being examined at six study-designated UNRWA clinics across Gaza were systematically sampled (in a 1:4 ratio) and parental or guardian consent sought for their participation. Household food security was assessed by a seven-point Arab Family food Security Scale score, and respondents were asked about family receipt of food assistance. The 1-week meal patterns of the children were probed, and intake frequencies of 49 foods in the past month categorised into ten nutritious food groups to assess diet diversity. The weight, height, and haemoglobin concentrations (assessed with a photometric analyser) of the children were measured. The UNRWA Research Review Board approved all study procedures. Approximately 34 000 children underwent the annual School Entrance Health Examination in Gaza in May, 2023 and approximately 16 000 children were estimated to have completed the additional food security and nutritional assessments from July 8, to early Sept 7, 2023, of whom 3814 were systematically sampled at six UNRWA clinics across Gaza, with 3229 (84·7%) parents or guardians consenting for their children to participate. 3155 were interviewed about household food security with a seven-point Arab Family Food Security Score, and 3212 were asked about food assistance receipt. 2694 (83·9%) of 3212 households were on food assistance, 787 (24·9%) of 3155 were classified as food secure (0-2 points), 1025 (32·5%) were classified as moderately (3-5 points) food insecure, and 1343 (42·6%) as severely food insecure (6-7 points). 219 (28·5%) of 768 children reported missing breakfast and 213 (28·4%) of 750 reported missing dinner in the food-secure group, 438 (47·2%) of 928 reported missing breakfast and 426 (45·6%) of 934 reported missing dinner in the moderately food-insecure group, and 956 (75·5%) of 1267 reported missing breakfast and 951 (74·8%) of 1272 reported missing dinner in the severely food-insecure group. Lunch was missed daily by 30 (3·8%) of 786 children in the food-secure group, 54 (5·3%) of 1023 in the moderately food-insecure group, and 193 (14·5%) of 1334 in the severely food-insecure group. Diets were poor in dairy items, meat, poultry, fish, pulses, eggs, and vitamin A-rich vegetables and fruit, and 2225 (68·9%) of 3229 children did not consume a minimally diverse diet every day (≥5 nutritious food groups). 72 (2·5%) of 2913 children had stunting and 129 (4·4%) of 2913 had wasting (less than -2 Z scores), and 963 (29·8%) of 3229 had anaemia (haemoglobin <11·5 g/dL). Boys and girls were similar in their diets, anthropometric Z scores, and prevalence of anaemia. Gazan families with children about to enter first grade were food insecure and reliant on food assistance, possibly protecting the anthropometric status of the children, whose diets however lacked diversity.

Due to the geographical distance, work obligations, and parenting responsibilities, it is often difficult for parents to visit the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Limited parent presence might also constrain updates about infant status thus increasing anxiety, which potentially leads to a stronger necessity for visitation. Examine the evidence for use of electronic visit (eVisit) technology for parents of newborns in NICU, for example, do eVisits decrease anxiety and are there other factors that demonstrate effectiveness. Seven databases were used to search for evidence from 1 January 2000 to 13 November 2023. Studies were included with terms related to eHealth, NICU, infant, parent and 41 eligible studies were assessed. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers with a systematic-staged review approach. Eight studies with a total of 1450 cases were included. Results of meta-analysis showed that eVisit technology improved anxiety compared with conventional visitation (MD = - 5.04, 95% CI [-5.92, - 4.17], P < .01) and hospitalization satisfaction (RR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.05, 1.13], P < .01), but the effect was not significant with regard to reduction in infant length of stay (MD = - 1.07, 95% CI [-5.39, 3.25], P = .63). A large sample, high-quality, multi-centered randomized controlled study needs to be conducted to validate the effect of eVisit technology on the psychological state of parents, implications for nursing practice as well as potential newborn affects to improve future ease of use. Available for more insights from the authors. This video shows the concept, current status, significance, and implications for practice and research of eVisit technology.

Asthma is a prevalent chronic disease affecting school-age children, with substantial psychosocial implications for children and their parents. This review aimed to synthesise current evidence on the effects of psychosocial interventions for families of school-age children with asthma and investigate the optimal features of effective interventions. Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, CNKI, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception to November 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining psychosocial interventions in children aged six to twelve with asthma on asthma symptoms and parental stress were included. Emergency department visits, hospitalisations, lung function, psychological symptoms and health-related quality of life in both children and parents were secondary outcomes. Data were pooled for short-term (≤ three months), medium-term (> three months and ≤ six months), and long-term (> six months) follow-ups. Risk of bias was appraised using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1. Seven RCTs with 884 parent-child dyads from two countries were included. Meta-analyses found that psychosocial interventions improved asthma control (k = 2, n = 301, standardised mean difference [SMD] 0.35, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 0.58, P = 0.003), sleep problem (k = 2, n = 149, SMD -0.47, 95 % CI -0.79 to -0.14, P = 0.005), cough (k = 2, n = 149, SMD -0.97, 95 % CI -1.59 to -0.35, P = 0.002), wheezing (k = 2, n = 149, SMD -0.76, 95 % CI -1.09 to -0.42, P < 0.0001), and parental stress (k = 6, n = 813, SMD -0.32, 95 % CI -0.61 to -0.02, P = 0.03), compared to controls in the short term. Subgroup analysis revealed significant effects of psychoeducation, family empowerment interventions, and acceptance and commitment therapy-based interventions on reducing parental stress. No significant intervention effects were observed on parental symptoms of depression at any follow-up. Narrative synthesis indicated that psychosocial interventions may provide benefits in children's health-related quality of life in the short term, parental symptoms of anxiety in the medium term, and activity limitation, cough, and wheezing in the long term. The intervention effects for other reviewed outcomes were inconsistent. Psychosocial interventions demonstrate possible benefits for families of school-aged children with asthma in asthma symptoms, parental stress, and children's health-related quality of life within three months post-intervention and parental symptoms of anxiety at six months post-intervention. Future research with rigorous design should investigate the optimal duration, frequency, and intervention approaches of psychosocial interventions. Psychosocial interventions improve asthma symptoms and parental stress within three months post-intervention for families of school-age children with asthma @ConnieChong1.

Clinical nursing care is an essential element in pediatric oncology. The body of research interventions targeting pediatric oncology patients and their families has grown in recent years. However, no reviews are currently available on nursing interventions for pediatric oncology. The aim was to develop a comprehensive overview of the available nursing interventions for pediatric oncology patients and their families, outline the characteristics of the interventions, and identify any knowledge gaps. This review was conducted in accordance with the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews. Citations were retrieved from the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase. The following inclusion criteria were applied: peer-reviewed studies written in English, Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish from 2000 onward and reporting on pediatric patients with cancer and/or family members of a pediatric patient with cancer who received non-pharmacological and non-procedural nursing interventions provided by a pediatric oncology hospital service. Eligible studies were screened by title and abstract, and in full text by two independent reviewers. Critical appraisal was achieved using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Among 2762 references, 26 studies met the inclusions criteria, comprising 25 unique nursing interventions. 89 % had been published from 2013 onward, reflecting the rapid changes occurring in pediatric oncology treatment. 36 % were qualitative, 58 % were quantitative and 8 % employed mixed methods. The studies were characterized by considerable diversity in terms of intervention content, components, timing of delivery, and delivery mode. 60 % of the interventions were targeted parents among whom mothers were highly overrepresented (75 %). 16 % adopted a family-centered focus. This review contributes to building a more comprehensive understanding of the evidence base within pediatric oncology nursing research. This field is evolving and holds the potential to support families with childhood cancer across various phases of their treatment trajectory. However, a clear need exists to develop and test interventions with a genuinely family-centered focus, targeting both patients and family members. A considerable gap exists in reporting of the intervention development process and intervention characteristics. Improving the reporting of intervention development is needed to enhance research quality and facilitate subsequent adaptation or upscaling of interventions for use in other populations and contexts. Nursing interventions can support families with childhood cancer but future intervention studies need to enhance transparency in reporting @IJNSjournal.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. There is an association between certain social determinants of health (SDOH) and adverse cancer outcomes. These include Black race and low-income, which are associated with poorer adherence to lung cancer screening and presentation at a later stage of disease. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer at a single urban, academic center from 2015 to 2021. Demographic data including race and clinical data including time taken to progress through various checkpoints (ie, concerning CT scan to diagnosis, diagnosis to treatment) were collected. Income data was approximated based on population medians at patient's home address zip code. A total of 550 patients were included in the final analysis. The study population was 57.4% Black and 61.2% of patients presenting with a household income of $40,000 US Dollars or lower based on approximated median household income. The time from CT scan to first treatment for the entire cohort was 121.3 days with no statistically significant variance by race. However, among patients presenting at stage IV, 72.7% were black and 76.0% resided in a zip code with a median income < $40,000. This study demonstrated no significant delays in progressing through checkpoints of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment on the basis of race or income approximation. Black patients and patients in low-income households were diagnosed with lung cancer at a more advanced stage. Efforts to close the gap in lung cancer disparities should be focused on targeting screening and early identification toward social groups that may be at highest risk of late presentation. Institutional focus on patient navigation through these stages should be paramount. There were no delays in progression to lung cancer diagnostic and therapeutic milestones based on race or income approximation. Black race and residing in a low-income area are predictors for presenting at stage IV.

During pregnancy and the early parenting period, women are especially vulnerable to intimate partner violence (IPV), with devastating impacts on women, children, and families. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of father-focused interventions to prevent or reduce IPV during pregnancy and early parenthood. Six databases were searched, using a combination of the concepts "fathers," "pregnancy/early parenthood," "IPV" and "intervention." Articles were double screened by title and abstract, and then full-text. Methodological and reporting quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies tool. Fifteen papers were eligible for inclusion; these articles were mostly of poor-to-moderate quality. Only three of the articles reported on interventions in lower- and middle-income countries. The most common forms of IPV addressed in these interventions were physical (10), psychological (8), sexual (4), and economic/financial (3). Of 12 articles reporting on data from both intervention and control groups, only six indicated statistically significant results; among these, only three reported robust analyses showing significantly greater reduction in IPV in intervention than in control groups. All three took place in lower- or middle-income countries. Two were underpinned by theoretical frameworks, which considered transforming traditional perceived gender norms. Therefore, interventions based on principles that address transformation of gender norms show promise but the success of such underlying principles needs to be confirmed, and better-quality evidence and reporting are needed for interventions targeting fathers to prevent or reduce IPV.

Refugees encounter multiple psychosocial stressors post-resettlement which increases their risk of developing a mental illness. Loneliness and social isolation are commonly reported in the refugee population and have been demonstrated to be associated with multiple physical and mental health comorbidities in the general population. However, no study to date has systematically reviewed how loneliness and social isolation may affect refugees who have resettled in high-income countries. This systematic review aims to study the prevalence, risk factors, consequences, and interventions for loneliness and social isolation among refugees who have resettled in high-income countries. Systematic searches on five electronic databases yielded 2950 papers, of which 69 were deemed eligible following a double-blinded review by title and abstract then later by full text. From the included studies, it was found that the reported range of prevalence rates of loneliness (15.9-47.7%) and social isolation (9.8-61.2%) were higher than population norms. Risk factors associated with loneliness and social isolation included family separation, acculturative stress, being female or a parent and a current diagnosis of a mental illness. Loneliness and social isolation were found to be associated with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress as well as physical health problems. Only three interventions addressing loneliness and social isolation were identified which demonstrates the importance of integrating social support in refugee psycho-social support programs. In summary, loneliness and social isolation were reported by a large proportion of refugees who have resettled in high-income countries. Whilst certain risk factors were pre-migratory and static, most were post-migratory in nature and were found to adversely affect mental and physical health. Thus, interventions focused on reducing loneliness and social isolation that are guided by the needs of refugee communities are urgently required.

Children utilizing invasive home mechanical ventilation (administered via tracheostomy tube) receive intensive care at home without the support of trained staff typically present in an intensive care unit; within the context of worsening home nursing shortages, much of the 24/7 care burden falls to families which are likely under supported. Prior reviews have explored the quality of life of children receiving various forms of mechanical ventilation, without addressing the impact on the family. Additionally, the literature inconsistently differentiates the unique experience of families with children using invasive home mechanical ventilation from non-invasive, which has lower morbidity and mortality and requires less nursing care in the home. Therefore, our study aims to explore and map the existing literature regarding the impact of invasive home mechanical ventilation on the child and family's quality of life. Identified gaps will inform future research focused on improving the family quality of life of children with invasive home mechanical ventilation. Five databases will be searched using keywords and controlled vocabulary to identify relevant studies: Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. English language studies will meet inclusion criteria if they include primary research studies of children or families of children utilizing invasive home mechanical ventilation at home and assess quality of life. Children and young adults aged 0-25 years will be included. We exclude studies of hospitalized children, studies focused solely on healthcare professional experiences or clinical outcomes, and those focused on the period surrounding discharge from admission for tracheostomy placement. Two independent reviewers will screen studies at the title/abstract and full-text levels. Two independent reviewers will extract data from relevant studies. Disagreements will be resolved by an independent third reviewer. A targeted grey literature search will be performed utilizing ProQuest, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO trial registry, Google Scholar, and professional societies. Findings will be presented in tables and figures along with a narrative summary. This scoping review seeks to map the literature and provide a descriptive report of the health-related quality of life of children using invasive home mechanical ventilation and their families.

Social isolation and loneliness (SIL) are public health challenges that disproportionally affect individuals who experience structural and socio-economic exclusion. The social and health outcomes of SIL for people with experiences of being unhoused have largely remained unexplored. Yet, there is limited synthesis of literature focused on SIL to appropriately inform policy and targeted social interventions for people with homelessness experience. The aim of this scoping review is to synthesize evidence on SIL among people with lived experience of homelessness and explore how it negatively impacts their wellbeing. We carried out a comprehensive literature search from Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science's Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1st, 2000 to January 3rd, 2023. Studies went through title, abstract and full-text screening conducted independently by at least two reviewers. Included studies were then analyzed and synthesized to identify the conceptualizations of SIL, measurement tools and approaches, prevalence characterization, and relationship with social and health outcomes. The literature search yielded 5,294 papers after removing duplicate records. Following screening, we retained 27 qualitative studies, 23 quantitative studies and two mixed method studies. SIL was not the primary objective of most of the included articles. The prevalence of SIL among people with homelessness experience varied from 25 to 90% across studies. A range of measurement tools were used to measure SIL making it difficult to compare results across studies. Though the studies reported associations between SIL, health, wellbeing, and substance use, we found substantial gaps in the literature. Most of the quantitative studies were cross-sectional, and only one study used health administrative data to ascertain health outcomes. More studies are needed to better understand SIL among this population and to build evidence for actionable strategies and policies to address its social and health impacts.

Social decision-making is guided by a complex set of social norms. Computational modeling can play a significant role in enriching our understanding of these norms and how precisely they direct social choices. Here, we highlight three major advantages to using computational modeling, particularly models derived from Utility Theory, in the study of social norms. We illustrate how such models can help generate detailed processes of decision-making, enforce theoretical precision by delineating abstract concepts, and unpack when, and why, people adhere to specific social norms. For each benefit, we discuss a recent study which has employed modeling in the service of assessing the role of norms in decision-making, collectively revealing how computational modeling enables better prediction, description, and explanation of important social choices.

We describe a first-of-its-kind audit of LGBTQ+ inclusivity in fertility care providers across the United Kingdom. Despite efforts being made to improve LGBTQ+ inclusion in fertility care, our results paint a picture of widespread gaps in clinical and cultural expertise alongside significant barriers to LGBTQ+ inclusion. LGBTQ+ patients comprise one of the fastest-growing user demographics in fertility care, yet they remain under-represented in fertility research, practice, and discourse. Existing studies have revealed significant systemic barriers, including cisheteronormativity, discrimination, and gaps in clinical expertise. In this article, we present a checklist of measures that clinics can take to improve LGBTQ+ inclusion in fertility care, co-created with members of the LGBTQ+ community. This checklist focuses on three key areas: cultural competence, clinical considerations, and online presence. The cultural competence criteria encompass inclusive communication practices, a broad understanding of LGBTQ+ healthcare needs, and knowledge of treatment options suitable for LGBTQ+ individuals. Clinical considerations include awareness of alternative examination and gamete collection techniques for transgender and gender diverse patients, the existence of specific clinical pathways for LGBTQ+ patients, and sensitivity to the psychological aspects of fertility care unique to this demographic. The online presence criteria evaluate provider websites for the use of inclusive language and the availability of LGBTQ+-relevant information. The checklist was used as the foundation for an audit of fertility care providers across the UK in early 2024. Our audit identified a widespread lack of LGBTQ+ inclusion, particularly for transgender and gender diverse patients, highlighting deficiencies in clinical knowledge and cultural competence. Our work calls attention to the need for further efforts to understand the barriers to inclusive and competent LGBTQ+ fertility care from both healthcare provider and patient perspectives.

The internet is a crucial platform for individuals to gain social support, enhancing their well-being. However, research indicated that while online social support (OSS) has positive aspects, it also carries potential drawbacks and can lead to problematic Internet use (PIU). This study aims to examine the complex relationship between OSS and PIU. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed across five English and three Chinese databases. A total of 1966 articles were initially screened by title, followed by abstract, and finally, full text. And the random-effects model was used to synthesize the included 31 studies. 31 studies were identified, encompassing a total sample of 22,375 participants. Meta-analysis revealed a moderate and significant correlation between OSS and PIU (r = 0.293), and it was significantly moderated by gender and the measurement methods of PIU. Notably, the relationship was more pronounced in studies with a higher proportion of female participants; when PIU was measured by problematic social media use, the relationship with OSS was stronger than studies that measured PIU by general problematic Internet use or problematic mobile phone use. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the association between OSS and PIU, and carry implications for identifying and addressing the potential risks associated with social support provision in the digital realm.

The aim of the article is to analyze the current state of functioning of the medical information space of Ukraine in order to formulate scientifically sound proposals aimed at improving the implementation of medical reform. The study is based on the analysis of literary sources of Ukrainian and international scientists, Ukrainian and foreign legislation and judicial practice. The article uses general theoretical and special methods of scientific cognition: theoretical analysis, systemic and structural, analysis and synthesis, sociological and statistical, logical and semantic, comparative and legal, method of ascent from the abstract to the concrete, forecasting and generalization. One of the key categories of the reform of the Ukrainian national medical sphere - the unified medical information space and its constituent elements - is studied. The electronic health care system, which stores medical data about patients in a single place and ensures their exchange between medical institutions, is analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the possibilities of using telemedicine and artificial intelligence, which play a key role in the development of the unified medical information space in accordance with global trends. The importance of legislative provision of efficiency and safety of the unified medical space is emphasized. It is about regulating the protection of personal data, establishing technical standards and requirements for medical information systems, ensuring confidentiality, integrity and data availability of the unified medical information space. Conclusions are drawn about the importance of proper functioning of each of the elements of the unified medical information space, both individually and in conjunction with each other. The authors' vision of improving the existing system of the unified medical information space is presented.

to analyze the scientific literature on distance education programs for parents/caregivers in the development of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). the PICO strategy was used to identify the research problem. The databases Medline, ERIC, LILACs, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched using specific descriptors and free terms. There were no restrictions on time or language. Articles on online educational programs for parents of children with ASD were selected, focusing on the impact of these programs on the development of children up to six years old. studies were selected based on standard eligibility criteria, including full-text reading after initial screening using the RAYYAN software. Primary studies such as clinical trials and systematic reviews evaluating distance education programs for parents of children with ASD were included. the RAYYAN software was used for initial study selection. Articles were hierarchically organized based on title and abstract, followed by full-text reading to apply eligibility criteria. the initial search yielded 1019 articles, of which 192 were identified as duplicates. After initial screening and full-text reading, 37 articles were analyzed, of which six were deemed eligible to answer the research question. Among the eligible studies, one was a systematic review and five were experimental studies. Experimental studies highlighted positive impacts on areas such as daily routines, behavioral flexibility, and communication. The systematic review provided preliminary evidence that distance education programs for parents can enhance knowledge about ASD, increase adherence to interventions, and foster the development of social and communication skills in children. the findings suggest that remote parent guidance programs may effectively improve knowledge about ASD, increase parent adherence to interventions, and promote the development of social and communication skills in children with ASD.

Despite an aging confined population, the current state of organ transplantation in carceral systems is largely unknown. This scoping review aimed to assess the literature on organ transplantation in populations experiencing incarceration. The review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for a scoping review. Included references were published between January 2000 and January 2022 in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature via EBSCO, EMBASE.com, PsycInfo via EBSCO, Sociological Abstracts via ProQuest, and Scopus. Two reviewers conducted title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction in order to generate common themes. The initial search yielded 3,225 studies, and 2,129 references underwent screening. Seventy studies underwent full-text review, and 10 met inclusion criteria. These studies revealed heterogeneous perspectives and policies by providers and transplant centers regarding transplant consideration of individuals with incarceration history or current involvement. Two studies on a kidney transplant program for patients experiencing incarceration showed transplant as a sustainable and potentially superior option for people who are incarcerated, as compared with chronic hemodialysis. Literature on transplantation for populations experiencing incarceration is sparse. More research is required to understand the demand for transplants and the ethical implications of the heterogeneous perspectives and policies on practice patterns.

Forty-two percent of women who experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) reported that their experience of IPV resulted in an injury. This review aims to review the existing literature from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) on IPV-related injuries as well as identify IPV-related injury patterns and locations. A systematic electronic database search was conducted between August and September 2021 (Prospero ID: CRD42021281519). Five databases yielded 408 articles; 328 remained for title and abstract screening after duplicates were removed. Of the 59 eligible for full-text review, 19 articles were eligible for extraction. After quality assessment, 18 articles were included in the study. Most (56%) studies were observational studies. Studies represented 15 different countries. The majority of the studies (89%) had authors whose institutional affiliation was located in the country where the study took place. Soft tissue injuries were the most commonly reported injury type followed by fractures and burns. The most common injury locations were the head, neck, and face followed by both upper and lower limbs. The most commonly cited injury mechanism was bodily force. The findings of this study echo what has been written in the literature regarding IPV-related injury patterns from high-income countries (HICs). One limitation of this study is that the search only included literature published in English. The injury patterns identified in this article confirm the need for awareness and action on the part of both medical and surgical providers in order to best address IPV in LMICs.

Humans and animals can quickly learn a new strategy when a previously-rewarding strategy is punished. It is difficult to model this with reinforcement learning methods, because they tend to perseverate on previously-learned strategies - a hallmark of impaired response to punishment. Past work has addressed this by augmenting conventional reinforcement learning equations with ad hoc parameters or parallel learning systems. This produces reinforcement learning models that account for reversal learning, but are more abstract, complex, and somewhat detached from neural substrates. Here we use a different approach: we generalize a recently-discovered neuron-level learning rule, on the assumption that it captures a basic principle of learning that may occur at the whole-brain-level. Surprisingly, this gives a new reinforcement learning rule that accounts for adaptation and lose-shift behavior, and uses only the same parameters as conventional reinforcement learning equations. In the new rule, the normal reward prediction errors that drive reinforcement learning are scaled by the likelihood the agent assigns to the action that triggered a reward or punishment. The new rule demonstrates quick adaptation in card sorting and variable Iowa gambling tasks, and also exhibits a human-like paradox-of-choice effect. It will be useful for experimental researchers modeling learning and behavior.

In high-income countries, significant diet-related health inequalities exist between people of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Individuals who face socioeconomic challenges are less likely to meet dietary guidelines, leading to increased incidence and prevalence of morbidity and mortality associated with dietary risk factors. To promote healthy eating, strategies may focus on individual-level factors (e.g., knowledge, skills, and behavior) along with broader societal factors (e.g., social determinants of health). The concept of food literacy is considered an individual-level factor and has been framed as a skill set that individuals must possess to effectively navigate the complexities of the modern food system. Food literacy interventions can be a complementary but effective tool for encouraging healthy eating behavior among diverse populations, including those facing socioeconomic disadvantage. However, there is limited evidence to guide the design of food literacy intervention for vulnerable population groups. In the process of developing an ideal portfolio of solutions and strategies to promote food literacy and healthy eating for people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, this systematic scoping review aims to comprehensively examine the effects of food literacy interventions on promoting food literacy behavior and healthy eating in adults (18 years and above) from various socioeconomic groups (SEGs) in high-income countries. The review includes both qualitative and quantitative papers obtained from academic databases, including MEDLINE (via EBSCOhost), Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition to the electronic search, manual forward and backward citation searching will be conducted to identify additional relevant papers. Food literacy interventions will be evaluated across four domains: planning and management, selection, preparation, and consumption. Papers included in the review will be analyzed for process, impact, and outcome evaluation. The main outcome of a food literacy intervention is the modification in eating behavior, while the mechanism for this action will be through impact measure of food literacy behaviors. Implementation factors will be extracted for process evaluation. This review will also include a range of dietary behavior measures, such as diet quality index and dietary intake indicator. The screening process for all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data will be carried out by two reviewers independently. In case of any potential conflicts, they will be resolved through discussion. The quality of quantitative studies will be reviewed using the JBI critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies. The "Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ)" will be used to report on the quality of qualitative papers. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TPNKU.

December 2019 was momentous since it experienced the trajectory of another novel pathogenic HCoV recognized as 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China, which further unfurled to all countries on the entire globe at lightning speed. The Majority of COVID-19 vaccines are being manufactured using protein subunits, viral vectors, inactivated viruses, as well as DNA and mRNA vaccine platforms. This study aimed to conduct a gender-based review of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population and bibliometric analysis. Various articles related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, either based on their title, abstract, or keywords in the search strategy, were reviewed. For COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, we used the definition of "Reluctance to receive safe and recommended available vaccines". Accordingly, 408 articles were included in the complete evaluation and the bibliometric analysis. Data Analysis was done using the Vos viewer Software. The strength of co-cited publications showed strong contributors from the American and Asian continents. The words with the maximum weightage based on their occurrences were female, health personnel, acceptance, social media, socio-economic factors, and ethnic groups, as covered in the red cluster. On the other hand, the Overlay Visualization on the right side, based on the total link strength of MeSH items, showed the largest clusters with items such as females, attitude to health, trust, cross-sectional studies, the acceptance of healthcare, rural population, public health, and parents, which were toward the center. The terms toward the periphery, which had less weightage, need more analysis. Greater perceived susceptibility, risk perception, benefits, and low levels of barriers and self-efficacy were the prime reasons for getting vaccinated, more specifically among females. In most instances, the female being the decision-maker of the family needs to be attended to first as she can further change the mindset of the entire family and carry the future forward.

The planning and management of health policy is directly linked to evidence-based research. To obtain the most rigorous results in research it is important to have a representative sample. However, ethnic minorities are often not accounted for in research. Migration, equality, and diversity issues are important priorities which need to be considered by researchers. The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to explore the literature examining the experiences of minority language users in Health and Social Care Research (HSCR). A SR of the literature was conducted. SPIDER framework and Cochrane principles were utilised to conduct the review. Five databases were searched, yielding 5311 papers initially. A SR protocol was developed and published in PROSPERO: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020225114analysis. Following the title and abstract review by two reviewers, 74 papers were included, and a narrative account was provided. Six themes were identified: 1. Disparities in healthcare; 2. Maternal health; 3. Mental health; 4. Methodology in health research; 5. Migrant and minority healthcare; 6. Racial and ethnic gaps in healthcare. Results showed that language barriers (including language proficiency) and cultural barriers still exist in terms of recruitment, possibly effecting the validity of the results. Several papers acknowledged language barriers but did not act to reduce them. Despite research highlighting cultures over the past 40 years, there is a need for this to be acknowledged and embedded in the research process. We propose that future research should include details of languages spoken so readers can understand the sample composition to be able to interpret the results in the best way, recognising the significance of culture and language. If language is not considered as a significant aspect of research, the findings of the research cannot be rigorous and therefore the validity is compromised.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Suicide is an important health problem that has been common all over the world in recent years. Nursing students are a high-risk group for suicide. Factors affecting suicide risk should be investigated and included in psychiatric nursing interventions. Psychological pain is a predisposing condition for suicide risk. Studies focus on the relationship between suicide risk and psychological pain. Studies examining the moderator factors affecting this relationship are limited. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: By means of the structural equation model, the effect of resilience mediation on the relationship of suicide risk and psychological pain has been shown. In the process of going from psychological pain to suicide, resilience takes on a buffer function with its mediating effect, and this process can be prevented by the development of resilience. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Resilience can be added as a protective factor for suicide to the practices of psychiatric nursing. Initiatives to strengthen resilience can be added to psychiatric nursing practices. In this way, psychological pain and the risk of suicide can be reduced by strengthening resilience. Psychological pain can be added as a risk factor for suicide to the practices of psychiatric nursing. Within the scope of psychiatric nursing practices, nursing interventions can be structured to assess and reduce psychological pain. Interventions on strategies to manage and cope with psychological pain and initiatives to strengthen resilience can be added to suicide prevention programs created for nursing students. INTRODUCTION: Nursing students are a high-risk group for suicide. Psychiatric nurses should investigate risk factors for suicide. The aim of this study was to examine the resilience mediation effect in the relationship of suicide risk and psychological pain in nursing students. This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and May 2021 with 619 students in the Akdeniz University Faculty of Nursing. A Descriptive Information Form, the Suicide Probability Scale, the Psychache Scale and the Brief Resilience Scale were used to collect data. The structural equation model approach was used to examine the resilience mediating effect on the relation between suicide risk and psychological pain, and Path Analysis was performed. The reporting of the study was conducted according to STROBE. A semi-mediatory effect of resilience was found between psychological pain and the risk of suicide, and the effect size was determined to be broad (0.57). Resilience can be considered as a protective factor for suicide prevention in psychiatric nursing practices. Resilience has an effect on the relationship between psychological pain and suicide risk. The results of this study may guide psychiatric nursing practices in reducing and preventing suicide risk.

This essay analyzes from a personalistic bioethics the model of technological progress supported by an autonomy without controls and an imperative that is governed by the maxim: if it can be done, let's do it!, as a necessary and sufficient condition of progress. This puts us on the slippery slope between the technically feasible and the morally lawful. The pioneering work of the philosopher, José Sanmartin Esplugues 2 , urges reflection in the face of a technological profusion that sees the human being as a useful embodied object and offers powers of intervention on human life that were previously unimaginable. The reduction of the person to mere biological-material data opens the door to increasing deshumanization by subordination to the calculations of an instrumental rationalism. Underlying the desire to see ourselves at the top of the world and genetic techniques are the ultimate expression of a longing for human emancipation that aspires to take the reins of evolution through an abstract postbiological imaginary. Sanmartin proposes a model of ethical evaluation and social insertion of technoscientific activity that goes beyond the conventional categories of impact, use and effectiveness to distinguish social, cultural, economic, political and values correlates, in order to embroider a pattern that decides on the means and ends of human life through technologies that are neither innocuous nor neutral. A society without antidotes to manipulation that also teaches us to cultivate utopian dreams about human nature is easily malleable by elites who promise happy worlds and redeem us from our vulnerability.

Caring for a family member with a mental illness induces a burden on the caregiver, an impact on their quality of life and premature ageing of more than ten years. We conducted systematised and individualised nursing interviews with family members, on the first days of a relative's hospitalisation, during hospitalisation and three months after discharge. We observed persistent depressive symptoms during and after hospitalisation. Burden and depression were higher, and quality of life was lower, for women caregivers and when the caregivers admitted the patients involuntarily in the hospital ward. When the caregivers were experiencing a patient's first hospitalisation, we also found higher depressive symptoms and lower quality of life. This study emphasises the need for new interventions such as psychoeducation to alleviate the suffering of families. Considering the burden of families could become a prevention objective from the patient's first hospitalisation and prevent them from mental or physical health problems. Introduction The burden consequent to providing care to patients with psychiatric chronic conditions is often overlooked by health professionals. Aim We assessed the impact of patients' psychiatric hospitalisation on their caregivers, through evaluating their suffering, burden and quality of life, in three stages: upon the patients' admission, their discharge and 3 months after their discharge. Method In total, 127 caregivers of adult patients whose first hospitalisation was less than 5 years ago were assessed using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, the Zarit Burden Interview and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Results Females and caregivers who admitted patients against their will experienced higher burden and depression and lower mental quality of life. We also found higher depressive symptoms and lower quality of life among caregivers during a patient's first hospitalisation. The caregiver's familial relationship to the patient was not associated with these outcomes. Finally, burden decreased and quality of life increased over time. Discussion Results suggest that several variables associated with patient hospitalisations were correlated with burden, depression or quality of life. Implications for Practice Burden could be targeted with interventions such as group psychoeducation for caregivers during or after the patient's hospitalisation, in order to reduce their distress and improve their quality of life. Psychiatric and mental health nurses can provide support to caregivers with systematic assessments of their burden and quality of life, so as to better meet their needs and promote their ability to cope with mental illness.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new sources of stress and challenges for people dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The study uncovered the unique experiences of Jordanian patients with OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing three main themes: Navigating Constraints: The Dual Pathways of Social Engagement and Avoidance, estranging family attachments and shifting OCD landscapes. Family dynamics played a significant role, with some families unintentionally exacerbating OCD symptoms through excessive accommodation, while others openly expressed irritation, both contributing to worsened symptoms. The research unveiled a notable deficiency in the availability of professional mental health support for individuals with OCD throughout the pandemic. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Accessible and culturally appropriate e-mental health interventions can bridge the gap in mental health support, especially during crises like the pandemic. It is crucial to involve family members in the treatment process to address family dynamics that may either support or hinder recovery among patients with OCD. INTRODUCTION: Pandemics, like COVID-19, can significantly harm the mental well-being and overall quality of life for individuals and their families. Those with pre-existing mental conditions, especially obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), are more vulnerable to negative psychosocial effects since the fear of being infected or transmitting infection to others are some of the main characteristics of the illness. There is a need for a nuanced understanding of the personal, social and cultural experiences of people with OCD within their specific psychosocial context. To explore how Jordanian patients with OCD experienced their illness during COVID-19. A descriptive phenomenological design using semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12 patients diagnosed with OCD and experiencing different types of OCD symptoms. Data were analysed thematically, and reported based on the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies. Three main themes emerged: (1) Navigating Constraints: The Dual Pathways of Social Engagement and Avoidance (seeking solace through social interaction and embracing quarantine as an opportunity for social avoidance); (2) Estranging family attachments (enforcing proximity and struggling with intimacy); and (3) Shifting OCD landscapes (transforming existing obsessions and escaping to new compulsions). The interviews documented a complete lack of references to receiving professional mental health support throughout the pandemic. This study aligns with previous research indicating a surge in OCD severity during the pandemic, fuelled by distressing news and heightened hygiene measures. Notably, it underscores the strain on familial relationships, with some cases showing protective effects but many demonstrating worsening symptoms due to excessive family accommodation. The absence of professional mental health support during the pandemic raises questions about the quality and accessibility of mental health services in Jordan. The findings underscore the need for continued mental health support and intervention, particularly during times of heightened stress and isolation. Integrating e-mental health resources and cultural adaptation can play a vital role in providing accessible and effective support for individuals with OCD, including those in the Jordanian Arab culture. As we navigate future challenges, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being of individuals with OCD and ensure they have access to appropriate and tailored mental health services.
