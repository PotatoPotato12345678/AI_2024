---Preprocessing---
1.Removing URLs
2.Converting all Verbs to presense and singular words to the plural forms by nltk and textblob
3.Removing special characters: º and ˜
4.Lowercasing
5.Replacing words with Latex expression with a special word: º
6.Replacing words with number expression with ˜
7.Removing words with special characters: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + ,. / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
8.Replacing "-" with a single space.
9.Removing stopwards by nltk:

# remove verb

--Complementary explanation--
step 2
This is not to categorize words differently only by tense, -s.

step 3
This removes º˜ in advance not to mix them with transformed words by step4 and step5.

Step 5 and 6
it may be intuitive that some fields often use mathmatical formulas and numbers in text such as physics and astronomy fields.
TF-IDF classiy each mathematical expression as completely different information without processing. Therefore, in order to group them, every latex expression (e.g $R\sim25.5$) is denoted "&%&", and every number expression is denoted as "&#&".

Step 6
the reason for number replacement before the later steps is to incluce number expression information before removing by them. 

Step 8
This is not to separate word meanings only by "-" such as "gamma-ray", and "gamma" and "ray".


--methodology--
5-fold cross-validation

--model--
TF-IDF and Feedfoward neural network

TF-IDF
-pros
This characterizes what particular words appear in each topic.


-cons
It doesn't consider context and word positions.
=> e.g) the word "it" is considered the same meaning all the time.
=> Topic classficaiton can be done without considering semantics.
=> e.g) We can easily assume that psychlogy fields use the word "planet" less than astronomy field.

easily affected by input text length because of frequency property.
=> abstract is around 200 words and considered less affected than other texts such as body texts.
